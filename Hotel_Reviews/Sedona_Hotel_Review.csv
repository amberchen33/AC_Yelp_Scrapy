http://www.yelp.com/biz/casa-sedona-sedona,Casa Sedona,4.5,$$$,19,"Across the board, this is the BEST boutique hotel EVER. This enchanting inn perched up against Thunder Mountain has the power to WOW you while simultaneously making you feel very much at home! True luxury isn't grandiose it's simple and refined... Every small detail from linens to amenities, like fresh baked cookies, hot teas and coffee, and beautiful decor is tended to and nothing is overlooked! Andreas, the inn keeper, made it all about us. He was so warm &amp; hospitable and hugely helpful &amp; knowledgeable. He made us feel welcome and went above and beyond to ensure our comfort at the inn. The inn exudes a perfectly Sedona vibe with the Adobe Arizona feel, rich earth tones and south western textiles. Our honeymoon suite was upstairs, beautifully remodeled and stocked with a jet tub for two, a stone standing shower with 3 heads, a clean fridge, a toasty fireplace, the comfiest bed and a gorgeous terrace with seating for star gazing! We will be coming back every year and staying at the Casa Inn because I have absolutely no complaints and we left beyond satisfied!Very Nice Inn that is off the busy path. Great views of the Red Rocks and the highest rated restaurant in town downstairs. Wine Chiller, Fresh Cookies, Whirlpool in my room, 3 Shower Heads.... Staff was friendly and welcoming......Lots of Western Flavor and DecorAmazing! So welcoming and helpful. They will book outings for you, many times with a cheaper price than if you booked it yourself. We stayed in the Trail's End room and it was beautiful - jet two-person tub, fridge, and chocolate covered strawberries to greet us. Amazing breakfast each morning! We didn't even have to get lunch because they fed us so well!Came up from Scottsdale for just a night with my girlfriend and Golden Retriever dog to enjoy the beautiful scenic views of Sedona. It was a little tough finding a place that would accommodate us, but found this gem after numerous searching. They only use two of their rooms for friendly visitors bringing along a pet which is respectable. The room we had was very spacious and gave that Adobe Arizona feel that you want when staying up here. The surroundings are right up near Thunder Mountain trail and in prime location to some good Restaurants. It is a very quiet area where the specific bed &amp; breakfast is located that gives you that getaway atmosphere. I want to share with you the service. The service is by far one of the most important as it can make or break your stay. We called them and were very welcoming on the phone/ excited to meet out dog :). When we arrived, we were greeted right away and shown around as if we were going to buy the place, It made us feel special. Kim the owner and her staff did an excellent job of giving us a warm and pleasant welcoming during our stay that really put our mood in the right place from the start.  Lastly, the chef. We had read the reviews on the way up to our stay and they gave him justice. Excellent food preparation for our breakfast in the morning before our hike that got us even more jazzed up to enjoy the day. One of our best experiences away from home. If your looking for a Sedona getaway in the future you have to check this place out!!!This place is amazing.  If you want a quaint place to come home to after a long day of hiking, this is it.  The owner and the staff are great.  And the property is nice and updated.I would characterize this place as a high end B&amp;B.  There's a community kitchen with dishes, wine glasses, hot tea, and fresh baked cookies.  The jacuzzi in the back was used every night.  Not sure the condition of all the rooms but the renovated rooms are very nice.  Each room is different, so do your research.We stayed in the Navajo room which had a nice private deck, a large tub, a huge shower (with three shower heads!) and an oh so comfy bed.  If you are a light sleeper, you may want to choose a different room because this one is right above the kitchen, so you may be woken by some noise early in the morning.  It didn't bother us at all and we will choose this room again.We cancelled our fancy dinner plans one night and opted to have wine and cheese on our deck instead.  We spent every night star gazing from our deck.Then there's the restaurant.  The food is amazing!  The breakfast (included) each morning was not your traditional breakfast.  And dinner is also available but you need reservations.  Again, amazing!I like nice hotels, but I typically think of hotels as just a place to sleep.  This place really added to our overall experience.  We will definitely be back!My fiance and I had come up to Sedona on New Years to get married, but switched last minute from one of the large nationally known chain hotels to Casa Sedona. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Kim, the owner. The entry way was very inviting with a fire place, cozy chairs and leather sofa. As we were checking in we had noticed more and more snow coming down and started to get little concerned about road and site conditions for our wedding the very next day (Bell Rock).Without any hesitation, Kim had offered her facility to us free of charge and upgraded us to a room reserved for wedding couples.  This room is newly decorated with all of the comforts of home including a king bed, mini refrigerator, Jacuzzi tub and a shower built for 2.  The bedding and towels are the best quality you can get and the furniture and fixtures look to be hand selected. The mini refrigerator had chocolate covered strawberries for our arrival and she even brought a slice of cake up to our room after the wedding!The restaurant at Casa Sedona is very inviting and well decorated. You may choice a window seat or a table in front of the fireplace. All of the cups and dishes are customized. The first night we planned on going to a local restaurant, but became convinced after looking at the menu that we should stay in and eat dinner at Casa Sedona. The food was amazing and well beyond our expectation. I had the bison tenderloin and my wife had the chicken. Both meals were perfectly prepared and the service was excellent. The breakfast at Casa Sedona is included with the price of the room and went well beyond our expectation for a bed and breakfast. Both mornings we were served a full sit down breakfast with a very creative spin on eggs coupled with bacon, potatoes, French toast and warm croissants. In my opinion, Casa Sedona rivals any of the top restaurants in the area!There are many other details like the views from the rooms and the fresh baked cookies daily, but I want to personally thank Kim for letting us use her facility for our wedding service due to the snow storm. Our stay was absolutely amazing and we look forward to returning soon!I've lived in Sedona almost 9 years and only recently heard about this place. It's a Bed and Breakfast but open to the public on weekends. Outstanding restaurant! Great atmosphere and staff. The food was beautifully presented and delicious! I would definitely go back!This was my first stay at Casa Sedona - a unique boutique hotel- and it won't be my last!! The owner is very friendly and helpful and makes you feel like family. All of the staff I interacted with were just like her!! My room was clean and looked just like the pictures online. The bed and linens were simply amazing. Also I noted that of the six pillows on the bed, they were all different firmnesses- so you could find the perfect one for you. As a single woman traveler, I never worried about my safety here and the neighborhood that it's in is great for walking each morning. Lastly, the breakfast here is worth the entire room cost. It's served in 3 courses and both days it was delicious. I ate out on their beautiful patio my first morning and enjoyed the view and the quiet bubbling of their fountain.Amazing, simply amazing!  If you are a breakfast person like myself and my beloved, you must have breakfast here.  They serve a fixe price three course breakfast that is fresh, delicious and innovative in beautiful, beautiful surroundings!This boutique Hotel is the best. Our room was on the first floor that overlooked their beautiful serene garden. Kim was a perfect hostess and the gourmet breakfasts were exquisite and healthy. It was a perfect retreat to return to after a day of hiking and tourism. Our room had a private patio and was close to the hot tub. I was going to change our room at the last minute because the upstairs rooms are remodeled and I'm so happy I didn't. I loved our room and plan on booking the same room in the Spring next year or the Fall this year. Everything about this hotel my boyfriend and I loved. Our service at breakfast was extremely efficient as well as friendly and enjoyable. Please believe all the positive reviews because the negative one has not one ounce of honesty that I read or experienced. Kim runs a top notch resort and we have traveled all over the World. We visit Sedona twice a year and have stayed in other resorts. All of them were nice but now since staying at Casa Sedona there is no other place for us.Two stars based on the price. Nice refurbished room and very helpful staff. We had a room with a patio, but the furniture and atmosphere on the patio could have been much nicer. We found the previous guests old pizza in the refrigerator! Breakfast was very rushed and with zero choices: one berry smoothie and one ""main course"".We had such a wonderful stay.  The room was very comfortable, and Kim was so nice.  The free breakfast was the biggest surprise.  It was just fantastic.  The restaurants that Kim suggested were all terrific as well.  I would love to come back for another visit.That's was our first time at the Casa Sedona and we had a wonderful stay. The rooms were comfortable and updated. The property had a zen like atmosphere, and the breakfast and coffee was equally great. If I could give the host Kim 10 stars who runs the property I would! This will be a repeat visit for my wife and I on a regular basis. Thank you.Great location, quiet street off Hwy 89A. Easy access to activities in Sedona. Robin was an excellent host, providing a tour on arrival and was truly at our service. Beds and linens A++++! We loved the Sunset room on the first floor with a fireplace, king bed, and 2 person spa tub. 2-course Breakfast was excellent, a much better quality than we could have imagined. On our next trip, we won't be looking anywhere else. Thanks Casa Sedona Inn!!! -Preston &amp; AshleyThis review is for dining only as we did not stay there.  My BF and I went for dinner while vacationing in Sedona, based on reviews made on Trip Advisor.  We were NOT disappointed!  We were seated promptly in the dining room, which had nice, dim lighting and soft music playing.  There was a table of six loud people next to us, which made it hard to hear ourselves speaking, but thankfully they were finishing up as we sat down, and the rest of the evening was quiet and romantic.  It is BYOB, which we knew ahead of time, and I don't mind at all.  I had the seafood risotto and my BF had the salmon and our entrees were delicious.  Amazing.  So good that we contemplated calling and asking if they had room for us the next night too:)  The grounds are super cute and we would totally stay here as guests the next time we're in Sedona after seeing it.  I think the one one star review lady is most likely insane.  Go there!  You'll love it.We spent two nights at Casa Sedona, great location, super nice &amp; friendly staff, very helpful with planning hikes and other things on the must do list. The grounds are beautiful, the common area w/ coffee, tea &amp; cookies is a very nice amenity. We stayed in the Garden Pueblo room, it had a very nice private entry &amp; deck outside. The bed was comfy and the room was clean, could use a bit of updating, mainly the carpet.  If in the area we would stay again.The Sedona hillside location is nature up close with private &amp; customized decor in each room. A beautifully designed building, with plants and art objects adding around everywhere to add an upscale tranquility for just being on the property. Breakfast out side on the patio each morning is uniquely different and delicious. Worth every $285/night dollar.Good, but not great.  Hotels in Sedona are generally quite expensive, and at around $200/nightly this one feel in the mid-range of what was available.  However after having been to this town and seen the gorgeous views available from EVERYWHERE (i.e., the grocery store parking lot, the side of every road, and - I'm imagining - many rooms of the local Super 8 Motel) location is less of a concern for next time.  The included free wifi and decent (again, not great) breakfast were plusses.  Downsides include surprisingly uncomfortable pillows, lots of noise from the breakfast area downstairs starting at 6:30 AM(!!), and a subtly clashing color scheme in the room of dark red, silver, orange red, and pink carpet.So, in short, unless you are dead-set on a B&amp;B OR can splurge and go for the REALLY luxurious top-end places, I personally would recommend you save your money and go for one of the cheap places in town.  It's not like you're going to be spending a lot of time in your room while you're here - Sedona is one of the most astonishingly beautifully placed cities I have ever been to (and I've been to a lot of amazing places around the world).We booked the Moondance room.   The bed was comfortable and the terrace access on cool April mornings was very nice.   The two course breakfasts were well-prepared, and dining in the shadow of Thunder Mountain on the peaceful patio was an awesome way to start a day of hiking and sightseeing. Robin was our main contact, and she was extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay.   She recommended Barking Frog and Heartline restaurants, and we thoroughly enjoyed both.  We'll be back.",,,,,"['across', 'board', 'best', 'boutique', 'hotel', 'ever', 'enchanting', 'inn', 'perched', 'thunder', 'mountain', 'power', 'wow', 'simultaneously', 'making', 'feel', 'much', 'home',

Location is ideal and the view of bell rock is unreal. I love this place. Friendly staff too!THINK TWICE.  Or at least don't expect these guys to take the high road.  There was a <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a> booking error, that confirmed an unintended reservation to an old email.  I asked the manager, John, if he could reverse it since I never stayed there.  He said someone else even used ""my"" room, named Nina, and collected rent from her too.  He still took my money.  The spiritual nature of Sedona doesn't extend everywhere.I'll start off with the things I wasn't too impressed with. The room did come with a microwave and fridge, however the microwave was hidden behind a bedside table on the floor. There was also bits of cacti in the mattress cover, which fortunately didn't hurt anyone in the room but was still not exactly what I was looking for in a room. Overall the room was just bland and wearisome of its exact cleanliness. but BONUS free wifi. (only thing being that most rooms aren't in range of the modem)But the staff was very friendly and everything worked as it was supposed to and the rooms came at a super good deal. So if you're looking for something easy, cheap and slightly out of the middle of Sedona, the Sedona Village Inn willmost likely fit your needs!Spent two nights here. Basic but more than adequate.The room was clean and had the fundamentals I needed: bed was neat, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was also clean and had fresh towels. The room also had a microwave and small refrigerator. The office was no-frills and unassuming. It wasn't even that easy to find as it is located on the second floor in the middle of the building. Check-in was easy, but I was amused that my reservation was noted on a Post-It sticky note on the desk rather than in a computer system or something. And check-out was simply leaving the key in the room when you leave.The only issues I had with the room was that the floor was not carpeted and was cold tile - which was clean and well-kept, but it made the room have a much colder feel to it. Also, the wi-fi didn't really work. I think I managed to connect to it once, but it was so slow that it wasn't worth it.Aside from those issues, though, this is a decent, very affordable place to stay when all you need is a bed, shower and toilet. And for me, that was all I needed.Awesome place! Everyone I've come in contact with had excellent customer service, they always greeted you with a smile &amp; try their best to make your stay pleasant. It's very generously priced &amp; you get some great views of Bell Rock. Their furniture is very groovy too ;). It's close to pretty much anywhere you need to go. I would definitely recommend this hotel!Very dog friendly. It was decent for the price and location. The pizza place in the same parking lot is amazing! If you are looking for a fancy hotel keep looking; this is strictly for functionality.I stayed here while my street was being paved.  The owner was very nice and friendly, and gave me a local discount.  My room had free wi-fi and a small fridge which was all I needed.  The room is in a quiet area  and I was able to rest well.  I now recommend this place to friends and family alike.We stay here every time we are going to Sedona. Very basic, very inexpensive, nice staff, pet friendly. 5 stars based on budget no star hotel. Walking distance to great morning coffee at the Bike and Bean and great Chinese food next door at Red Chopsticks.This is a low budget hotel.  Lowwww budget.  I don't think a room can be found in the seediest 'hood for what they charge.  The 5 stars is in relation to the budget hotel category.  I've pd. Much more for a lot worse. There are no frills, no ice makers, (but there is a plastic ice tray in the freezer /fridge provided) no food, no pool, or 24 hour desk.It is sparsely furnished and dated for sure.  We got the 49$ king room which was clean.  I've no complaints about the cleanliness of the room.  Right outside of our window was the garbage area to the Chinese restaurant next door.  Ew.  We didn't eat there.  The door lock was damaged, but, worked, kinda.  We went just before July 4th weekend, everyone else had raised their prices, and the other budget motels didn't look much better.  The air conditioner in the room was ice cold, yay! It was pretty hot, so that negated the mediocrity of the place for us.  Besides, there's way too much to see and do in Sedona to be hanging around in a hotel room anyway.It serves its purpose of short stay/place to sleep.  The money saved with this hotel can go towards a meal at one of the great restaurants in town.Oh yea...the free wi-if doesn't friggin work either...lol(Credit to jmg for pointing out the typos)Great place for the money. Several restaurants within walking distance. Our room was clean and the staff was very helpful. Glad we stayed here, Sedona is a beautiful town.Pleasantly surprised when we walked into our room. My wife and I and our dog were on an Arizona roadtrip. We'd just came from Flagstaff, where we paid double the rates of Sedona Village Lodge for a questionable motel room. First off, our dog stayed here free. No pet fees! Free! The room we stayed in at Sedona Village Lodge was huge! Featured a living room area, kitchenette, separate bedroom with King bed... and a fireplace! Wow! We'll definitely come back!2 words. BED BUGS. and as soon as I left, the next morning my bank called me and told me there was $300 fraud on my card...Spacious Cheap Motel in a very expensive area. My Dog and I  (Buddy) were very lucky to find this place and we tell others about it.We stayed here for 2 weeks while doing business in the area.We were offered towel and maid service every day and sheets too! The Central air worked great and we were very comfortable.Low key little motel. Sedona Village Lodge only merits 2 stars on its own, but because it offers an incredible view of the rock formations and the trails are only a few minutes walk away and because a double is only 50 bucks, I give this motel 3 stars.  The motel is in a mall that includes a couple of rather uninteresting dining options, but its right off Highway  179 and its a great starting point for some serious hiking.Great choice for the budget minded traveler who just wants a place convenient to some good hiking trails.This motel gets two stars... One for the gorgeous view from room #16 and the other for the beautiful layout of that room... a suite... which was spacious and comfortable.  I stayed in both the suite and a downstairs room and there is a huge difference in quality, view and comfort.Here the thing with this motel... It is the least expensive price you are going to get in Sedona/Village of Oak Creek, and if you mention anything wrong, they be sure to let you know that it is the least expensive room in the area and they say that you should feel lucky that you are getting such a rate.So here's my story...I stayed here while waiting for my apartment to be ready to move into... 3 weeks... The first week in the suite, the second in the downstairs dungeon, and the third back in the suite.I was able to ignore that 4 out of 4 bulbs in the overhead light were out, and that my garbage hadn't been picked up for a few days, but half way through my 2nd week, my dog got heat stroke.  I was in a serious panic.  My cell had stopped working and I couldn't call a clinic.  I called the front desk and asked him to connect me with the clinic which he did.  The clinic told me to take the dog's temp and if it's over 102.5 to call back.  Well, I didn't have a thermometer, but I knew that the young man at the desk had a young child and that he could probably help me out.Well.... if he hadn't closed up the office.  So my dog is shaking and looks terrible and this gentleman at the desk closes up without checking in with me, even though he knows there is a somewhat serious situation going on.And the difference of a few degrees could mean life or death, but I had no way of knowing, and didn't want to leave my dog alone and didn't want to take him with me in the 90+ degree heat.So I sat out the night with my dog and he was ok. But it was quite a trying experience.The next morning I told the owner (the young man's father) that I thought it was a poor choice that the evening desk man left without checking in on me.At that point the father/owner starts YELLING at me saying my dog barked for 2 hours while I was out and that his son was totally ok for leaving because I didn't ask him to stay in this EMERGENCY situation.First of all, I had no idea that my dog had been barking.  I have left him alone hundreds of times, including in a house with 3 other roommates, and he has never made a peep.  Something/someone probably set him off.  And they didn't have my cell to call me, because I could have been back in 5 minutes to take care of the dog.  Still, I take responsibility for my dog and let the whole thing with the son slide.  Again, i was reminded I am paying the cheapest prices in Sedona.  The young man/son of the owner was nice to me the next few times I saw him.Well, a few days later (once I moved back upstairs to the suite) I walked by the office and ducked my head in to ask a question.  It was that same young man, and he was busy with his kid and so I said I would come back a little later.  I got to my room and realized I forgot my key and went back to the office where the drapes had been hastily closed and the office door locked.  It was 8:30 at night and they close the office at 9pm (as I learned the week before) and so I knew I was justified in knocking (and I needed to get into my room).  I litterally knocked for 5 minutes and eventually the door opened about 3 inches and a key was THROWN at me, and then the door slammed shut.Well, at least I could get back in my roomWhen I told the woman at the front desk the next day, she seemed completely unfazed by it, again, there was no apology and I was (again) reminded that I am paying the cheapest rates in Sedona.If the incident with the doorkey had not happened, I could have forgiven the incident with my dog.  But this was getting absurd, so i asked if I could leave that day. I was on a weekly rate and had 3 days left and the woman said I didn't give them enough notice and that I would have to stay.Well... OK.  But I'm going to yelp about it!  So here I am.Thank you for reading my rant.  It's a shame that the desk is so hostile because that suite and the view from the suite was gorgeous.  And internet worked really well in the suite. (So so in the downstairs dungeon.)I would say that it would be worth paying a little more to be treated better and have more responsible and kind interactions with the front desk.  But I also can't stay that I wouldn't stay there again... I just know not to rely on anyone and that I'm putting my money there because of the view and the suite.  The Wildflower Inn is next door and they have the same great view.  The Quality Inn is next to the strip mall that Village Lodge is in  and they have a pool and breakfast for just a little more.Finally, if you have pets, i would say that the Village Lodge allows pets but it not ""pet friendly"".  Like, they are pretty hostile toward animals even though they allow pets to stay .Had a great time here last time my girlfriend and I were in Sedona. We didn't want to pay the high prices that the other Sedona hotels offer and we found this place. Nice and tucked away from the hustle and bustle of uptown and its close to trails including our favorite Bell Rock. We will definitely be staying here again. Thanks!My problems began with the reservations.  I had made them earlier in the week by phone, but when I arrived at the motel the front desk person was already in the midst of confusion, repeatedly going though a number of post-it notes to verify the reservation information for the four patient people ahead of me. He was polite but obviously flustered about names, dates, number of rooms, length of stay, and even whether rooms were ready or not (he sent one group to a room that turned out to be dirty).When he got to me, he only had reservations for Saturday night; none of his post-it notes or calendar scribbles noted my Friday night reservation, though he claimed to recall our phone conversation. What to do? It's Sedona so hotel spaces are hard to find.  I was headachy and tired after driving in from Nevada and was glad that he did the professional thing by giving me the only room available for the same price I had originally reserved: a ""suite"" (kitchenette, kiva-style (gas) fireplace, and mini livingroom.  I didn't care - I just needed a room.  Unfortunately, I would need to change rooms the next day, which was very inconvenient as I had plans to be out all day sightseeing with a friend who'd made tour reservations.There is no food on the premises, nor any ice or vending machines, so I got carry-out from the Chinese restaurant within the same plaza, ate that and tried to rest before going to bed.  The spiderwebs added to my discomfort. It only takes a broom to clean them away, right?  I re-thought my plans to stay there a second night. When I called their service number I got voicemail telling me to leave a message and they'd call back. For an emergency I could call their home number, but I didn't consider this an emergency so I left a voice mail around 6:30 pm letting them know what I was unhappy about (no one called back).Later when I retired to the bed area I regretted not calling the home number.  There was dirt- crumbs, etc. on the floor between the beds.  Spiderwebs on the ceiling, and - worst of all- HAIR all over the sheet! The peelable stain added even more to my revulsion.  By now it was after going on 9:30 pm but I left a second voicemail, this time voicing my disgust.  Despite wanting to flee I checked the other bed and the sheet was hairless so after a long internal debate I tried to lie down and forget the conditions. Then I reached over to the radio  and got my fingers covered with some kind of sticky half-dried substance. Well, that was it!  I called the home number and spoke to a woman to whom I described the nasty conditions of the bed and floor, and my displeasure with their reservation system which would require me to have to change rooms.  The woman had no sympathy for me.  Hair on the sheets? Sleep in the other bed.  Messy room? Housekeeping is closed for the day.  Discount? Well, ""we get complaints from people but we never give discounts"" (yes, that's a quote).   Since I was now angry but powerless, I kept up the complaining just to see if I could at least get an apology for the crappy experience. She finally offered one, but only after telling me, ""you should be happy. You already got a $30 discount because we put you in a suite.""  Yeah, a suite I have to move from the next day because of your crappy reservation system. A room containing dirt and hair from any number of previous guests, old spider webs and who-knows-what-else. Thanks for the upgrade.The only reason I stayed the second night was because I refused to ruin my friend's day by spending it looking for another hotel. In addition, I was driving across country starting early the next morning and needed all the rest I could get.  When I went to the office Saturday morning I received a key for the new room from the man (owner?) on duty and was permitted to leave my belongings in the ""suite,"" so they could move everything themselves. That was a professional thing for them to do, so I am acknowledging it.  However, he made sure to add insult to injury by announcing that the new room had a terrible view and ""barely enough room to walk around the bed."" When I saw the second room late that night I was dismayed again.  Housekeeping is clearly not important to these people. I can forgive the bugs all over the halls since they leave the doors open during the day, but the rooms themselves should be free of old spiderwebs.  The bathroom wall and ceiling had months worth of black fuzzy stuff from a filthy ceiling exhaust fan.  How much work does it take to sweep a broom across a fan, wall and ceiling?  Why would you make  your customers sleep in conditions you wouldn't make your own family live in- and take money for it besides?I can understand people having a bad day (like, perhaps, the front desk clerk) but overall, the problems appear to be systemic.  Needless to say I will not be staying there again, $59 or not! I have posted pictures of some of the things I've complained about.I was pretty impressed with this place for the price. Clean, spacious room, comfy bed, easy to find, very nice staff (granted we didn't interact with them much).

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sedona-bear-lodge-sedona,Sedona Bear Lodge,5.0,$$,19,"I am not even quite sure how to begin this. Do I talk about the room? the food? the hosts? because all three were simply amazing.My wife and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary by taking a trip to Las Vegas and Sedona.While in Sedona, we chose the Bear Lodge based off reviews and room photos. Neither did this place true justice.We stayed in the upstairs private room called the Indian Garden.   When we arrived in Sedona , it was in the middle of a cold snap and was 19 degrees outside. I was concerned that we might be cold in the room, but I was wrong. It was very very warm and toasty and there were no drafts. We would have never been able to tell it was that cold out side.The room had a private bathroom and balcony as well.  The balcony served us greatly as I am an avid Star watcher and we arrived in the middle of the Leonid meteor showers. It was a wonder to see the shooting stars from the privacy of our balcony.We were very impressed by the comfort of the bed and the cleanliness of the room and bathroom.The public area had a massage chair that my wife got a lot of use out of and Myles and Masumi were gracious enough to get the hot tub that is out side cranked up so we could use it.  We used it everynight.  Nothing better than being in a hot tub when its that cold.  Looking up from the hot tub offered us great views of the open sky and stars.  We even saw the International Space Station transit overhead. What a delight.Next the food.Words can not describe the food. I can't even find the right ones to describe how good the food was. The four breakfasts we had wereBreakfast KebabsBreakfast Burrito (If you plan on going on hike the day you get a breakfast burrito, make sure to ask for some foil. Take half the burrito on the hike. You will thank me later)Loco MocoBlueberry PancakesMyles and Masumi made everything there and boy do their efforts work out in your best interest.   I have been to a lot of breakfast and brunch places and never. NEVER. have I had such wonderful food.The Loco Moco is a traditional breakfast from Hawaii. I have never experianced it before , I am glad I did.  It was the best thing I have ever eaten.All the breakfasts come with a little fresh fruit sorbet / glacee dish. I can not impress that this is the place to say if you love food.  We ate dinner out every night in Sedona and would definately say that If Myles and Masumi opened up a full service resturant. It would instantly be the best thing in town. Finally the Hosts.Myles and Masumi are so wonderful and gracious. They made sure that our needs were met and that we had all the information needed about the local sites and sights so that we didn't miss anything that we should not.     We have been to some bed and breakfasts where I was kind of put off by the hosts, but These two I could have sat and listened to their stories for hours. Their wealth of knowledge of the area and graciousness made a wonderful stay for us.Stay at the Sedona Bear Lodge when in town. You won't be disappointed.beautiful place! we stayed in the Hacienda Room. the bed was amazing and huge! very warm, tons of extra blankets, beautiful decor. warm and quiet too. Myles and Masumi were so hospitable. the breakfast was delicious! super simple and filling. the best breakfast we've had at a hotel or b&amp;b. this was home cooked in their kitchen by Myles himself. we loved the small treats too!the whole property radiates positive energy. we were able to spend some time on the outside porch. loved the wind chimes. the lodge is tucked away in a cute quiet neighborhood and is surrounded by juniper trees. overall, a wonderful stay.. we will definitely be staying there again the next time we're in Sedona!I can't believe I forgot to rate this place!!!!!This place was amazing, awesome, perfect... The Sedona Bear Lodge is tucked a way a little bit from downtown (or uptown I forget) Sedona. You simply can not find a place that gives you as much bang for the buck as this place. Seriously... Try and find a less expensive place that comes even close to here!The couple (Myles and Masumi) and their dog (Meeko) are extremely welcoming and make your visit to Sedona perfect! They will make you the most incredible breakfasts and tell you anything and everything you need to know about Sedona. We stayed two nights in the Indian Garden room and it was great. We spoke so highly of this place to friends that another couple stayed here when they came to visit. Review Basics... - Super great service - Super inexpensive considering Sedona prices - Excellent breakfasts included - Would absolutely stay there next time we go to SedonaWhat all the other reviews say are fact - this place is truly special. Why? Here's why:1) Gourmet home-cooked breakfasts perfectly portioned2) Cozy rooms, large bathrooms3) Reasonable rates (very reasonable for Sedona)4) Conveniently located to the major hiking spots and town areas5) Cute friendly dog!Above all, the hosts Masumi and Myles are truly wonderful. My fiance and I felt like they were family. Needless to say, we'll be returning soon, if anything to try out one of their other rooms.Awesome experience.  The rooms  are reasonably priced the breakfast was way beyond our expectations.  Nice cozy location.  Highly recommended.  The owners are cool they treat and talk to you like family.  If u have a chance to stay here don't miss that chance because it will be a cool experienceWe had the most wonderful stay at the Sedona Bear Lodge. Unlike other B&amp;B experiences, we got to know Myles and Masumi, proprietors, who treated us like we were so welcome in their home. Typically, a B&amp;B experience is just about the breakfast. But, at the Sedona Bear Lodge, Myles and Masumi were warm, friendly, and gave us discount cards to local restaurants. Myles even invited us to a free concert by famed flutist Jesse Kalu. What a special treat! Our rooms were ideal as we got a master to ourselves and were provided with a separate room for our two children. Downstairs we spent many hours in the shared living room, getting a massage on the public chair, and playing with the family's dog, Meeko. Sedona Bear Lodge is one place we hope to get back to soon!I found this great B&amp;B from Tripadvisor which currently shows it with a 5 star rating from 98 reviewers.  If you are like me and you'd want to obsess over every review prior to parting with your precious money, you might want to check out that website for more details.Why I love Sedona Bear Lodge:1. Hospitality/Customer service: Example: Masumi and Myles packed a delicious on the go breakfast for us when we had to wake up very early for our drive to the Grand Canyon.  I know they even did this for a guest that was leaving at 2am! 2. Cleanliness: Our room was spotless. Linens and towels were cleaned everyday.3. Breakfast: It's been mentioned by many other reviewers before but it really is going to be one of the best you'll have.  I thought it was better than some restaurants I've had breakfast at and coming from a great food city, I tend to be a bit food snobby.4. Large and clean private bathrooms, good water pressure and good water temperature.  Not many people mention this but after a long day of hiking or walking around exploring, you want to go back and have a good shower, or at Sedona Bear Lodge - a great one.5. Location: The Sedona Bear Lodge is very close to downtown but it is actually in a residential neighborhood which makes it very quiet and peaceful.Love love love this B&amp;B!!! We had an awesome time! The couple who run it (Masumi and Myles) are simply incredible! Food was AMAZING!!!!!! We will be back next time we visit Sedona!!!!This is the best accommodation I've ever paid for, and it's worth every precious cent.I may still be in my late twenties, but I used to travel a lot for work (i.e. Marriott Platinum status) and so I have developed precise evaluation criteria whenever I had to stay at places on my own dime.Here are the top 5 reasons that you should stay here:1. FOOD. Resounding another review below (or above, I don't know how the ordering works), You're losing money by not staying here! Sedona is a touristy and expensive place for food. Breakfast easily exceeds $10 per person and at Bear Lodge you'll get the best breakfast there is. Our breakfast was a really fancy and beautiful breakfast burrito, homemade cucumber and papaya muffin (amazing), homemade pear sorbet (a-freaking-mazing), fruit dishes, homemade cookies, etc. I just drooled on my keyboard.2. MEMORIES. The owners (Masumi and Myles) are an absolutely wonderful people who place your experience at the top. Not only do they provide the materials for you to create the souvenir, they also keep the memories of every guest they've had. A whole lot of fun toys you can use here too-- multiple telescope for viewing the moon and the stars, books, massage chair, hammock in the back, swings, etc.3. BEST BATHROOM. It's super clean, spacious, and they provide everything for you. It feels like staying at a Category 4 or 5 hotel in Marriott terms (out of 7, and 7 is a Ritz-Carlton). It's the best thing you can ask for after a fruitful day of hiking one of the many beautiful Sedona trails.4. BEST GUIDES. The owners really have the love for Sedona and its energy; they really position you right with the peacefulness that you should be experiencing here. Aside from giving you the best tips on sunset, hiking, photos, and food, they also have a delegated fridge to hold all the water bottles you can take for your hikes.5. PEACE. If you're staying at one of the hotels or complexes, you should expect exposure to some absurdity of the youngsters running around at night, dogs barking, or plain drunk people. Light pollution is kind of a problem if you're around downtown too. At Bear Lodge, it's completely silent at night and dark (as in... you literally can't go walking around at night without your own lights). Absolutely beautiful.You'll absolutely love it.Look, this is a different way to view Sedona...The right way!  Miles and Matsumi (the owners of the lodge) make you feel like one of the family. The prices are fair and they have all the info you need about the area, where to eat, what to see, and great hiking trails.    Breakfast was Awsome! The room was clean . This is a great way to stay in Sedona if you are looking to get away from the hotel feel, and want to feel more like you are staying with family.The reviews Don't lie!!! The hosts of Sedona Bear Lodge are the best. I felt so welcome and at home during my stay. Myles, Masumi and Meeko were the nicest and showed great hospitality. I enjoyed talking to them during delicious morning breakfasts and also coming home from a weary day. They gave great recommendations to see Sedona and wonderful insight to what Sedona is all about.  They made us feel like we were their own family. I now consider them as friends, even after a short stay! :)We stayed in the Indian Garden room. It was nice, clean, and cozy. It also had a balcony with a telescope. But we didn't have to use the telescope to see the bright beautiful stars. I'd recommend this place to anyone and will stay there again in the near future.If you have been exhausted by your daily life, you must visit Sedona and stay at Sedona Bear Lodge.  Masumi &amp; Myles (Owner) will treat you like their family. We have stayed Sedona Bear Lodge twice already.  When we visited Sedona this February, we hiked Boyton Canyon which Masumi recommended the most.  It took us 1.5 hours to arrive to the top but it does worth it!!!   We enjoyed amazing view of Mother Nature.  It was absolutely one of our best hikes ever. On that night we soaked in the Jacuzzi &amp; looking at stars.  I am surprised stars in Sedona's sky are big and bright!  We enjoyed our quiet time and it was so relaxing. (Don't forget to try a massage chair in their living room) Next morning, it's time for famous breakfast made by Masumi &amp; Myles. Masumi bakes homemade bread every morning and Myles prepares the breakfast. I love their breakfast burrito; it's so delicious    Breakfast menu changes everyday so you never get bored. If you love bear, you should check Masumi's bear collection.  She has a great selection of Smokey Bear and other bears.  You can purchase Masumi's original Sedona bear or other staffs for souvenir. Too many things to tell you about this B&amp;B. Well, seeing is believing.  Pack your staff and visit Sedona Bear Lodge next weekend!Myles and Masumi are the BEST!!!!!  Cannot laud their property, accommodations, food, and service enough.  They bend over backwards for all of their guests and are the heighth of friendliness.  We forgot our hiking sticks at home . . . guess what--they had two to loan us!  As well as binoculars, canes, meditation mats, pretty much anything you might need they have available.  Need guidance/advice on something to do?  They have a mountain of information/fliers/maps and personal experience ready and available for you.  The location is in a very, very quiet and relaxing area--slept like babies!  Rooms were extremely well-decorated and very comfortable.  We cannot give them a higher rating, and will definitely be availing ourselves of their services the next time we're in Sedona!Where do I have to start about this place? First, let's start with the tenants, Matsumi and Myles. They both made my fiancee (Laura) and my stay the best it could possibly be. The way they relate to you and allow you to become family changes the entire way you will look at lodging. Talking to them throughout our stay they were beyond helpful in offering advice on where to go and what to do. They have many books and pamphlets about what to do in the area, and despite the fact that they are still new to the area; they went out of their way to make sure we were treated supremely well.  As for this cozy house, it simply engulfs you in its aura, and it feels like you do not want to leave. Walking in immediately, you will see the dining area, where your amazing breakfasts will start (I'll discuss later). You will also see to your left pristine living room with a comfy massage chair among large snug couches ready for you to be enveloped in.  The outside has a large Jacuzzi; however it was a bit too chilly to use it just yet. The outdoor porch is amazing and welcoming, especially with the views it provided us when we sat outside. We were allowed to tour the entire house and see each room. Each room is well worth the price levels they put on their website. Among options for rooms you have the Indian Garden, good for a lone visitor, or for a family trip you may want to opt for the Ponderosa/Bunk House, large enough for the whole family. We opted for the middle option, the Hacienda Room, which had everything a couple could need for a weekend trip.Finally, the food.....My goodness. Each night before you retire they will ask when you want your food made, and it was spot on timing from their end. First morning, we had breakfast burritos with salsa. Sounds simple right? No, no, you're mistaken. These burritos were handcrafted by Myles and Masumi, and came with a build your own fruit, granola and yogurt area. Along with this comes a carafe of fresh OJ and fresh coffee all made as you wake up. Finally, there is a frozen twist! Myles makes this frozen fruit smoothie, each morning a different type. The next morning, we were provided an outstanding chopped ham and cheese dish which was partnered with a sunny side up egg atop 6 separate sauteed veggies. Once again, same yogurt bar and a different frozen fruit smoothie. They will hang around with you, opting to make wonderful morning conversation and gather what you did the night before and what is to await you that next day. This may very well occur the night before as well, if you aren't exhausted from your travels that day. They have a quick-boil pot which will allow for a quick cup of relaxing tea for yourself. Heck, they are always around and ready to put on a spot of tea for you, or help you. That's what makes them so great. At the end, we truly didn't want to leave, but we were told that this was now our own ""home away from home"", and that we ""must stop by so we can see you next time you're in town"".  We truly won't forget this spot. They've earned customers for life, and we will always make sure that when we stay in Sedona, we stay at the Sedona Bear Lodge. If you see this, let them know Jeff and Laura sent you....It will put a smile on their faces.-JeffReally nice! Friendly staff ! Great area also! A cool town to to in! Prices are good tooI loved staying here! The owners of the B&amp;B were so inviting and welcoming. My fiance and I talked with them for several hours and it immediately felt like we had known them for years. The room that we stayed in was adorable and quaint. We were able to sneak a peek at the other rooms and they are just as nice if not nicer than the one we stayed in. Miles and Matsumi never hesitated to offer use something to drink and always had snacks out for us to munch on and take with us on our journey. They even made us breakfast. I thought it would be a continental style where we just help ourselves to bagels and muffins. Nope! A warm, cooked meal. Reviewing it is making me want to go back now!We only stayed one night but we are looking forward to going back for a longer stay. Super nice folks; Masumi amd Myles. They accommodated our early check-in request. They checked with us on any diet restrictions and followed through on those the next morning at breakfast. Room was great. Grounds are great. Price is great. Beautiful area. They took pictures and sent to us when we checked out; a nice touch. Breakfast and all the snacks and beverages were great.Lovely B&amp;B,nice owners, amazing balcony copious shelf space.  Moon was awesome, there is a telescope on the balconyWe had a great time staying with Myles and Masumi at Sedona Bear Lodge. We stayed in the Hacienda Room. It was perfect. Super comfortable king sized bed, luxurious sheets, down pillows. It was very private and quiet.  Myles and Masumi make delicious, gourmet breakfasts. They are the perfect mix of attentive while also giving you your space. They had tons of suggestions and guides of things to do while in Sedona. Basically, stay here. It is the best bang for your buck. We will definitely be back.",,,,,"['quite', 'sure', 'begin', 'talk', 'room', 'food', 'hosts', 'three', 'simply', 'amazing', 'wife', 'celebrating', 'year', 'anniversary', 'taking', 'trip', 'las',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/kings-ransom-inn-sedona,Kings Ransom Inn,2.0,$$,16,"I recently stayed here for while in town for a wedding--I was looking for an affordable place  that was not only convenient, but nice enough to really feel like I was on vacation. Overall, I was fairly disappointed. Not to say the hotel didn't have it's perks. Location-wise, King's Ransom was great. It was right in the middle of town and the view was decent.  Breakfast wasn't bad either. It was a bit cold to spend time outside when I visited in December, but the hotel grounds did have a few nice areas to spend time in warmer weather.For about $100 a night,though, even in an expensive town like Sedona, I expect a lot more from a hotel.  I should really say ""motel"" since you access the rooms from outside.  The room was also pretty dingy, complete with worn bedspreads made popular by places like Motel 6. And even though the room was (too) dim, there were a lot of obvious carpet stains.There was also a problem with the TV in the room. We had a technician come to look at it, but he was stumped. We told him to forget about it since we weren't spending much time in the room. But that didn't stop a different maintenance guy from showing up at 7am the next day. So much for sleeping in. We told him not to worry about it either, but he showed up again while we were getting ready. Just to avoid another unexpected visit, we let him in. Turns out the cable was broken. And when I say broken, I mean the cord itself was severed. I'm not sure how this stumped the first guy. Next time I go to Sedona, I'll just plan on footing the bill for something nicer or pay half the price for an actual motel/ Why pay $100 for a run down ""inn"" when there are so many other options?Only stayed one night. The room was just fine. The front desk service was sort of strange...like they have never checked anyone in before. No elevator to help lift your stuff to the second floor. We had a cooler of ice and drinks since it was over 100 degrees. The pool was fine. We missed the free breakfast. It is right at the bottom of a lovely hike. Don't miss the hike...it's the best part about this location.What a disappointment. The only thing positive I can mention is that the staff listened to my concern and acted accordingly. After checking in, and finding a parking place, we made the long walk down a musty hallway to a dark, dank and depressing room. Stained carpet and the smell of mildew instantly turned my stomach. The entire place needs a serious make-over! The furniture is old and ugly, the sheets have lost their crispness, and the AC is loud! And what hotel feels justified charging $135 a night with an only 24"" tube TV? Smelly, ugly and overpriced! Sorry guys, you were great at the front desk, but your Inn is OU!great place to use as a ""base camp"" for hiking Sedona.  Central to Cathedral, Bell Rock, etc.  Elote Cafe is on the premises.  Staff was accommodating.  The free breakfast has lots of offerings for hikers: hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, yogurt, cereals, sweet rolls and make-your-own waffles.  Room was clean and housekeeping cleaned quickly after we left the room.  Having a view from the room was a great treat.This place worked great for us during our trip to Sedona!  We ended up getting a great room for pretty cheap in Sedona standards (around $115 before tax).  The ladies at the front desk were friendly and accomodating.  They let us look at the rooms before deciding to stay there.  We looked at three rooms.  The one we got was clean and roomy, but there was one that smelled like smoke, and one that was pretty cramped.  Not all of the rooms are the same.  Some have flat screened tvs, some don't, but they have all the necessities.  They even have an awesome pool and hot tub that was connected right to our sliding door.All in all, this fit my standards.  They were even economical using soap and shampoo dispensors to avoid going through a lot of those tiny bottles and bars of soap. They are also located right next to what is supposed to be the greatest mexican restaurant in town.Ok so this is not Kings Ransom Hotel that is just across the parking lot. But this place was affordable &amp; had the pool that guests over at Kings Ransom Hotel come over to use. They share facilities apperently like the gym over at the hotel, Inn guests can use it. So it had all that I needed. A bed and a shower. Breakfast is provided but not much of a selection. Awesome do it yourself waffle maker though. I had the breakfast the first morning but opted to something else the next. Nice staff but they tend to walk out for a smoke very often. Downside was that the pool are closes at 10pm. I came back after a day of hiking wanting to soak longer in the spa for my aching muscles. The watchdog at night that came out for a smoke kicked us out. The room had outdated carpet, shower was not strong enough, odd that the sink is outside of the bathroom and AC was SUPER loud. Kept me up the first night trying to get used to. Oh and the walls are thin so in the morning I could hear everyone.Based on the pictures and online ratings I thought I was booking a decent room at a nice establishment.   Not so much,  the room was nothing like the advertised picture, no refrigerator and an old Zenith TV not anything like the flat screen in the picture online.  It smelled bad, very musty and not very clean.  The sheets were stained and furniture very old and beat up.  It smelled so bad we couldn't even sleep the whole night through!!  King Ransom Inn,  if your going to charge the same rates as your competition in Sedona, AZ you could at least do some renovation and give your guests the experience they paid for!!!  Very disappointed!!This hotel is not worth the money. The room are NOT worth the amount they charge. I am currently disputing a credit card charge from them that was made ONE MONTH AFTER I stayed there.Not as crappy as the quasi-attached Kings Ransom Sedona Hotel, but still pretty crappy.Filthy carpet, years worth of dust on the draperies and in every corner, and the toiletries are super-lousy supposedly-green versions that you pump out of wall-mounted bulk dispensers. Vacuums are apparently not an amenity afforded the housekeeping staff. (And actually, come to think of it, I never heard one running when I was present for housekeeping time.)The night receptionist was rude, the day receptionist was disinterested.I apparently lucked out in my room, as I had enough pillows for my bed, unstained linens, and an air conditioner with a thermostat. The WiFi was  non-functional, but Comfort Inn's is helpfully unsecured. My travel companions and my hotel neighbors were not so lucky.The ""free expanded continental breakfast"" isn't worth the price paid, pays no heed to hygiene or food safety, and has the audacity to proffer a tip jar but no breakfast attendant or restocking. The ""expanded"" is waffle batter, of which only an allotted number of pre-measured cups are provided. By the time you get to them, they'll already have skinned over or congealed. Whoop-de-effing-doo. And, BTW, waffles apparently do not imply the availability of syrup. On the (extremely small sliver of a) bright side, the location is super convenient, Elote Cafe is supposed to be awesome, and Margs Draw Trail is right out the door.If you win the room lottery, never have to interact with the staff, and plan on eating breakfast elsewhere, it's not the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. It would take a lot to bring me back here, though.We stayed at this place on the first week of September 2012. Sedona is expensive and places in the village area are mostly sold as resorts which we did not need.For a modest place to sleep, Kings Ransom is fine, and price is fair.I have to say that I'm pretty easy going when it comes to hotels &amp; getting what you pay for. However!!! This place was definetly over priced! The room was outdated &amp; basic, the walls were so thin we could hear our neighbor coughing all night!! &amp; then of course all the morning hussle &amp; bustle too! The pillows were excessively big! We had a nightmare of a night!! So bad so that we rarly argue but we had such a bad night it we had a rough morning! Stay away from here, not worth it! Motel 6 is a better value!!Came here on a last minute trip and thought this place looked like a cheap enough place to stay for a night.  To my surprise it cost more than I expected but nonetheless we stayed there anyways.  We got there before check-in and were fortunate enough that there was a room open.  Room wasn't great--smelled muggy when we walked in, everything in there was outdated, and we also didn't have regular pillows(?). Not sure if this was just in my room or in every room, but our pillows were TINY (half the size of normal pillows). Not sure what was up with that! On the bright side: complimentary breakfast!My traveling companion from the Netherlands and I checked in on 01/21/2012 and stayed just long enough to discover a bedbug when I pulled down the sheet on my bed.  We were offered another room.  No thanks!  We got a refund and stayed at the clean and accomodating Super 8 Motel across town.We found this at the last minute when we got into Sedona. Location was great because it was in old town not on the strip. The price was $99 for a large room with two beds. This was a road trip with my bf and we just wanted a clean room with two beds in a good location and it had all that. Both the night front desk and day person were very friendly and helpful. It was comfort Inns wi-fi because I think they own them. Nothing fancy but I would stay here again unless of course I was looking for a resort or spa.To put it simply:  this place is a dump.  I was very disappointed, and I'm not ""hard to please.""  I see no difference between this hotel and a Motel 6.  The only other plus is that it sits right at the trailhead for Marg's Draw.  If you're in Sedona purely for the hiking, then this place will do.  Also, be warned, many of the photos depicting the Inn are photoshopped!  It does NOT sit amongst the red rocks!If you aren't going to spend much time in your room and looking for a cheap place to crash while visiting Sedona - this will do. We stayed here on a last minute trip. The room was ehhh. We killed a cricket within the first 5 minutes of being there... ok, not a huge deal. The bed was comfy, nothing special. The biggest complaint I have was the amount of NOISE we could hear from the rooms above us. Maybe it was the location of ours... but man, starting around 6:30am, I heard every step someone took above me. The metal steps that run alongside the hotel - also loud throughout night/early morning. I would recommend requesting an UPSTAIRS room if you do stay here. I'll give credit though, they do have a great continental breakfast complete with a waffle maker and fresh muffins, and a pretty ncie pool area with nice lounge chairs. If you're going to Sedona to be outside, and not looking for a resort-style place to hang - Kings Ransom will do the trick.",,,,,"['recently', 'town', 'wedding', 'looking', 'affordable', 'place',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/briar-patch-inn-sedona,Briar Patch Inn,4.5,$$$,37,"A heart-felt thank you to the Briar Patch Inn in Sedona, Arizona. From the moment we pulled into this sanctuary we were enveloped in it's magical, grounding peace. Every word, every pebble, feels like a gift given with intention. I entered this sacred space raw and yearning and left with healing peace. From a mourning mama with a husband and three adventurous little boys, you honored me and I will forever hold gratitude in my heart. One constructive note: The shower in Oriole cabin desperately needs to be upgraded. A garden hose behind the building might have been better.My wife and I had an absolute wonderful time staying in the Owl cabin. This place is a hidden gem. Quiet, peaceful, almost like stepping back in time. Real fireplaces in the cabins. No WIFI, no TV. A weekend here will send you home a changed person. Eat breakfast right next to Oak Creek. Stare at the millions of stars at night. We made our next reservation before we left.This was a much needed getaway. Stayed in the Owl room. The place is amazing! It is secluded and romantic. A great breakfast every morning,featured quiche, homemade breads or muffins. The staff is amazing very helpful and friendly.  The fireplace is stacked nicely each day. A Great getaway for anyone needing to relax and rejuvenate.It starts with a warm and welcoming check in and it only gets better! Relaxation is something we all need a bit more of, well, go to Briar Patch Inn and you will go home a more peaceful person. The quiet nights, the stars that are brighter than bright and the cabins that are so toasty and warm. It was our second stay (every mid-December) and will not be our last. Polly is amazing and pleasant beyond words; she is so well suited for her job as hostess! Everyone is just wonderful.The perfect place to get away and focus on what really matters. What a sanctuary. There is not one negative thing I can say about Briar Patch Inn. I HIGHLY recommend.Just stayed here for two nights, it was so peaceful and beautiful! We stayed in Robin and you could hear oak creek from the cabin. The staff were very friendly and I lived the personal touches; the fire was made every day, lots of firewood, wine in the room, fresh flowers. Really great experience overall. The bathroom was very dated, but I can look past this because of the charm and tasty breakfast.We love this place everytime WE visit Sedona.   The Establishment, the Staff(Rob &amp; Polly) &amp; Location is the Best.   Hope to be back soon!No other Place in Sedona!!!    The FirestonesI wish a world existed where I had no commitments or obligations other than simply living year round at The Briar Patch Inn. Friendly staff, homemade and thoughtful breakfasts and beautiful grounds running alongside the subtly rippling Oak Creek. I was secretly glad the Sedona Marathon was cancelled when I visited because I thought, 'this means I can stay at Briar Patch and just read beside the fire and walk around!' The Briar Patch Inn is almost synonymous with The Shire in that it's secluded, lush in foliage and seemingly comprised of jovial, congenial hobbits. When we walked into the office to check in I half expected someone to be perched on one of the wooden tables, shouting, ""Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday!"" I really hope to return to The Briar Patch Inn. I know I'd like to see it . . . one last time . . .My husband and I just stayed here and it was amazing. Cute little cabins that were extremely clean!!  Cozy beds and a wonderful fireplace. I use to work in Sedona and I have wanted to stay the night here at Briar Patch for years!!!  Glad we did and we will most certainly do it again!  Good breakfast as well.  Thank you Brianna, for accommodating us on our anniversary stay!I have somewhat mixed feelings after staying at the Briar Patch Inn. First and foremost, the staff is INCREDIBLE. They are so wonderfully friendly and helpful, some of the nicest people you want to meet. Another great point of this inn is that they serve breakfast every morning--and it's a fantastic breakfast of hard and soft-boiled eggs, oatmeal, quiche (which changes daily), fresh fruit, yogurt, breads, and muffins. It was a fantastic way to start your day on the right foot. They also serve cheeses, cookies, and hot cider in the afternoons (which was fabulous). The grounds are really quite pretty and there are a few resident sheep and also a small patio overlooking the nearby creek that goes by the property (which is really pretty). The cabins are all relatively private and quiet, so we didn't hear any noise during our stay. That said, I was surprised how rustic they were. This wasn't a bad thing, but I had thought given the cost of the facility, perhaps the bathrooms and kitchens would be upgraded with more lighting or nicer materials. Knowing this, I might have opted to find another place to stay that was slightly more modern. So that caught me somewhat off-guard. We stayed in the Robin cabin, and my husband is 6' so he could barely fit in the shower---I'm 5'6"" and it was definitely a squeeze for me, too! Additionally, our toilet was placed in a smaller location which made me wonder how people who are larger would fare in that cabin. Not sure if some of the other cabins were like that, but I had hoped we would have a tub or another option for relaxation other than the fire. There are no TVs at Briar Patch (which we were pretty okay with) and you have all the wood you can burn! We were able to still have a nice, cozy Northern Minnesota-style Christmas down in sunny AZ, which was what we were after.A friend of mine chose Sedona as a way to celebrate a big birthday milestone. I reviewed a number of options to stay including private homes through Air BNB and <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FVRBO.com&amp;s=dc89a0f9c902602582311664aed1a3ba88a111619812076106a03f8fc8ab5c6d"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">VRBO.com</a> and ultimately landed on Briar Patch Inn. Upon arrival we were met by a mystical lush set against a babbling brook surrounded by the beautiful red rock that Sedona is known for. Already our expectations were blown.The Inn keeper met us with a smile, a personal note, and worry dolls to set under our pillow at night as we settled into our escape from the technological world. We roamed the grounds and happened upon peacefully placed hammocks, friendly sheep and literally had a butterfly bless our cabin the very first night there.Waking up the next morning took us further down the rabbit hole of this hidden gem when we were met with a beautiful breakfast spread and a LIVE string duet. We thought we might've found a little piece of heaven. No other part of the world existed except for where our imagination would carry us, and carry us it did. It carried us to sparkling watering holes, majestic panoramic views and unexplained energy points. Not only will we be coming back to Sedona to re-experience the enchantment that radiates from all parts of this quiet town, but we will be doing it at the Briar Patch Inn. There is something about that place that makes your soul smile and spirit soar and it's perfect for all ages.There's a testimonial online that states ""Paradise on Earth"" for the Briar Patch Inn; this encapsulates the mystical place that we had the pleasure of resting our heads for 2 nights.  We (my Mum &amp; her best friend - both Australian, my boyfriend - Indian, my friend from Austria and my friend from California) arrived in the dead of night after an afternoon at the Grand Canyon.  Even though it was close to midnight when we arrived we were able to easily find the Inn and were provided the keys to the Ponderosa cabin.  It was a muggy June evening, so to be welcomed by air-conditioning once crossing the threshold was a godsend.  As I walked around the cabin, settling in, I was struck by the influence of Native American/Sedonaesqe decor.  There were gorgeous materials on the wall, comfortable leather couches and unique items dotted throughout.  I glanced at the gorgeous table that could seat 8-10 people and right in the middle was a welcome note with a worry doll box on it.  What a thoughtful gift!  (I think this was particularly needed for some in our party after driving from Grand Canyon to Sedona late at night.... but, that's another story)Waking up the next morning was a delight; from the view in my room overlooking the gorgeous Sedona hinterland, to the expansive (breathtaking!) view of the Arizona landscape on the balcony, everywhere I turned I was impressed.  Inside the house the view during the day shed new light on the accommodation.  The kitchen was large and filled with sunlight, the house was clean and welcoming (with board games to boot!), the bedrooms were sized well and there was plenty of space for a large group + all our luggage.  Breakfast was provided every morning, and what a breakfast it was!  Fruit salad, pastries, quiche, coffee, tea, jams, juices and the list goes on.  Not only was the breakfast itself impressive, but the dining area was one for the history books.  I'd read before coming to Briar Patch Inn that it there was creekside seating, however, I thought that was for the swimming hole or for those who wanted to do a little adventuring.  The dining area itself was next to the creekside, and what a joy it was to eat breakfast next to a creek every morning, the sounds of the running water washing away all negative thoughts preparing you for a day filled with adventure, relaxation or mysticism (Sedona has all 3 options).  Breakfast isn't the only option next to the creek, there is a gorgeous massage room that is available for those needing even more of a wind down (me!).  I had the pleasure of utilizing this service and what a pleasure it was!  The woman they contracted out (I can't remember her name...) was experienced and was able to provide a thoroughly relaxing time.  There's also swimming hole next to the creek and the path that leads up to the swimming hole has a little sheep enclosure and a gorgeous area with hammocks and totem poles.  We stayed up late in the hammocks one night and just watched the stars in the night sky.Overall I would give this place 9.5/10.  The only thing that I could see that could need improvement is little updates in the bathroom amenities (in the cabins) and whole house cooling/heating rather than the small air-conditioning units in each of the rooms.  Thanks to Rob and the team for providing a wonderful experience.  See Hear Speak No Evil - <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdanyellekelly.com&amp;s=79b193724e7fbc3c6361b5c6c20159e2676cada556a4d94d2a4bbb2562db341c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">danyellekelly.com</a>What a fabulous place to stay. The folks were so friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were delicious and plentiful in such a cozy setting. The cabin (I had the Quail) was rustic, impeccably clean and very comfortable. Glad there was no TV. The small wood burning stove was a real treat. Next time I go back- it's the Briar Patch for sure.I just returned to the Briar Patch Inn after my first visit several years ago this past weekend.  It was as wonderful as I remembered it.  If you are looking for a gorgeous place for rest and relaxation away from computers, phones, wi-fi, tv and noise, this is your place. These are rustic cabins right on Oak Creek. We stayed in Creekside where we could hear the rushing of Oak Creek as we sat on our patio and as we played Scrabble in our living room. The breakfast is excellent and is included in the price of the room. The beds are comfortable, and we found the kitchen well stocked enough with pots, pans and utensils to make ourselves a really nice meal the first night we were there. The grounds are beautiful and well tended.  So why, you may ask, only four stars?The rooms could use some upgrading. They haven't changed one bit in the years between when I was there the first time and now, and for what you are getting the price is pretty steep. Also, there was a marked difference in the desk staff and the way they interacted with the guests. The woman who was there the day we checked in and the next day was super helpful and accommodating. She helped us find a Scabble board and a deck of cards, gave me a breakfast recipe and asked if we wanted our room serviced while we ate breakfast. The woman at the desk the last morning we were there asked everyone which room they were in (almost as if her intention was to make sure no one was stealing breakfast) and when I asked for a recipe she told me to buy the book they had for sale (which I didn't really want). When I explained that the person the prior morning had given me a copy of a recipe she said, ""well we really don't do that anymore but I can look.""  It was just a totally different way of being treated and when you are spending close to $400 per night--I expect the former not the latter treatment. All in all this is the place to go if you want a special setting near Sedona and you are looking for something that is unusual, beautiful and dedicated to relaxation.The Briar Patch was everything I wanted and needed and more.  I spent hours wandering the beautiful river looking at rocks and odd pieces of wood that had washed down stream in high water times.  Total relaxation is what I wanted and found away from the traffic and people in Sedona.  The Inn was total luxury for me in a comfortable and cozy sort of way with delicious food and a happy staff.  I wasn't disappointed and plan to go back with my grandchildren the next time!We recently visited Sedona for a week, and we decided to try two different places to stay. We stayed at Briar Patch Inn the first 4 nights in the cabin Wren. This was a magical little place that I thoroughly enjoyed. It's beautifully located in the woods, and this particular cabin is quite isolated on the corner, which is pleasant. The breakfast is delicious, and the scenery next to the creek while eating breakfast is even better. The decor in the cabin is delightfully bright in Southwest designs. There's not much to complain about, but the cabin could be updated a bit. The patio seating had no cushions, which I found strange as much as you want to sit outside with a glass of wine. The toiletries were most definitely lacking with the glycerin soap and built-in shampoo dispenser. I believe this could be improved. Other than that, this establishment is quaint, a perfect location, provides a lovely breakfast, and is a wonderful place to relax with beautiful scenery. I also enjoyed seeing the sheep on the property each day, Wooly and Lilly. When I return to Sedona, I would most definitely like to stay here again.What a great place...I'm hesitant to even review it because I don't want people to know how amazing of a place this is. We had a creek running outside of our door and it was so well kept. Wow. I am writing because people do need to go and support this business. Love this place and if/when I am in Sedona again I will stay here no need to look any further.Amazing!  Everything about Briar Patch exceeded our expectations.  We stayed in Quail cabin and were very pleased...clean, cozy and quiet (the real woodstove was a treat!).  Breakfast was lovely, but must say that I wish it was served earlier than 8am (which is the only reason this is not five stars).  An earlier option, even if less food, would be great.  Nevertheless, the food was delicious with plenty of options, but get there early or you'll be standing and waiting for people to 'decide' what they will eat when you are about to gnaw your arm off.   We can't wait to return and will plan staying for a much longer time to soak in the river, the trees, the relaxing atmosphere of the Briar Patch Inn, plus there is so much more to explore in the hills of Sedona and outlying areas.Unfortunately it rained our whole visit and was very cold and we were told we couldn't use fireplace, that was a bummer. And sadly bc of weather there wasn't much to do, not there fault. But it was cold and couldn't get heat in the bathroom. It was nice to sleep in the rain, beds were pretty comfortable even though place is pretty rustic. I wish breakfast went a little later, I like to sleep in and not rush on vacation. It was beautiful but maybe too rustic for me...I just want to agree with all the positive comments.  We had a really memorable three- day reunion stay in two separate cabins: my sister and her husband in Ivy and my brother and and husband and I in the two-bedroom Heron, both of which are delightful.  Ivy is tucked in cleverly behind the main building and feels very cozy, and Heron is at the far end of the property farthest from everything (which means a lovely short walk along the road beside the creek and past the sheep.)  The fires are laid and the fireplaces lovely, the breakfasts are wonderful and the entire outdoor ambiance is restful and just sublime.  We'll go back.","I am so thankful I made the decision to visit Briar Patch, because it was such a fantastic and relaxing experience!First off, this is the most relaxing place that I have ever been. There is no wifi (except in the lodge during business hours), there is no TV in your room, and the only phone is a payphone. My cell phone got no service in this area whatsoever (ATT&amp;T but Sprint did work). Briar Patch has a wide variety of books and magazines to read, and there is a CD player with local musicians CD's in the room.The fireplace was absolutely fantastic, especially on those chilly nights. They restock you with wood every day.There are so many lovely little spots to visit and sit and relax all about the property, including hammocks and seating areas by the creek. Grab a bottle of wine from the little store a half mile up the road, grab some cheese and crackers from the lodge, and find an area near the creek to relax and share a romantic moment with your loved one.The cabins themselves are huge and fully stocked (we stayed in ""The Oak""). We had a full kitchen with lots of cooking utensils that allowed us to cook and not have to go into town. My favorite part of the experience was the personalization and dedication to customer service. They left a little note with our names wishing us a fantastic time, and it was such a nice thing to walk into. They also let us check in about two hours early. The breakfast was nice each morning. There was oatmeal, hard and soft boiled eggs, a different quiche each day, home baked bread, jams, fruit, yogurt, and muffins; all included with your room. We also had on-site massages from two wonderful ladies. We had our massages in the outdoor ""Kiva"" room because they were renovating the creek site massage hut... but we snuck a peak and boy does that massage hut look fantastic! Outdoor massages are great because you feel more connected with nature, and you get to hear the sounds of nature and birds chirping instead of ocean waves like you get at a spa. I can't wait to come back the next time I need some R&amp;R!I stayed here for three nights recently and it was worth it!! We were in the Kingfisher cabin which had its own beautiful path out toward the private patio overlooking the Oak Creek which was flowing with water. We swam in the creek which is private for guests staying at the Inn. This is where you go to relax. Although Sedona is beautiful it was hard to leave this place. It is cooler down there as you are right on the water and it is absolutely lush and green. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was lovely and included: Soft &amp; hard boiled eggs, granola, fresh fruit, oatmeal, home baked bread, muffins, quiche, jams &amp; jelly's, orange juice, coffee, &amp; teas. Plus as you eat your delectable breakfast creekside you have this most wonderful music performed by ""Lyra."" The breeze is blowing through the trees, the birds are singing the creek water is flowing. Life is good!! You can lay in one of their hammocks and dream and nap and dream...I say go there now! Next time I am there I will stay at Briar Patch Inn :) LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!We stayed here last valentines day! It has such charm and character. I forgot what cabin we were in but it was huge facing the creek. Had a nice fireplace, beautiful patio, and very sweet breakfast in the morning. Although it doesn't get phone service it's really quite nice because you have to disconnect to reconnect sometimes! Definitely recommend to everyone but especially couples!I absolutely adore staying at the Briar Patch Inn.   I've been here several times and have stayed in different cabins... I can't say I like one more than another, it's just the type of space you're looking for.    The cabins are tucked in to a wonderfully landscaped setting with Oak Creek bordering on one side.  There is a fantastic little seating area along the creek for meals, and then a little hidden spot which is perfect for drinking apple cider and enjoying the peacefulness of the river and surroundings.  I love the little paths through the property and little seating areas and gardens, not to mention watching the sheep.  The clubhouse is wonderfully rustic, along with all the cabins, and they serve a nice little breakfast.  If you're looking for pancakes, bacon, potatoes, etc... get a cabin with a kitchenette and cook it yourself because you will have fresh fruit, yogurts, granola (amazing!!!), etc. Bring games, books, or portable DVD players for entertainment at night, because the cabins don't have televisions.    Cell service is spotted throughout the property.  You may or may not have it. The only complaint I have is the fact that there are no comfy cushiony sofas or chairs to sink into.  The furniture they have is lodgepole with thin cusions-- and I personally think they're uncomfortable.  I'd love to have a small leather loveseat to read in rather than sitting up straight on a futon.I've visited the Briar Patch Inn and cannot wait to return! On both visits I stayed in the Creekside cabin and it is absolutely amazing! I found the cabin to be well-decorated in a cute rustic style, very clean, comfortable, and romantic. The sound of the creek flowing below is harmonious, and the outdoor fireplace is perfect for s'mores. Breakfast (both times) was absolutely AMAZING with a quiche to die for. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! You can choose to eat in the main lodge, take your meal to an outside lawn overlooking the creek, or take it back to your cabin. The small number of cabins makes the B&amp;B very intimate and cozy, and the staff really tries to get to know you and meet your every need. You are secluded from the road, have a nearby swimming hole, and sheep graze in a small field. Happiness just oozes out of this place! Overall, the Briar Patch Inn is a wonderful place to stay with either a special someone or with a family group. The prices can be a little high, but it is well worth it! You can also keep an eye on their website or Groupon for specials. On a personal note - the Briar Patch Inn will always hold a special place in my heart as the place of my engagement! :)My family went to the Briar Patch Inn last week and we enjoyed it so much. Every where you turn there is a photo op- it is so beautiful. The breakfast by the creek is amazing and so relaxing. We stayed in the Eagle and it was spacious and comfortable. Definitely recommend.Adorable. The cabins are awesome-- we saw a few on our stay, and they were great. Comfy, spacious, and super clean. The whole place is so cool: trees and flowers, birds, squirrels everywhere, decks overlooking the creek, grills, even a couple of sheep. And let's talk about the breakfast: quiche, hard/soft boiled eggs, oatmeal, cereal, fresh bread/muffins, fruit, yogurt, and more, every morning. Plus cookies, coffee, tea, and cider all day. The service is unbeatable: I've never met such nice people. I would definitely stay here again.My friend recommended me to stay here.I planned my 2 nights getaway in November.Delightful place, but very pricy.They have good cracker &amp; cheese snacks with apple cider.Very helpful front desk staff.Secluded and next to a creek so its really nice to kick back and relax.The property is beautiful, close to nature, has wooden rockaby bench swings, a hammock, some sheep, ... lovely.Bring some chopped apples so you can feed the sheep.Keep your hands flat when you're feeding them.I liked star gazing on the hammock at night.They give you a blanket for outdoor use which is nice.Our cabin had a fire stove/ furnace thingy.took a few tries but it was a lot of fun.Gets warm really fast, but once the fire goes out it gets cold really fast too.I like going and listening to the creek.I would go back again.I can't say enough good things about this place.  It's an Arizona gem.  The rooms are ""comfortable rustic"" (not fancy but perfect for a cabin in the woods type getaway).  The brunch is simple but delicious and the table seating overlooking the creek is beautiful.  On my stays there (about a year ago) brunch was accompanied by truly great live acoustic music that was perfect for the setting.  Had the privilege to meet the owner who lives next door and understood why this place has the peaceful energy it has, which i think is an extension of her personality.  I am regretfully taking away one star - which is hard to do - only because it is not pet friendly.  But, if you don't mind leaving Fido at home, I really can't think of a better place to unwind for a weekend.  Thanks Briar Patch.Charming setting along Oak Creek. Didn't stay here but enjoyed a delightful brunch on a warm summer day with a friend on the way to the Grand Canyon.First off, the breakfast was awesome.  Buffett style, you can pick what you want and however much you want.  Indoor and outdoor seating, you can sit and hear the creek.  The owners/workers are extremely friendly.  The grounds are beautiful and shady.  There are mulitple cabins to choose from for 2 - 10 people.My only two problems: The beds are low quality and uncomfortable.  Also, the website states they have ""swimming holes"" in the creek, but that is not the case.  It is wayyy too rocky and shallow to even dip in.Very charming little cabins scattered around 15 or so acres along Oak Creek. The water burbles in the background, the cliffs soar red and majestic above you, and the breakfast spread is really top notch.  The price is almost as high as the surrounding red rocks, but I guess if you want a really nice Sedona experience, it's not cheap.  As others have mentioned bring some sliced apples for the chubby sheep. Dip your toes in the creek (I really don't think you could swim in it) and take in some yoga on the lawn.  Just be sure to snap out of your serenity while pulling out of the Briar Patch Inn onto 89A, since the great unwashed are driving like maniacs on their way to Sliderock. Look both ways and be careful.This place was amazing!  A small collection of cabins nestled in the trees right along the Oak Creek.  The cabin was immaculately cleaned and beautifully furnished.  Every morning a delicious breakfast is served with quiche, fruit, fresh baked breads and more... and in the afternoons a snack of hot cider and cookies.The management and staff were so friendly and polite, they really made us feel welcome.  The ONLY complaint I had were the beds.  They were rock hard and I had an uncomfortable nights sleep.  With that warning taken into account, I would recommend this place to anyone!Stayed in the Tree Top room for two nights over a fall weekend. I was along for the ride with my friend who was on the first leg of a journey to start her life over. Briar Patch Inn is a good stop for that sort of a trip :)If you are looking for rustic, quiet and TM lifestyle, here's your place.  We were not. Although the staff was friendly at check-in, it is WAY over priced.really, $300 a night?  I was expecting so, so much more for the money. Mother Nature was very evident at Briar Patch but then again, I wasn't paying her. Improvements could include but definitely not limited to:  maybe two small bottles of water or even a small bottle of wine upon arrival?  What about a deck of playing cards in a drawer, or a board game?  Even checkers?  I shouldn't have to leave my room for these items either. A few trips to a local thrift store in town and you could have something for every cabin. And how about a few books to read?  Nothing heavy, maybe a romance, mystery or nice animal story?  What about a decent chair or sofa to sit?  The peeler log ""sofas"" were very uncomfortable, no back support until you hit the poles.  And then there's the soap. Just because something is au naturale and cost three dollars for a sliver of something resembling soap doesn't make it soap.  Didn't like that at all.  I realize this is vegan territory, hard for us carnivores, but breakfast was way too lightweight for our tastes.  I will say the coffee was good and nice large mugs.  The music? Well they ""tuned up"" for almost an hour before playing and by then our breakfast was done. Are they a relative of the owner or something?  Geez, all the CDs in the cabin, all eight of them, we're their recordings!!  A little nepotism?  Would have liked some Sinatra or even Placido to break up the Indian chant tunes.  We won't be coming back and I wouldn't recommend it either unless you wait until the very last minute to find a reservation like I did, and then this is what you get.  Mother Nature outdid herself in Sedona but I'll take Prescott, thank you very much.Hubby and I stayed at the Briar Patch for a little 1st anniversary get away.  What a great place!  It was our first trip to Sedona, and I wouldn't think about staying any where else on our next trip.  We had a lovely little cabin by the creek.  It was quaint and clean.  No TVs, no telephones, no sounds but the creek and the two resident sheep baa'ing occasionally.  Breakfast is homemade and healthy, perfect fuel for a day of sightseeing.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.It's nothing glamourous.  There's no room service, but if you're looking for a comfy, rustic getaway this is your place!  I do kind of wish there was a bath tub so I could soak a bit, but the wood burning fireplace makes up for that.Oh, make sure to get a massage by the creek.  Ahhhhh!We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  The babbling of Oak Creek while eating breakfast or enjoying a massage was magical.  We stayed for five nights with our three children who were charmed by the resident sheep.  The cabins are not luxurious but they have everything you need and are clean and comfortable.  The grounds are completely enchanting!  I look forward to returning again.",,,,"['heart', 'felt', 'thank', 'patch', 'inn', 'moment', 'pulled', 'sanctuary', 'enveloped', 'magical', 'grounding', 'peace', 'every', 'word', 'every', 'pebble',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-sedona-sedona,Hampton Inn-Sedona,3.0,$$,36,"My sister and I recently stayed here while in Sedona. We were very comfortable. Rooms were clean. Free breakfast was good and the breakfast lady, whose name I can't remember, was awesome- really nice, going out of her way to make sure everyone was happy, including the kids. It is located centrally so it's easy to drive anywhere in Sedona you want to. It is an older hotel and I think it's a little pricey taking that into consideration.Ok for what we paid for it. Reasonably clean and comfortable. My only real complaint is the understaffed front desk. I needed to call the hotel prior to our arrival. The first two times I tried, no one answered the phone. When we arrived, the lone front desk girl (I say ""girl"" because she couldn't have been older than 18) was on the phone talking to DirectTV. (Some channels kept breaking up during our stay.) She ignored us and kept talking. We stood there from anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes until she finally completed her call and checked us in. The paying guest definitely did not come first here.Ordinary stay for a Hampton Inn, with the exception of a front desk staff that seemed pretty incompetent. I had to make several visits to the front desk due to confusion about the length of my stay (booked online for two nights but they said it was only for one and I'd have to extend my stay, if a room was available). Half the time there was no one at the front desk and then two different people didn't know how to extend my stay on the computer, so I had to come back and speak to a third person. They also charged my brother for one night as a no-show, although everything was paid in full on my credit card. It was quite a hassle. Breakfast was decent, although lacking in meat options (e.g. chopped meat in scrambled eggs) and fresh fruit. The lobby dining area also got quite crowded, so people had to share tables or eat in odd seating. Location was on a busy highway and not walking distance to attractions, although close to Whole Foods and Safeway. There was an empty liquor bottle in the closet when we arrived, so I guess housecleaning wasn't too thorough.Comfortable clean rooms but, as many brought up the breakfast is bad/mediocre compared to other Hampton inn hotels we've stayed at. The decor also feels outdated and rundown. I wish management would update service and accommodations as it would change my future stays here in Sedona.I enjoyed my stay at this Hampton Inn. Nice staff from checking in to those assisting with the complimentary breakfast to checking out. Complimentary breakfast included the usual fixings of oatmeal, muffins, scrambled eggs, potatoes, yogurt, fruit, and cereal. If you don't have time to sit and eat, there's a to-go bag of muffin, fruit, and water, but that's only offered Monday to Friday.My favorite part about staying at this particular location was the live music! There was a man who played music on his flute during breakfast and weekend nights. The melody matched the music nicely. He's a local Native American musician who plays at different venues and selling CDs for a living. His name escapes me at the moment, Bear something... This location itself is close enough to the ""downtown"" Sedona area, but not close enough to walk. However, there are a lot of great shops and restaurants near by. Behind this Hampton Inn is a nice residential area to star gaze on a clear night. It rained/snowed (mid-May, I know...very odd) one of the days, but ugly weather cleared out. The stars were beautiful. I would consider staying here again next time, but I'd probably work a little harder of finding a better deal. For the price paid, I later saw that it was on the high end for the area.This is one of those Hampton Inns that veers off from the expected Hampton Inn experience. The hallways are dismal; bordering on depressing. Dark, muted color scheme, unlike the bright/uplifting one that we stayed at in Phoenix. The Phoenix location felt upscale; this location does not.A sub-optimal aspect is that some Hampton Inns, like this one, do not provide shear drapes on the windows. So one has to decide whether to keep the drapes shut and use the room in darkness, or to open the drapes and be on display to anyone passing by. Decor/ambiance:  2 stars Service: 3 starsComfort: 3 starsBreakfast: 2 stars (sorry, but awful sausages and way over-cooked oatmeal)Would we stay here again? Probably, but if there was another Hampton in the area, we would try that instead.My family and I stayed here over the weekend of May 30-June 1 2015. The property is very nice and clean, both overall and our room in particular. It has a decent sized outdoor pool and hot-tub/jacuzzi which also were kept very clean. Free breakfast, which was just okay, but get there early or go later because seating is minimal. We also found this hotel to be a decent location - about 4-5 minutes from the heart if downtown Sedona by car, plus nearby shops, restaurants, and stores for wants and necessities.  We would have no qualms about staying here again.Gross motel. Either it's super dirty or there's mold around the toilet and shower in the bathroom.  Would not stay here again even if it were free (which is was for our stay due to points). Stick to other chains or the boutique resorts in the area, you can't really get worse than this place.I booked using Hilton Honor points, as I travel quite a bit for business.  This MOTEL was one of the worst Hampton's I have stayed at.  The hallways were dark, checkin was slow (there was no one behind the desk), the room was picked up but filthy - that was probably the worst.  The furniture was old and outdated, there was black mold in the shower and around the rim of the toilet.  We checked in, set our bags down, and wanted to get out ASAP.  The sheets kept popping off the corners of the bed.  In the morning, we did not partake in the free breakfast, we just wanted to get out of there.  On the main drag in Sedona, but no views.  There are a ton of local budget motels around if you are really trying to stay on the cheap (which this hotel was not cheap, it just felt low quality).  Otherwise, stay elsewhere.  You will sleep better.Hampton Inns are a ""go-to"" in my business travel, and are consistent.  Where a particular property flies under or over the bar is in the details.  As others have noted, this Hampton Inn isn't in the heart of the Sedona business or entertainment districts, but isn't inconvenient driving to either.  Actually, the reduction of traffic and noise makes this a positive.We found the front desk personnel to be engaging, personable and anxious to please.  Also on the plus-side, their lobby coffee (horrific in most Hampton Inns), was actually quite good.  Water pressure and temperature consistency, air conditioning, room size and furnishings, parking (behind the building) and WiFi bandwidth were each adequate.  I'm not a big breakfast eater, but my family and I found enough to get us started for the day.  Fresh fruit would have been a nice addition, and is a part of the typical Hampton Inn free breakfast.This does appear to be a late-century building, but is pleasant and-- hallway carpeting aside-- well-maintained.Ultimately, for whatever minor deficiencies we found, the area is so beautiful that we had no reason to diminish the Sedona experience through petty complaints.  We would stay here again.Cleanest Hampton Inn I've ever been too.. Nicest staff and just a great place to spend the night.. Nice free breakfast, coffee all day, spakling clean pool and jacuzzi.  Can tell the management cares , even housekeepers say hello and are always smiling.. I'm sold on this hotel !!! A+++Stayed on the President's day weekend.  Very busy (for winter at least).  The room was clean.  Beds were good.  Don't expect a view; but you also pay a lot less than the hotels with a view (which can reach up to twice the price).I have posted photos of the bathroom.The breakfast was good.  They had bacon and sausage patties, along with French toast and make yourself waffles.  They also had oatmeal. If they had scrambled eggs, then it would have been awesome - but only a few laces have cooked eggs.  But there did have hard boiled eggs.   And of course the various other breakfast items (pastries, fruits, cereals, juices, etc.).  They also had flavored little coffee creamers.  nothing expensive, but most places only give you plain creamer.I would recommend they cook their bacon and their sausage patties more.  not that it is was underdone, but it just wasn't browned.The pool and spa are typical size.  It was heated which is nice for winter.  The pool was not hot, but just warm enough to go in.The lobby was decent.  They had a computer to use.As some other poster said, when I got there (around 5:00, so not late) there was no one at the counter and I waited for about 5 minutes.  Of course 5 minutes seems like 15 minutes when you are standing there wondering why no one is there!Wi-fi, which is very important to me, was easy to get on and strong signal.  And it was free.  Parking was also plentiful and free.Generally a good experience.This hotel is very dirty. The first room we were checked into had a 3'x3' patch over the shower that was obviously not water sealed/protected since the paint was peeling and there was black mold. We pointed it out to the management and they reimbursed our stay as well as giving us a new room. That is the one aspect I am happy with. There was no argument, just an apology and a new room right away. The second room had mildew in the shower. We just scrubbed it off instead of creating another hassle for ourselves. We went to use the hotel pool that night. Since it had been thunder and lightning most of the day, we found it strange that the pool towels were all dirty and lying around with no fresh ones. It's not like anyone had been using the pool that day...After getting our bath towels and walking back down the hallway - which smelt like hot garbage-we decided not to use the pool or hot tub. If the showers and hallways were a dump, we didn't want to know how long it had been since the hot tub had been cleaned so we just skipped that. I would not suggest this Hampton Inn to anyone.Best thing about Hampton Inns is their consistency - rooms updated, good cleanliness, and good service.  I give it 5 stars for the value it provides.  Location is right in the middle of everything in Sedona.  Close to all kinds of restaurants and short drive to much of the sightseeing and hiking you would want to do.Clean room with a fridge, microwave and flat screen tv. Lobby is nice. Comp breakfast. Haven't used the pool or hot tub but they look clean and inviting! Sedona is so amazing, but can be pricey and this hotel is affordable! Around $150/night. Just minutes from the downtown ""touristy"" area.Pros:  Relatively inexpensive place to stay in Sedona. You generally know what you are going to get in a name brand hotel chain like this, with some exceptions noted below. Great location to attractions, sights and restaurants. Staff is courteous and attentive. Free breakfast and WiFi. Efficient check in and check out.Cons:  Hallway carpets need cleaning or need to be replaced. No hot meat items served with breakfast and not having them has not been my experience in other Hampton Inns I've been to. No in-room safe. Somewhat noisy heater in room.The hotel itself is a little worn-down, but it's very clean. My friend and I were looking for a budget hotel for our Sedona trip and it fit the bill. It's in West Sedona, but it was a short drive to the main areas of town. Easy check-in and check-out, courteous staff, free Wi-Fi, average budget hotel breakfast.My husband and I typically stay in Hampton Inn (we are Gold members, so we get perks).  The customer service seemed fine, and our room (king) was much larger than a typical hotel room.  We could have easily fit one or two roll-aways beds into the room comfortably. The hotel was a little on the ""worn"" side - this is not a ""new"" Hampton Inn, but it seemed clean.  It's a good location - close to the grocery store, restaurants, and centrally located to most of the major attractions.  My biggest complaint here was the breakfast!  The oatmeal, waffles, and cold item selection is adequate, but the attempt at hot food - Soggy, barely-done microwaved potatoes, ""omelettes"" with some sort of southwest ""paste"" (ham, cheese) in the middle.Overall, we would definitely stay here again for the price and location.This was by far the best place we stayed in during our Nevada/Arizona trip. It was clean, the staff was friendly and courteous, and the location was very convenient. Beds were comfortable, room clean, decent bathroom. Although it would have been nice if the vanity had not been in the bathroom. The breakfast was a little disappointing. There was a tray of fruit that appeared to be grapefruit with something else. It must have been frozen and then thawed. But it was yucky. I had to spit it out. The omelet looked good, but tasted bland except for the cheese. The oatmeal was cooked in a crock pot instead of being instant, and that was good. I would probably stay here again.As I sit here in my room at midnight after just checking in, I decided to quickly write down my experience this far with this location.  I also notice that one review has been written on the other account listed seperately for this exact hotel location.  And i share the sentiment even thought that review was written in 2009.VERY  UNWELCOMING STAFF. i approached the front lobby doors.  The automatic glass doors did not open?  There was a house phone next to the doors and so i picked up the phone and dialed ""0"".   A man answered the phone and said ""what do you want?"".  Really, this is exactly what he said.  I said i would like the door opened!  Heasked if I was a guest here and i told him i was.  Then he opened the door.  ......well i could continue on about this conversation but really, the point was I told him that asking me what do you want is not welcoming at all!  He just starred at me.  He asked for my credit card and swiped it.  The problem here is that I am a Hilton Honors member with gold status.  therefore, the hotel is never to ask me for anything when i walk in.  The key should be ready and there should be cold bottled water and cookies ready for me.  Neither was available and when i asked if he was the night manager he said ""no-is there a problem?""  I had to be honest and just say yes-its YOU.  Neither of my room keys worked after I returned to the desk THREE times!  Seriously?  Is this even a Hilton company owned hotel?  This is the worst!  And the rooms have never been remodeled.  They are small and ovecrowded.  I didnt even have a computer chair in my room.  I instantly fell in love with Sedona on this first visit and would love to come back very soon.  But I have no desire to stay at this hotel ever!Also, I forgot to mention, during the day of my arrival, I called 4 times at different times before they answered the phone!  (I was trying to confirm my late check in)","Tried to get an early check in but the answer was no.  So them I asked can I just check in and leave my luggage. No too. I came back 1.5 hrs later and a different gentleman allowed me to check in at 1pm.I was not treated like an elite member. No newspaper to my room, no card saying my room wasn't serviced bc I had a ""Do not disturb"" sign up and offering for me to call them if needed. I'm disappointed!!! Spend the extra $50 overnight and go to the Hilton Resort. Too many kids for $149 per night.After my second night, I again didn't receive my newspaper though the rooms next to me did.  ???I will never stay here again. This is not the kind of service that Hilton builds their reputation on!On the other hand, the eating/breakfast staff was lovely and accommodating.Clean, close to restaurants/bars and good customer service, not to mention a nice pool.I can't give this hotel a good review. The floors were sticky. Also, the mattress was extremely hard and when I woke up at 3:00 am, my back hurt making it impossible for me to fall asleep again. I was looking forward to showering in the morning to help energize me, but the shower went from lukewarm to cool. I don't ask a lot from a temporary room, but being able to sleep and shower comfortably are what I'm paying for. Breakfast in the morning was much better than a typical continental.Nice, basic hotel. Everything seems clean and relatively well kept up. Rooms have standard amenities plus small microwave and fridge. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate were available all evening and even fresh cookies until they ran out. Nice common area was in use be a number of clients for playing board games. But the best of all was the manager on duty - Julia. She had great recommendations for places to eat and things to do, was remarkably professional and pleasant as she dealt with a constant stream of varied requests from guests.Service and cleanliness were great during my stay. However when I got back I realized they had charged my credit card numerous times without my consent for ""incidentals"". When I called to report the error, they did not offer any help &amp; I had to contact my credit card company directly. Beware of fraud!Free wifi, friendly staff, clean rooms, good lobby with computer to print your boarding pass, and centrally located.  I would stay here again!  They also have free breakfast, which could be better, but is definitely adequate for something that's free (small boxed cereal, yogurt cups, waffle maker, and some frozen and reheated breakfast items, like potatoes and eggs).  The beds are comfortable and bedding is nice.  There was a mini-fridge in the room to store drinks and food (no mini-bar).Place is dirty, dingy, front desk Julia did not advise us of the free breakfast.I am on the phone trying to call them to get a receipt for my boss' stay.  The phone has been ringing 10 full minutes now and still no answer!I asked for assistance with an issue I had regarding some documents i needed scanned and emailed back home.  Without hesitation Jennifer took care of it, assisting me in sending the documents in a timely fashion. Fantastic customer service here!  Jennifer was wonderful!Best buy for your dollar. Clean facility, efficient and super nice staff. Convenient. Excellent suggestions for nearby eating. Very sufficient breakfast bar. Locally owned and operated. New Sedona residents, M. InglisThe building itself is not something you are used to! When you visit sedona youll see that the buildings are made to look like rock. So i thought it was a nice touch.  This one has a really nice lobby and friendly staff.  It also has a really good location.  Visiting the area I was given a map and found everything I was looking for from food to scenic areas for photos.  Also if you are interested in taking a pink jeep tour, they pick you up and drop you off from this hotel.All in all I can't say I can complain about this hotel.  It's nothing fancy (as most Hamptons aren't) but it's one of the better ones I've stayed at.Awesome stay!  My wife and I went on our first year anniversary and we loved it.  The jacuzzi was making a little too much noise and we called it in because we were trying to sleep.  They were very professional and upgraded our room.  We got a good night sleep.  The beds and pillows are very comfortable and clean.  The next morning we found out that they had a variety of breakfast items to choose from.  My wife and I made our own waffles and served ourselves warm potatoes bits that were freshly made.  They had fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, juices, milk, coffee and more just waiting for us - it was all free!  In effect, we didn't have to have breakfast at a restaurant!  Later that day we asked the staff to help us plan our trip to the Grand Canyon and they were informative and exhibited alacrity.  My wife and I agree, we loved our stay at the Hampton Inn.  It was an aesthetically pleasing and enjoyable stay. Thank you!Unwelcoming staff, bare minimum rooms, tiny bathrooms with the appeal of a rest stop toilet. Forget it, unless your only alternative is to sleep on the side of the road.We ended up at this hotel by default after reader reviews told of major problems with similarly priced rooms (hard-sell time shares, peeling linoleum, stained carpets, noisy fridges, etc). The Hampton was delightful, with a well-designed building and grounds, convenient location, clean, spacious rooms, and friendly staff. A few reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5: The Internet connection from the room (wireless) or the computer in the lobby is as s-l-o-w as maple syrup (better, of course, than hotels which have no Internet service or charge extra for it). The Internet server would not allow me onto Yelp (a prohibited site). I was trying to get reviews for restaurants, so I had to look up reviews on Expedia instead of Yelp. Why is this? The breakfast is not as good as advertised (frozen fruit: yuuuuk). But these are minor complaints compared to many places I have stayed that have far more defects, so  I would still recommend it.Nice hotel with good breakfast and friendly staffs but their wi-fi is not Mac friendly :(",,,,"['sister', 'recently', 'comfortable', 'rooms', 'clean', 'free', 'breakfast', 'good', 'breakfast', 'lady', 'whose', 'name', 'remember', 'awesome', 'really', 'nice', 'going',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sedona-pines-resort-sedona,Sedona Pines Resort,3.0,$$,33,"Clean comfortable small stand alone units in a resort that shows pride of ownership. Each unit has a nice deck with table and chairs for dining outside.  Each unit has a charcoal bar-be-que and there are larger shared gas units around the resort.  Differs from other typical timeshares in that the units are stand alone and spaced attractively around small streams that end in rock fountains.  Grounds are attractive and meticulously maintained.Entire staff is courteous and helpful in every way. WIFI is on again, off again in some units.  AT&amp;T doesn't service this area at all.  Each unit has a wired telephone from which you can make unlimited free calls in the USAWe stayed at Sedona Pines for one night, and it was a pleasant experience. We had the two room cottage, and it was perfect for two couples, one with a baby. The main cottage had a sitting area, small kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. The second bedroom, which was located across the deck, had a bed and bathroom. The deck provided a nice separation for privacy, while the main cottage was nice for the group to hang out. While the amenities weren't exactly modern (read, from the 80s), it had everything we needed to make our short stay comfortable. We took advantage of the mini golf course, which is pretty small, but has 18 holes and the equipment was easily accessible. Assigned parking spots were nice and convenient. We didn't try the restaurant or pool/spa, so I can't comment on those. I would give this place a solid 3.5 stars, but since half stars aren't available, I'll round up.Awesome place to stay!!!  Been coming every year since it opened!  Sparkling clean.  Very well maintained.  Free mini golf &amp; nice pool &amp; ADULT hot tub if you don't want kids around.  Staff is very nice &amp; helpful.  5 stars!!!!!Wonderful place! Very accommodating and friendly!Great weekend getaway! The big, not crowded, saltwater, lagoon style pool is a big plus.  The rooms are more like a vacation home than a motel room, but you don't have to clean it or pay a cleaning fee - so you get the best of both worlds.  The kitchenette is very nice, the bed and the sofa sleeper are very comfortable, the amenities are very high end and the property with the chair swings and ponds make you feel right at home.  As far as wildlife goes, we had a big laugh when a bat dove for a June bug and buzzed my daughter in the pool, so who knows you might see something.  There is a cattle guard, so javelin and deer will only be visible outside the perimeter.What a mess of a resort! Preface this with there was a random snow storm during our trip which had a huge impact on the quality of our stay.Cable went out in our room for 3 days and although the front desk informed us all of northern Arizona had lost their cable the rec room and gym conveniently still had signals. All of the activities were cancelled for our stay which is understandable as the freeway was treacherous the first night but was plowed by the next day. The restaurant was closed so we were snowed in with no food options,THEY CHARGE $45 for ""CLEANING"" where they swap your towels, throw out ONLY the bathroom trash, and take your sheets away without replacing them. THANKS SO MUCH.Nasty retired people living in the RV! Think they own the place! Harassed my dad and swung a weight at my mom's head. Called the front desk and they acted all concerned but never did anything about it or returned our calls.They made sure to sweep all the snow and ice off the steps of the cottages where people were checking in but were content with the rest of us slipping on our way down the stairs. No activities for kids which means they are running around and screaming in the streets.The front desk is a rinky-dink piece of trash compared to their sales entry and desk. sure makes you feel valued now that they already have your money.I overheard the front desk people saying how pissed off all their guests were and how many people were checking out. Turned into a ghost town the second night we were here even though they were booked through the week.You're also pretty far from Sedona compared to other resorts, like 10-15 minutes.I can deal with the claustrophobic small cottages and mildew sheets and towels but being stuck in here with no cable, or activities, NO WIFI SIGNAL (and red rock park tlaquepaque and downtown sedona all closed) was a living hell.They are single wide manufactured homes that have stucco over them.  Nice decks added on and inside is in nice condition.  The park is maintained nicely.  We played miniature golf (free).  There was no cell phone service we have TMobile but they have a wired phone you can use, just let them know yours didn't work so they don't charge you.  There is no secured internet and it's made very clear at check in, would have needed to know this ahead of time since we had business needs to tend to.  I guess they have sales pitches and breakfast that goes with it along with activities that you can pay to do?  Bring extra whatever you need for less than 3 nights, you don't get maid service.  They need to replace the couch and chair, the cushions are ruined for comfort.  It's nice though to have a living room, small kitchen and separate bedroom.If you need coffee buy it at the store or buy it from them.  Need a map, stop at the Tourist Center in town or buy it from them. You get my sentiment.  There is however free laundry, how nice is that?  I couldn't tell if the pool/spa was open so we didn't use it.  Honestly, I was too afraid to ask the clerk who checked us in.  I dealt with that at checkout with the manager. Mike seems to be doing a good job of turning things into a positie experience.  If you have any issues call him in the morning, he dealt with an issue we had in a very professional manner.  Hope I covered it all, I would have left a less positive review if it hadn't been for the Front Desk Manager (Owners pay attention to that comment and follow his plans for the front end of the resort).Pleasantly surprised. I booked this resort before I looked at the Yelp reviews and was quite aprehensive before we got here, but it appears that the management is quite responsive to issues brought up in Yelp Reviews. I came with elderly parents and grade school kids around Thanksgiving and stayed 5 nights.  Kids can go into the pools and spas, there is just one spa that is adults only.  They have tons of art classes for the kids and adults and they are wonderful. The kids made frog keychains and I did a watercolor class. Very fun!  They have a playground, basketball court and miniature golf. All appropriate for kids.  I went to a yoga class and the instructor was the real deal (like studio yoga);  she was very good and able to include people of all different yoga experience/abilities.  The units are pre-manufactured cottages and the layout is like a single wide trailer, long and skinny. My family (+ kids) stayed in one unit (one bedroom plus a pull out couch) and my parents had a separate bedroom attached via a deck (half of another unit). They had a separate bathroom.  The units are new, ceilings vaulted and very clean.  They have free laundry, and even give you detergent and dryer sheets!  How cool is that?  They have a microwave/convection oven combo, dishwasher, and enough dishes to feed my family Thanksgiving dinner.  Parking is right outside the units. Since AT&amp;T doesn't work here, they allow you to make calls to anywhere, from the landlines. They have computers in the office so you can check email.  The wifi in our unit worked perfectly though.  They have tons of movies to rent.  The grounds are immaculately clean so any rodent issues previous reviewers had must be an anomoloy.  We are in the desert and the resort backs up to wilderness areas and this is where these creatures live.  The resort is 4 miles from Sedona (we measured it) off of a 4 lane highway. It only takes 5 minutes or so from Sedona.  Beautiful.The cabins, which are small manufactured homes, are fine. They are very cozy, there is plenty of hot water, and the kitchens are equipped well enough to cook a basic meal. The couches and chairs and beds are comfortable, which is not always true of timeshare resorts.We did get a phone call, asking us to attend an informational meeting to sell us a unit. There was a gift available, as usual. We declined (From other experiences - don't go to one of these meetings if you enjoy relaxing on vacation - timeshare sales are notoriously aggressive. A dental cleaning is more pleasant, but I digress...)The WiFi is passive/aggressive. We were warned by the desk clerk that it ""wasn't reliable"" and he was oh so correct. You will get a signal for 2 or three minutes, then you'll get bumped off. Then you'll be on for 20 minutes, and every thing will freeze. And forget about making phone calls, getting texts or getting on the internet if you are an AT&amp;T user. Zero to 1 bar. Our travel companion had much better luck with Sprint, which worked well (both phone and iPad).The cable (Direct TV) was also very spotty. It went out completely one day.It was winter, and very cold and we did not use the workout room or the other amenities, but we saw many others using the features. We were told about a yoga class and a craft sale.Overall, a nice place to stay. Don't depend on the wifi.Get out of your room and enjoy the amazing view of Sedona!First of all, this review is for the ""Sales Presentation"" - NOT THE RESORT itself.  The resort itself has very friendly staff, cute cottages and welcoming.  I like the fact that I can park my car in front of the unit and my room is right across from the huge adult jacuzzi (that closes at midnight).  If I rank the resort -- it would be a five star.  However, this review is for my experience with the sales staff at the sales office.  When you check in for longer than a few days , they will ask the guest to see a concierge and the concierge will ask you to attend a timeshare presentation and they will give you a gift.  This is what happened to me .... and I read the previous Yelp reviews and the same thing happened to another lady. Yeekee! Summary: I found the Sales Managers Darren to be extremely rude, horrible customer service, and I think he is a racist (because I can't think of any reason why he would act and talked the way he did).  I don't want to make this a racist issue, but I can definitely feel there was discrimination from him.  The other manager Lydia had no customer service skills either.  The receptionists had attitudes and really initiated the entire terrible experience and it ruined our day in Sedona.   Most Surprisingly, I spoke with the Broker - Greg  (its a sales office, so this is considered a real estate office with licensed agents), and all he did was defend his employees - particularly Darren, saying that the manager has been with him for 15 years, etc.... I see where the entire staff get their customer service from. I wish they would hire a consulting company to come and train on customer service, also they should all go through a diversity course so they know how to deal with people from various cultures and backgrounds.  This is what happened: I had a sales presentation appointment for a 2pm, I went there early at 11am trying to see if I could attend early so I could leave Sedona and go to another city.  ( I told the Concierge Lady that I was going to do that).  I showed up about 11:02am and the girl on the left of the counter helped me, I learned that the presentation doesn't start until 11:30am.  I said okay, I would love it if they could squeeze me in if people don't show.  I proceeded to sit on the couch and wait until 11:30 to see if all their appointment showed up.  The receptionist had no clue and didn't understand what I was saying or try to do.  She ask the girl next to her, a girl with dimples, she too had no clue and didn't understand the process.  They think that I want to be seen ""NOW,"" which is not the case, I want to wait to see if I could take someone's spot if they are a ""no show"".  I sat on the couch for about 15 minutes or so, then I went to the girl on the left and said ""is there any paperwork I need to fill out for either this presentation or the later presentation?"" she said ""no, you already filled out all the paper already (I brought my confirmation letter with me)"" then she proceeded to say ""we still can't take you right now ....."" I was thinking in my head .... I know, I was just asking if I need to fill out any paper for this presentation or the 2pm presentation.""???? Then she whispered to the dimple girl, then the dimple girl went to the back, then a manager came out at around 11:20am (Lydia is her name), and said we can't take you ""right now"".  I explained to her --- I understand you can't take me ""NOW""; if its okay with her that I would prefer the 11:30am session and I understand if everyone showed then I wouldn't be able to.  However,  I would like to wait until after 11:30am to see if there are any ""no shows"" so I could take their spot, she said ""sure"", it would be more like 11:45am.  I said okay, I will wait if she doesn't mind, she said okay.  Side note: From the moment she came out to the moment she left .... I sensed a little attitude.Meanwhile, I could hear the receptionist say that they are waiting for 6 more parties to show up.  I counted 4 parties that came in.  So I am thinking, we might have a chance .... 2 parties didn't show so 2 spots may be available.  11:45am came and gone.  Everyone, including the 2 receptionist left to the back since 11:40am.  So I waited 10 more minutes until 11:55am and proceed to go find the manager-Lydia, whether we could be seen or not.  At this point ... I had already been there 1 hour.   At this point, the receptionist came back, and I began to tell the receptionist that Lydia said that we would know at 11:45am ..... Lydia came at this point and said ""we can't see you now,"" you have to come back at 2pm.  While talking to Lydia .... Darren (whom I never spoke with prior, started SCREAMING and said we don't need to come back at 2pm. Talked demeaning  ....I wish Greg, the Broker, in charge of these agents could see the surveillance video of how rude his employee Darren treated us and was extremely rude and insulting. (I notice they had surveillance on the outside - not sure if they have it insideSEDONA's finest tourist trap with quaint cabins. Enough to drain the charge from this sacred and energetically powerful land is a marketing scheme for time shares aimed at tourists. The exchange of energy and time with these people is not worth the gifts. Be weary.I got an online deal to stay at this place so I decided to give it a try during MLK weekend.It's a timeshare but they never tried to sell anything to me which I appreciate it because we weren't gonna buy. The only reason why we stayed there was because I got the deal. I imagine they offered the deal to make it people go but the tour or presentation was voluntary. They mentioned it at check in and we just didn't request it during our stay. I thought they'd ask about it when we checked out but they didn't even mention it.Checking in and checking out was easy. Management filled in my form for my <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">restaurant.com</a> gift card that was part of the deal without putting pressure on me to do their timeshare presentation.Calling it a resort is maybe too much but the place's actually very nice. Very close to Sedona and they have tons of amenities. They had daily classes and activities. Free Wi-Fi, free laundry and a place for kids to play. There's also an 18 hole minigolf!! Super fun! We didn't try their restaurant/bistro, though. They also offer room service :)The cottage itself's very small but it's fine for a short stay for a couple (even with a kid, it's fine). 4 adults may be too cramped in there, though.Our cottage had wood floors and the kitchen was super nice. Electric stove and all the appliances you need. They even have a dishwasher!! They provide with all the basic tools you need to cook (pots, pans, silverware, plates, glasses, wine glasses, bowls, you name it!) and even some coffee filters, sugar, creamer and dishwasher detergent. Kitchen had a coffee maker, blender, electric can opener, bottle opener, microwave oven... I mean, you could cook any meal in there! We didn't use the laundry facility but there was some detergent and softener in the cottage too.Bathroom was a good size for the size of the cottage itself. They provide with tons of towels (even extra towels in case you wanna use the pool). Masted bedroom's tight but you don't really need more space. Tons of storage all over the cottage. Nice TV, DVD player in the living room and bedroom area.Signs on the freeway are too small and we got lost. Also, the sofa bed in the living room was extremely uncomfortable (and noisy) but that's just a problem with any sofa bed, I believe. A daybed with a trundle bed below may be a better option but that's just my opinion.Distance from the city wasn't too far at all. Less than 10 min by car to get to Uptown Sedona. Surroundings were very quiet and relaxing. There are water fountains and water running all over the property.If I get another deal like this one, we're definitely coming back for another long weekend.All in all I can say the resort was terrible. However, the rooms were really small. It was okay for the both of us but any more than two people and it would get really cramped really fast. The place was amazingly clean though. The stuff was very helpful. The pool was a good size and warmed to the point where it was comfortable not too cold. The exercise room was a tad small but nobody used it so I don't think they will be upgrading soon. The reason for the three stars... No wifi, no cell phone service! My understanding that it's OK to get away but when you're in a strange place of relying on Google Maps this can be a real pain in the ass. Also how was I supposed to use my Yelp account! Sedona is a beautiful place but been there done that. This is Steve justice comfy at home signing off.This is off the path about 7 miles away from Uptown Sedona and you will have to drive if you stay here.  I was hoping for a place that could be closer to the trails, etc.If you are looking for a resort to relax this might be your place.  However I did not see any views from here.  You will have to most likely drive to enjoy the views of Sedona.  I would say keep looking if you want a 5 star resort experience.I recently vacationed in Sedona with my boyfriend. It was my first time there, and my first vacation in a long while, so I was ready to relax and enjoy time away from work.The resort is not actually in Sedona, it's about 10 minutes from Uptown Sedona. We stayed in one of the units that included two cottages; one with a bedroom/kitchen/bathroom/living room and the other with just a bedroom and bathroom. PositivesJacuzzi:Huge, clean, powerful jets and a waterfall.Towels:Lots of towels, too many for just the two of us.Parking:Directly in front of the cottage, assigned.Other:Basic kitchen utensils included.Vaulted ceilings.NegativesDoors Opening and Closing:We made 4 trips to the front office to get new entry cards in order to get the correct set that opened both of our units. Even then, we had intermittent issues with opening one or the other cottage doors throughout our stay. So we never really knew when we would have access to our belongings.Also, the entry doors don't close! Be warned that you may think your door is shut, but  it isn't. We had to push against the doors with our full body weight in order to get them to latch properly.Fire Extinguishers:The fire extinguishers in both cottages were not up to code. The tags on the extinguishers did not reflect that they had been checked or serviced since their installation in November 2012.WiFi:WiFi is free, which is probably why it doesn't work with a damn. We were one of the closer units to the front office (where I assume the WiFi originates) and we weren't able to use our tablet for most of the time. Also, the resort has taken it upon them to block their guests from accessing adult websites. Yes, I'm serious.Linens:The blankets, linens, and towels smelled badly. I couldn't have the sheets or blanket next to my face because it made me feel nauseas. Also, the blankets are horribly thin, so I would suggest bringing along your own or requesting more of theirs, but remember that theirs smell pretty bad.Heater:On our first night there, the heater in the bigger cottage broke around 4am. It was 52 degrees in our cottage! The resort boasts that they have staff at the front office 24/7 ""for guest convenience"". However, that proved to be incorrect because we tried calling all of the extensions listed for the front office/manager's office from 5:30-7am with no answer. We ended up switching to the smaller cottage around 7am (the heater in there wouldn't turn off!) We finally reached someone at 7:30am who told us that she couldn't do anything because the guy that fixes stuff wasn't in yet, so we'd have to wait. We called back at 8am and she said he would be over shortly, which turned out to be another 45 minutes. We were in the middle of getting ready for our day when the guy showed up, said he fixed it, and left. We left shortly after him for the day. When we got back, the temperature was only up to 56 degrees which I attribute to the sun, not the heater. We decided to sleep in the smaller cottage for the rest of the trip. We're sure that the heater still hasn't been fixed.Noise:The groundskeepers start their leaf blowers and lawn mowers around 7am, so sleeping in is impossible.Kitchen:The kitchen is ""galley style"" which means it literally IS the hallway from the bedroom to the living room. It's functional, but ridiculously tight. Only one person can work in there at a time.Other:This is a time share resort, so they try to give you the sales pitch to buy a cottage or whatever. We politely declined, and that was pretty much it.The provided soaps smell awful. And there is a card next to them indicating they are a ""one-time gift, not meant as a provision"", which means the resort will not provide more throughout your stay.The phones in both cottages would randomly beep (loudly) throughout our stay. We aren't sure what that indicted, but it was annoying.Stray cats. Stray cats everywhere.I received a free cruise in the mail from Sedona Pine Resorts. I called the number and I was told I had to go listen to a presentation. I ask them if this was the place by Desert Ridge and he replied yes. He said since I had not been in the office for a couple of years they would like to see me again. I told him I was not able to buy because I was in a car accident where I broke my neck, had to sell my house and I am putting everything back together again so I want not in a place to buy anything and if I was going to buy it would be a house. They gentleman on the phone said it was fine and set up the appointment for 1/31/15 at 11:30I showed up for my appointment and an older white hair man named Bob walked me back to his cube. I was honest up front with Bob that I could not buy right now because of my situation. Bob started looking at me with slanted eyes and said if you are not going to buy what should we talk about. I told him he could give me the presentations. He started giving me a nasty attitude and replied verbatim ""why would I waste your time or mine by doing that?"" And he just stared at me with dirt eye. I grabbed my phone because I was very uncountable and I replied to a text. Bob says to me ""if you do not but down your phone the 90 minutes starts now.""  I told him he was being rude making me feel unconfutable and I wanted to speak to him manager.  He then continue to give me even a worse attitude as he went to grab the manager.After sitting in Bob's cube for about 15 minute... Jim the director shows up. I explain the situation to Jim. He said he remembered me from 2 years ago. I told Jim I could not buy and how Bob had treated me. I told Jim I explained to the guy on the phone I had been here before and I was not able to do anything. Jim proceeded to scrunch up him face and squint his eyes at me and tell me they cannot have people on their phones playing scrabble. I told him jim, Bob was being rude so I grabbed my phone to reply to a text. Jim then asked me who I spoke with on the phone. I told him I had no clue.  Then Jim started to get more rude and scrunching his face at me. I told him I did not appreciate him treating me rude because I was not going to buy. He asked me what he was doing to be rude and telling me Bob was not rude to me either. I scrunched up my face mocking him and showed him what he was doing to me.He said I would have to sit with Bob for the remaining time. I expressed I did not feel comfortable with Bob. Jim got up look around for a minute and came back to tell me that I would need to reschedule because there was no one else to help me. I told Jim I was not going to rescheduling, that I drove 30 minutes and I had been in the office for over 40 minutes. I told him I would watch a video. He told me to leave the office. I asked for my cruise invitation back and he refused to give it to me and threated to call security. I have never been treated so rude and hurtful by a company in my life. This was the most unprofessional people working and representing a company. I was upfront about not be able to buy and was treated rude, had things turned around on me and wasted my Saturday morning. I get they are about sales but I was honest and I cannot believe you have these types of people representing your company. I will never stay at one of your resorts and I will let everyone I know not to  go to one of these presentations.Pleasant but we won't be back. Not enough room for  big kids and adults but quaint as it is a  sweet RV park. Activities' breakfast was limited and prompt but free, informative and we won a cool prize. Not a great place for kids- this is definitely the post retirement set and most aren't happy to see kids. The don't allow kids in any spa and we were posted up across from the Lagoon which is a pool sized spa. Trust me the other guests will freak out if your kids go in the spa or make noise in the pool. It really is an old folks home. Don't waste your weeks/points if you are younger than 65.The update on RCI points isn't  worth your time spent from 9-12 with small children despite the 90 minutes they insist and told them repeatedly what we were interested in. Heard nothin about the new resort and loads about our sales ladies'  previous vacations. Diamond has a more concise presentation without the the 3 hour bottom line for essentially the same system. They didn't honor our interests at all and have turned us from the system. Kids just sat and watched TV- no activates or crafts.  Diamond has real child care, tye die shirts, keychain a, a bag of stuff and real food. Can't say the same here- it was a timeshare person who regretfully admitted she had to go ""babysit""  while we were at reception. I nearly had a heart attack as a stay home mom- this girl didn't give a shit and at that moment I was nearly done.  They literally watched movies/games and that girl didn't interact at all. Our kids were upset that it took longer than the  90 minutes promised and are still debating if the jeep tour was worth our time. Maia was pleasant to my husband but ultimately routinely insulting to me which ruined the deal- just from the moment I voiced hesitation. Don is a closer and adorable- he does well for his job and is appropriately suited but still a closer. Darren and Don were charming and pleasant . Darren was super charming and  I'm sure does well- if you're his wife- he loves you and gushes about you!!! You are fortunate! ;)However we have had other women who were far more charming and pleasant- she was assumptions  . Insisting I breed negativity? WTF? Us so cal people dont believe you're vortex theories BTW we don't use our money to buy $5  lattes everyday  or $6000k purses but should I assume it's a compliment that you think we do?  Restaurant on property is fantastic and staff is working their buns off-Make a legit happy hour and this place will take off- took the night off from Elote and it was really great. Get some legit specials and live music and this could be great!!!Super cute, clean cottage. Kitchen well outfitted...small but mighty. Stove top, microwave, coffeemaker, full fridge with icemaker.Comfortable bed. Sleeper sofa is very acceptable. Super awesome shower. Big and strong water pressure. Flat screen TV, cute dining area. So much packed into 399 square feet. We skipped the ""free"" breakfast and timeshare presentation. We did eat at the cafe twice. Both very good meals.  Well priced, great service. Spa hot tub is so large it is better described as a small pool. Very nice and clean. Difficult Wifi connectivity, but they warned us that may happen. Would recommend! Enjoyed being away from the crowds.I rated this pace 5 stars for the following reasons.- we were comfortable- we did not have to eat out- kitchen was useful- The unit was very clean- plenty of hot water- parked right out front- Free laundry soap providedWe were a family of 4 + dog in a 1 bedroom; 1 bath; pet friendly unit. We stayed for 2 nights. There is a front porch with benches table and 2 chairs. All we used the resort for was to sleep and eat while we Mtn biked and hiked in Sedona; we did not use any of the resorts amenities.It is conveniently located for the area. 5 miles to Safeway grocery. 20 miles approximately to Jerome, AZ. We found the unit comfortable the kitchen was well equipped minus an oven. Our unit had a grill (park style) our front which we used to cook hamburgers. The one bedroom had a queen size bed that was not uncomfortable but not the best nor the worst mattress. The bedroom is small, me and the wife could not pass each other. There is a small TV with cable in the bedroom. The kitchen is a galley style not much counter top space. We cooked breakfast and dinner.The fold out bed had a very thin mattress glad I didn't sleep on it. There was a dinner table with a bench and two chairs. We eat all our meals at the table. Things I didn't like- Wi fi was spotty- Our units bedroom faced 89A at night we could here the road noise.Things to note:- this place is a time share- they only clean the rooms once a week- There is a kid free spaWe have been at this resort three times.  The accommodations were wonderful for us.  However, the bedroom across the patio offered basic bedroom amenities which could have been enhanced w/ a small refigerator and microwave.  Some of the negatives are that the resort is not in walking distance to any stores, gas stations, or, in our case, towers for receiving calls on our cell phone.  One recommendation is to offer a shuttle to town (5 or 6 miles away) so that one is not ""stuck"" if there is no car available.","OK: Admittedly, the units are very small and the Internet is iffy. Otherwise, this is so worth it.Staff was fantastic. Helpful, informative, gracious, and nice. We got kind of lost late at night getting there and the security guard met us at the entrance to guide us into the place.The unit was spotless and very well equipped. I'm a foodie and love to cook, evenon vacation. I turned out some wonderful meals in the kitchen. I was surprised not to have an oven, but discovered a way to make crispy-crust delicious pizza using a frying pan with lid. My husband raved about it. Also made big. light sourdough English muffins w/o the oven.The place was perfect for 2 of us, each with our own computers and lots of books. Great shower and jacuzzi soaking tub in the unit.While people complained about the setting, they neglected to mention the grounds, that are absolutely lovely: Fountains, beautiful landscaping with native plants and rocks, little streams, and a number of small roads you can walk around for some exercise and to get a great view of mountains from the back or the property.We got internet in the unit just OK, but it was great at the office and we didn't mind going there to check emails.The location was perfect bc it was quiet. We did day trips everyday so we were out in the car anyway. We hiked several times with a very short distance from the place, so we found the location convenient.The pool area was very attractive and comfortable. On Saturday night, they featured a 1/2 hour concert by an Indian flutist that was really impressive...and I was a music professor, so it's a big deal when someone can impress me!All in all, a very good time. We'd definitely go back.This is a really tough one as I'd prefer to give it 3 1/2 stars.  With a 4 star ranking, I'd definitely look forward to going back.  With three - it's OK but not my first choice.Positives!  Super friendly staff, immaculate grounds (many people keeping it clean, amazing), very clean rooms, vaulted ceilings, light/airy, heated pool, miniature golf and very nice community.  Wow, so many positives....why only 3 stars?Negatives.  The same everyone states.  Zero view, far from town, internet is a joke (internet is ALWAYS a huge factor in reviews!!!!  Fix the internet and I'd add a star), layout of the modular homes (cramped for a family of 4), fitness center is MEH at best, and activities were also MEH.  Also, the laundry is separate - a HUGE negative with a family.  We are Wyndham owners and perhaps I've  gotten accustomed to a higher standard.  Wyndham's hit our demographic perfectly - it's all about family (6 and 9 year old) and over-delivery.  Wyndham will actually call during the stay to make sure we're happy.  While there were families at the resort, it was a broad mix.  That broad mix kind of gave the resort the feel ""We're trying to be everything to everyone, yet miss the mark with everyone"".  For instance, the pool is heated and nice, yet boring - it's just a pool.  The activities were from BINGO to childrens crafts - nothing exciting.  You see grandparents walking, kids walking and couples walking.  While this sounds perfect (and usually is), it was a slight miss and the lacked the 'buzz' you get at 4 and 5 star resorts.As for the awful reviews - I fully disagree.  This is a solid resort and does not deserve the 1 and 2 star rankings.  Just because the internet sucks, there are no views and it's not close to town does not make it ghetto!  Realize what you're getting and you'll be fine.There were two bad service experiences.  First was the free breakfast - get there EARLY!  We were a few minutes late (we're on vacation!) and they had no available seats.  Try being the Dad (feeling like an idiot!) and telling the family we need to leave and not have breakfast.  Worse, a vendor told me in front of my family to arrive on time next time.  Yeah - that hurt.  The other bad experience was William who tried to sell us a timeshare.  He was misleading and withheld critical information.  I've done a LOT of research on timeshares and know what to look for - he intentionally 'fluffed' far too much.  He also said he would pay us to sell our Wyndham Timeshare and give us an RCI timeshare at no cost - hmmm. In the end - he wanted us to pay $18K!  Worse, we explained we NEVER buy retail - often picking up a timeshare for free (check out TUG) in the aftermarket.  Why waste our time knowing the answer is NO.  He left such a sour taste in my mouth I still cannot stop thinking how awful he was.  The saying ""You know a salesman is lying when their mouth is moving."" defines William.So, when you put it all together - this is a 3 star resort.  Go early for breakfast, DON'T listen to the sales pitch, enjoy being off the grid, be happy to be away from the crowds and this is closer to a 4 star resort.  For us, this is good enough, but a Wyndham is what we enjoy.Really nice and pretty resort with nice private cottages and lots of amenities. BUT, the place is far from civilization, and if you expect to use the internet here while you are in your unit you can pretty much forget about it. The wifi is weak and unreliable, you have to go to some common area like the office or the laundry. Normally I would still be ok because I have a generous cellular data plan, but AT&amp;T doesn't work worth a flip right here. That is not the resort's fault, but that means I can't really use my mobile phone or internet while I am here, so I will not be back unless they fix this.We stayed for 4 nights. We booked through RCI. Truthfully, the only reason I picked this place to stay was because we had expiring points and needed to use them and this was the only place available at the time. I didn't have high expectations but was mildly surprised at how nice and comfortable it turned out to be. Yes, there's an '80's feel to the cottages but everything was well-maintained and CLEAN. Our unit - they call them cottages - was close to the laundry which was great because I really needed to do some. Check-in was quick and easy, checking out was fine except for the $45 resort fee that we were charged (which probably pays for the ""free"" internet wifi, ""free"" laundromat, ""free"" gym, etc). I think that since the resort fee is a mandatory charge, then just charge it at the beginning of my stay instead of zapping me with it when I'm about to leave. It really was the only irritating thing about our stay.The resort is a few miles outside of the tourist area of downtown Sedona so a car is necessary. If you want to be IN Sedona, don't stay here. It's quiet and the units (or cottages) are spaced far enough apart that you don't hear your neighbors at all. I liked that we don't share a wall with anybody unlike a hotel where you can hear your neighbors flushing the toilet, taking a shower or talking. My husband I took daily walks at dusk and except for the maintenance golf carts, we sometimes felt like we were all alone.The one-bedroom cottage is small. We're not big people and it was still tight in both the bedroom and bathroom. It's supposed to fit 4 people but don't believe it. The one-bedroom unit is designed for two medium-size adults to move around comfortably without bumping into each other. The shower/tub was pretty spacious, though and the water pressure was nice. There was plenty of storage in the bedroom and bathroom for all our stuff.There were more than enough towels and linens for two people. And they even provided small bottles of shampoo, conditioner and lotion which isn't common in most timeshares I've been to. The kitchen is galley-style and has room for only one person to work in there. But we ate only breakfast in the cottage and spent our days out. When we arrived, the table was set and the radio was on and playing some very relaxing music. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed including pots, utensils and plates (Corelle). No oven in the kitchen but the microwave is also a convection oven. However, I didn't go to Sedona to cook and bake so that didn't matter to me. The unit has lots of windows so it feels very open and spacious. I liked all the light coming in but my husband didn't like it so much early in the morning when he was trying to sleep in! Also our bedroom was adjacent to another cottage's air condition unit which was pretty loud during the day. However, with temps in the 50s at night, the A/C units didn't come on at night (thankfully!)We used the laundromat, the adult spa, and played mini-golf but we didn't do any of the scheduled activities.The location of the resort, despite being outside of Sedona has absolutely no views of any of the beautiful red rocks. Wifi was spotty but adequate. We weren't in Sedona to sit in front of our laptop and update our Facebook status either so spotty wifi wasn't a big deal. I found that most of the recent photos I found on the internet of Sedona Pines were accurate. The resort itself is very clean and looks to be regularly maintained. Frankly it was way better than I thought it would be despite reading some unhappy reviews about it being in a ""mobile home with stucco"". The units are so much better than that. I'm really glad I stayed here and would consider it again next time we're in Sedona.this place deserves 5 stars even though it's not a five star resort. But they have 5 star service and a great vibe.there's no granite in the kitchen; it's small. But everything you need is in the kitchen and it's in great working order. I burnt a pan and they brought me a new non'stick pan that was bigger and brand new (haha that's cool)there really isn't a ""sedona"" red rock view, but the hot air balloons are there in the mornings. Their pool(s) are awesome (salt) and in great shape. The laundry room was massive and free! Bam!This place has individual units; no shared walls; no BS. You have a private deck with table and chairs and your own charcoal BBQ. Really unique for a timeshare. They even cleaned out my old briquette from the nights before when I grilled! Ya dawg!You are on vacation. Unpack your shizzle and go hiking. You'll be comfy back at the Sedona pines when you get back.The rooms are a touch small, but incredibly quiet. It is far above some of the hotel chains that were closer to the heart of town. The fact that you are provided your own BBQ outside the patio instead of having to use communal grills next to the pool is a plus. I never had issues using the WiFi as I am posting the review with it now. The points value even during peak season is incredibly reasonable. I will state this, it is more of a couple's retreat than a family get away based on the size. It would feel like packing a family of 5 into a motor home if you have little ones. It is close, but when it is a weekend get away for a couple that has been overworked and had little time with each other for most of the year it was ideal. I preferred that we were out of town for the stay, we were greeted with that impressive red rock wall every time we drove into town to visit the sites. It took my breath every time.So beautiful quiet and tranquil, had a great week there this week! Thanks!  Can't wait to go backStayed here a week with our RCI weeks.  The grounds are kept very nice and the free laundry facilities are a plus.  Kitchens are tiny but do have all the utensils / pots / pans you could want although they do NOT have a proper oven (the microwave can work as a small convection oven). Annoyances are the size of the units (small is fine but these things are tight - no real wiggle room if you have a few people in there), only a queen bed,  and their wifi pretty much never works unless you are sitting in the reception area.  One other regret is this is NOT in the town of Sedona - it's just South (only 5 mins - granted - but better to be in town I think).(Note we stayed there October 2010 - Yelp says it's closed - it's not)this place reminds me of Motel 6, I should have found one of those. I will not stay there again. Service staff just OK. Rooms small, WiFi was spoty, kitchen really small.As a time share owner at an RCI resort, I am sorely disappointed in the way this place conducts business.  Horrible service to people who become a part.  Beware!The only draw back is it is a bit outdated (a bit of an early 80's feel) ....other than that the place is adorable and the staff is really nice. A great place to stay if you plan on spending time in surrounding areas and not just sedona.This was a great vacation for us.  The suites were comfortable and the service was very good without being overbearing.  It was exactly what we needed after a cold winter in Canada.This is a really cool timeshare property - all units are self-contained cottages. There are flowing water streams and fountains all over the property, very relaxing, very zen. There is a great restaurant on property run by a Paris-trained chef yet reasonably priced. The staff are wonderful and free entertainment is provided every evening. We liked being outside of town yet within a few minutes drive. There is a red rock formation behind the property and the area is very scenic. We will definitely visit Sedona and stay here again!",,,,"['clean', 'comfortable', 'small', 'stand', 'alone', 'units', 'resort', 'shows', 'pride', 'ownership', 'unit', 'nice', 'deck', 'table',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/arroyo-pinion-hotel-an-ascend-hotel-collection-member-sedona,"Arroyo Pinion Hotel, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4.0,$$,40,"If you are coming to Sedona for a trip, not familiar with where to stay, and want to keep things straightforward, here you go:1) Uptown/west Sedona = doesn't matter. You can drive where ever you need to go and it's easy. 2) Paying extra for a view seems silly when you are out hiking and likely just going to sleep. 3) If you stay in Uptown, you will have a LOT OF TOURISTS. My rate was totally fair considering I had a jacuzzi (omg, right) and a king bed.The rooms are clean and try hard to give an upscale vibe. Parking was easy, and the room had a small patio (that didn't have a view, but a nice place to have an end of the day glass of wine) and the breakfast options are vast (waffles, hard-boiled eggs, oatmeal, sausage, etc). I would absolutely stay here again.Yes, the other reviews are correct in that the place is a little noisy. They have a little basket in the room with bottled water and a treat, as well as ear plugs.We had a great time staying at this hotel. Upon arrival and learning that we were celebrating our first anniversary, the hotel allowed us to upgrade our room to a king suite with a jacuzzi tub (we reserved the room through Priceline which resulted in a 2 queen bed) The room was very clean and came w complementary water, pretzels and popcorn. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was huge!After around 30 minutes the staff at the front desk called and mentioned they had something for us at the front desk. They gave us a box of chocolates and a lovely card for our anniversary. The staff obviously care about ensuring their customers have a great experience. There was free breakfast in the morning which was fairly good. Our only complaint was that the hot tub was closed for the season. We highly recommend staying here at the Arroyo Pinion hotel.The hotel is ok, not the best in the area.  The rooms n building itself is a bit out dated, but with the price is comparable.  Walls are thin, people like to close their doors hard, so you will hear a loud slam everytime someone just let go their doors.  Pet friendly is a plus, but it comes with a price for 20 bucks per day per pet.The afternoon staff, I think his name is Robert? He was wonderful and professional.  He called after we checked in to make sure everything was ok. However the morning staffs were not as great...need to improve their communication skills a bit.  I understand that they were busy the night before and no early check in, but the first reaction I got was not to pleasant from the staffs.  We offered our information to input in their system, so we can speed up the process once the room is ready. Then we were just going to get some breakfast they offered in their lobby since we have to wait around, the staff member got loud and told us that we couldn't do that since we were not ""offically"" checked in...however I did paid for the room through priceline and they took my credit card info.  Just because I was not ""offically assign"" to a room number, so we were not consider a valuable customer?!  To be honest, she made us feel cheap like we were so greedy that we tried to score ""free food""!!!  After she made a loud embarrassment of the situation, then she said it was ok just for this time, so we could have the food...really lady?!! They need to learn to speak to customers in a professional way, not tring to get their point across by ""talking down"" to their customer specially in front of others guests in the hotel...we are adult here, no one is tried to be low class or acting stupid.  We understand that there are rules, but it could be handled in a better way, perhaps speak to your guests in a softer tone or in private.  No one wants to be speak to like we are some low lives who were so hungry need to steal your food!!I was really impressed with the staff, one staff member in particular by the name of Sedonah was exceptional in terms of customer  service. She went above and beyond to make sure I was happy. If you decide to stay here, ask for Sedonah. She will take good care of you.More like 2.5 star rating.Pros: friendly service and big roomsCons: noise. It was so loud all night that couldn't even sleep (despite using the ear plugs they left in the room). If you are looking for a good night sleep or relaxation, this is not the place. Plus room wasn't that cheap.My husband and I had a fantastic stay at this hotel! The room was very nice...well kept and comfortable. Our room had complimentary bottles of water, bag of popcorn, and bag of pretzels, which was a nice touch. I loved the strands of lights behind the headboard, it made for romantic mood lighting. All of the staff I encountered were very friendly. Especially the man who was staffing the breakfast area - he was so upbeat and did a great job keeping everything stocked. The breakfast buffet was great! The property itself was clean and had nice landscaping. Overall, it seems like they care about all the little details that make a great stay. I would definitely recommend!If I could rate this hotel a 0 on customer service I would. Everyone at the front desk especially then men are extremely rude to the point it is almost harassing. I will never return and will make sure to advise every single person I know to not go here. Worst service in the world. I would much rather sleep outside in the freezing cold then stay here again.This was one of the only lesser expensive places around.No Views here.King size comfortable bed with large Jacuzzi tub.Good AC.Back area on lower level.ProsGood friendly serviceDecent Gymgood location of Hwy 89APlenty of parkingConsDated roomsSmall Bathrooms.Glorified motelNo easy access with a lot of baggage.Our experience at this hotel was amazing! Checked in late in the afternoon to a very welcoming staff &amp; was a super easy process. My sister and I were offered cookies &amp; fruit infused water (yum). The office was clean, big &amp; so was the rest of the property! We got to our room &amp; it was so cute! I was surprised with how spacious our 2 queen bedroom was. The decor was warming &amp; matched the whole Sedona feel. Our room faced the pool, yes the pool is small but its surrounded by tables and chairs. We easily went down there to eat and relax. The next morning we had their FREE continental breakfast. It was way MORE than a continental breakfast because they served waffles, pancakes, bagels, cereal, oatmeal, eggs, potatoes, sausage &amp; much more. It was also pretty tasty. We were elated and so happy with our stay. Definitely will be coming back.The place was clean. I like that they provide complimentary cookies in the lobby. We had the pool and hot tub to ourselves at night. The room we got didn't have a special view or anything (we could see into the back yard of a house).Not bad for a Motel!My husband and I decided to drive into Sedona a night early from our reservations. Amara was fully committed for Saturday night so we had no other choice but to call around for a place to stay for a night.. This place was a good deal for the price. Nice size fridge, great air conditioning, flat screen, microwave, complimentary WiFi.. and I'm very picky about running HOT water, and I was not disappointed. Breakfast is over at 10AM.Poorly designed rooms, small jacuzzi, rooms THUNDER when adjacent doors close. Bathroom incomplete, tub and vanity outside bathroom, making it awkward, at best. No blackout curtains, morning sun waking you prematurely. Electric AC unit rattling all night. +1 For hot breakfast, it was good. Poor room, for the rate. Would not recommend.My wife and I stayed at the Arroyo Pinion Hotel during our visit to Sedona. While we didn't have a great experience, I appreciate the staff following up with me after our trip and ensuring that we receive a full refund. Overall, I'm a satisfied customer.Totally serviceable, but not a bargain, or a premium experience.    What do you look for when you stay at a hotel?  Break it down:  Some folks want a place they can get for a great price.  Great is relative, though, since hotels cost more on expensive cities then they do in cheap cities.  Some folks want a premium accommodations: marble baths, plush carpet, 1000 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets. If you've ever stayed at (or been upgraded to) a suite at one of the nicer hotels in Vegas, you know what I'm talking about.      Arroyo is a ""lil of column A, lil of column B"" type of hotel.    A room here costs between $150-$200 a night, which is not crazy expensive...but not cheap either.  Sedona on the whole is a bit overpriced, so I'm going to call this hotel ""moderate.""You get a large room, reasonably comfortable bed, a gas fireplace, and a very awkward jacuzzi in the sleeping area.  You get a large fridge, and a microwave. There is a small flat screen in your room, with a decent number of free channels. Unfortunately, the towels are scratchy, water pressure is low, and the bathroom is small enough that the sink/vanity is outside of the shower/water closet area.  Wifi is free, and they give you access to breakfast that is a mixed bag.  Fruit, yogurt, bagels/cream cheese - all good.  Eggs/sausage?  Inedible.  There is a pool that is great if you are smurf sized.  Kinda small otherwise. Front desk staff is helpful, but not very knowledgeable about local hiking or attractions.  When asked about the difficult of specific hiking trails, for example, I got a lot of blank stares.  Which is weird, considering hiking is one of the major attractions of the area.  If you are not seeking a premium ""Vegas-style"" hotel, and can stay here for $100-$125 a night, go for it!  Otherwise, see what else is out there.Hotel is located right in the tourist trap zone aka Main Street. It's relatively cheap to stay here but the price does reflect the room conditions. They do serve breakfast if you absolutely need to eat; otherwise this is something easily skippable as the food isn't that great.I like the apples they have in the lobby. These make great snacks for hiking.Not the cleanest hotel I've been in, but the beds were comfortable and the complementary breakfast was GREAT! Fresh orange juice, good choices of fresh bread, mini muffins and bagels! I recommend a deep cleaning of the rooms!We stayed in this location while visiting the Sedona area - which was several weeks ago and I just realized I uploaded lots of pictures and never reviewed the place (oops)!  We booked the room online prior to going up for the weekend and it was a painless process.  Upon arrival, all we had to do was check in and grab room keys.  The doors were a touch difficult to get into with the new key system they have here, but once we figured it out we were good to go.  The room was obviously a renovated room as alluded to on the hotel's booking site online.  It was very modern and even had USB charging ports in the wall along with the AC plugs, which was very convenient.  Probably the most lacking thing was the porch area outside, although it rained for a large portion of the weekend, so we wouldn't have used it much anyhow.  It's not too bad of a drive to get to the main attraction areas in downtown Sedona, but parking in downtown Sedona when you don't book a hotel on the main strip can be a touch of an annoyance, but on the flip side it is why this hotel charged less for a night.  The service was just as easy upon check out. Overall: A-It felt a touch tight in the bathroom, which is design of the place, and not so much the hotel's fault since there isn't much they can do about it now, right?  We will probably stay on the main strip next time, but this is definitely NOT a bad night stay if you are in the area!My partner and I came up to visit the vineyards in cottonwood, made our way into Sedona and decided to stay the night. We were greeted by a really sweet girl named Katie who was so nice and gave us a great deal on a king room with a jacuzzi tub and fireplace. The property was super cute and clean. A perfect romantic getaway and only a  5 min drive into town. We will definitely stay again. The whole staff was super friendly!! Well done.We come to Sedona quite a bit and have stayed at so many different places...private homes, hotels and a few of the resorts.  We had a change in plans and made last minute reservations (less than 24 hrs) and decided on Arroyo Pinon for the price, location and amenities based on the website. We did check out another website for recommendations and reviews and they were not as bad as what the Yelpers posted.  The other website had more recent reviews.  Upon arrival we were able to check in early and my son loved they had cookies waiting also apples which we took for our hike.  We got into our room and it was clean no ugly hairs anywhere, the bathroom was stocked with nice towels and the bedding was clean (but I didn't have a blue light or anything).  I noticed we had golden yellow bedspreads oppose to dark brown, but all the sheets were white, clean and soft. A few nice amenities included free Wi-Fi, coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee, a safe, microwave and small refrigerator.  The Arroyo Pinon included breakfast which wasn't that bad.  They offered  eggs, bacon, sausage and waffles.  Also a variety of bagels, pastries, yogurts, instant oatmeal and cereal.  It probably saved us 40 bucks for a family of three.  So, all in all we were all very comfortable and very please with the amenities.","On a good note: beds were comfortable, hotel is in good proximity to town &amp; hikes -and bottles of water are offered daily for free, with a free breakfast and a clean (small) pool and Jacuzzi. However, beware - this is nothing more than a glorified motel.The cleaning staff does not understand one single word of English, so I find it hard to believe they are legal citizens.  Not one word.  You would think that at the very least: English words to comprehend of ""coffee, bugs, towels &amp; toilet paper."" should be on the job application for a housekeeping position. Nope. No matter what you try to ask them, ""packets of make up remover"" are handed to you?  If that doesn't satisfy you, then toilet paper is thrust into your arms (?). t don't even use makeup remover &amp; how does that relate to ""can you please keep your voices down we are trying to rest,""  or, ""the coffee machine is broken can you please send maintenance?""    One day, we received no clean towels at all.About 50 or so, spider wrapped bugs, or something fuzzy, gross and grey, was in our wall AC unit, which continually blew dust and allergens into our room from the site under construction next door. Also not mentioned when booking.  One night they were using a crane at 10PM and all day on Sunday, while we were resting for our long trip back home, they were cutting with an electric saw. We all went home sick and I am still on antibiotics for whatever I caught there.The cleaning staff,  doesn't appear until 4pm daily and one of the gals spent all her time one day with an extremely LOUD, Walkie talkie, on the highest volume (and I mean loud, really, really loud) talking a mile a minute to her boyfriend it seemed, while she was IN our room.  Even though we continually asked her to leave, making ""pushing motions"" towards the door and clamping a pillow over my head, because I could not take it anymore, she would to leave. The front desk was finally called. They did send a guy up to talk (interpret) for us, they claimed but she quieted when she saw him coming down the hall. He said a few words, then soon he too, joined in on the talking &amp; laughing right outside our door? WTH?This was supposed to be a wonderful weekend with my 86 year old mother and sister with Breast Cancer, for a once in a lifetime family reunion.  Literally.  Most went home sick with flus, headcolds &amp; sinus infections.  No doubt,  since when we showed up dirty wet towels and trash were in my sisters adjoining room from the previous guests.  Not a single penny of compensation was offered to us for the poor service, when it was mentioned to the front desk staff, both as it happened and at checkout.This is not a luxury hotel  Don't be fooled by their title. They don't even have an elevator, so a warning to Aging Guests, beware: There are stairs everywhere, no elevators, so be prepared to lug heavy bags all around yourself.We stayed a week at Arroyo Pinion, using it as a home base while touring Sedona and the surrounding area.The rooms are up to date, very nice, clean and roomy with a fridge and microwave. The Wi-Fi works well and it is centrally located.What sets this hotel apart is the always friendly, very helpful staff. Everyone genuinely wants to help out and make your stay nicer.They have a clean laundry area that was helpful on our cross country trip.They also offer free hot/cold breakfast that has the usual offerings, all of which were good.Could not have asked for a more pleasant stay.Couldn't have asked for a better stay. Where to begin??? We found this hotel after calling many to get a group rate for a wedding we were having in Sedona. We were looking for a hotel that would be comfortable and affordable for our guests who were flying in and, oh boy, we couldn't have been happier with our selection. The front desk staff that we interacted with, Katie and Edna, were both so helpful and friendly. They were always eager to help and made the check in/out process so easy and nice. Some of our guests had some troubles with the reservation process at the beginning, but the manager, Rani, was super quick to respond and sort it out. They not only reserved some rooms for our guests till a certain date, but also discounted it a great deal for them as well. The rooms were updated, clean, spacious, and appealing. Our room, which was updated by the manager as a gift, had a jacuzzi, fireplace, and patio. They also placed roses, a beautiful card, bubblies, and chocolate as a gift in our room as well. We were tarted like royalty by the staff. The morning breakfast was better than most and free. Plus this place is super easy to get to. If you ever have a chance to see beautiful Sedona... STAY HERE!My first time to Sedona,AZ.  Such a breath taking hidden delight.  My hubby and I are Choice Hotel members, and found the beautiful hotel through Choice, and we are very please to have found the Arroyo Pinion Hotel.  We are from San Diego area, and plan on taking the trip back to Sedona, AZ this spring to see its beauty again, and we will definitely seek reservations here.Spent our honeymoon weekend here!  The staff was terrific, room was great with patio, fireplace, and jacuzzi.  Nice location on west side of town to head out to Verde Valley wineries and Red Rock Crossing.Stayed here 2 nights....I would stay here again.Nice, friendly,helpful and a  good location.Newish remodeled hotel. Not sure if this location was some other hotel in the past.Haven't stayed at any other Sedona hotels, but I rate this below average to hotels in other cities that I have stayed (low $100 range). There is morning breakfast: bread, muffin, pastry, waffle, etc... your basic variety.The room itself was ok, remodeled, but you can feel the layout is dated. The remodeled room had some sloppy workmanship, the tile grouts were sloppy and uneven (one notices these thing doing #2).The room has white curtains, the thicker curtains are fixed to the window ends (can't close). The white curtains could be transparent when the interior lights are on.The price of an overnight is high, doesn't match the return.BTW, their signage on the building facing the street has crooked letters, one of the ""O"" isn't installed correctly... Intentional or sloppy workmanship?My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the Arroyo Pinon Hotel. I read mixed reviews on another site, where I will also leave a review, and may have hesitated for a second to book. After comparing other rates, amenties and location, we knew that this was the hotel for us. We chose an updated room that had a small terrace and a very comfortable bed. I haven't slept that good on a hotel bed in a long time. We didn't use the jacuzzi tub, but the shower was decent as was breakfast. Love the waffle maker. We did use the hot tub and pool. So perfect after hiking. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with hiking areas and do's and don'ts of Sedona. We will stay there again.I was very happy with this hotel. The rooms were extremely clean and updated. I do wish the jacuzzi was a bit more secluded. I was looking forward to a soak but changed my mind as the location was right near the highway. Additionally, the breakfast was meh. Other than that we were very happy with our two night stay.Very accommodating hotel. They give you a little gift basket included in the room and has very nice beds. Highly recommended.Clean hotel. It's a ways from town, so you have to driveif you want to wander around the shops and restaurants, but if you dont mind, then... The breakfast was average at best. I would stay again if I had kids with my, but if it was a hubby and me only trip I would opt for a hotel in town.I am sure there are worse hotels, but not in the area.  Yes, the prices are good, but the value is poor.  There are so many things wrong.   This hotel is not clean.  I would never stay here again and would steer anyone away from it.Here's the good, bad and ugly.  Bad and ugly (far more of that):1) Housekeeping is VERY poor.  When looked around our room after check-in, we saw a pubic hair right next to the sink drain.  The bathroom was gross.  We asked to be moved to another room.  In the new room, the bottom sheet was not tucked in.  The bathroom floor had a piece of black dirt right in front of the tub, but we could live better with that.  The dirt stayed in the same spot for 2 days, so it's obvious they did not clean the bathroom floor.  On the date before check-out the spot was clean.  The housekeeper also left a note/envelope soliciting a tip.  I guess that is why it was cleaned that day, when it was not the previous 2 days.  2) Security.  This hotel is not secure.  A)They do not have the normal latch you see on the inside of the door.  I am talking about the one that you can set from the inside and cannot access from the outside.  There is only the one lock. B) They put a sticker on your room key with the room number.  That might seem like a good idea, but, if the key is lost, this becomes an invitation for someone to break into your room.  The hotel should know this. 3) The lobby closes at 10 pm.  The lower price attracts a lower-end clientele.  We brought our laps down to the lobby to process some photos and there was a trailer-trash group of people hanging out there.  Very annoying.4) NO amenities other than pool and hot tub.  They were not open during our visit.  It was a bit cold for the pool, but the hot tub should have been fine.  There is no restaurant or shop in the lobby.5) The complimentary breakfast is horrible.  If you do decide to chance it on this place, make other plans for breakfast.  Words can't even describe how bad the ""breakfast burrito"" was.  It was like a microwave burrito with some really sloppy, indistinguishable mixture inside. The texture was unrecognizable.  The eggs seemed to be from a mix. They do have yogurt and instant oatmeal.  This breakfast was very disappointing.6) The decor is very dated.The good:1) Free wifi in the room2) The price for the area (price, not value).  It is probably $10-$15 less than other hotels in the immediate vicinity3) The linens and bedding seemed clean.We did look at changing hotels but, practically everything under $200/night was booked. Sedona was packed during our stay, due to travelers displaced by the Grand Canyon closing (budget shutdown).I would not wish this place on anyone.Paid about $134. Hotel looks good from the outside- up to date, attractive. Smooth adobe stuccoed exterior painted in a Sedona-esque color palate. I like the trees that surround the property, and there is a tiny little botanical garden in the adjoining lot- so extra star for that. It's nice and quiet as well. I can tell that they are trying to remodel the property and improve the rooms, but I was disappointed.Room set up is weird- immediately to your right in the entry is the sink and vanity. Then there is a bathroom to your left with a tile shower. As you enter into the main sleeping area- there is a large Jacuzzi bathtub next to the bed.  I walk over to the desk and pull out the chair- food crumbs on it. I look at the brown carpet and notice some dingy stains. I look at the dated chair in the corner and the ottoman is missing a wheel and sitting there lopsided. Definitely not at the Ritz here. Lol!I have a bug paranoia and always check my mattress. The first thing I notice is the dark brown bed spread.. who knows what's hiding on that spread. I feel it should be standard that hotels provide all white bedding so that you know what you are sleeping on... but I digress.  The next thing I notice is that instead of king size pillows on the king size bed, there are about 5 small pillows arranged diagonally.  I also notice that the hotel webpage says that the rooms have down pillows, but the pillows are not down. I pull the brown bed spread back to find wrinkled and slightly worn in looking sheets. There isn't a fitted sheet on the bed, but instead, a regular flat sheet that's not tucked in, just thrown haphazardly over the mattress. I lift the edge to check for bugs and see that there isn't any type of mattress cover, just an old fuzzy blanket type thing that covers the center of the mattress only and a chewed on sunflower seed kernel.Good news is, I did not see bugs, but I'm not feeling too good about anything else at this point. Then I discover that the red black out curtains are for looks and do not in fact pull shut over the sheer white curtain. I decide I need to say something. I can't be in a 1st floor room without privacy while I sleep and change and take a bath, etc.So, I go to the front desk and I ask if they have a room with black out curtains. That's when I was informed that I was ""doing it wrong"". Turns out there is another black out curtain behind the sheer curtain- apparently I'm not the only one that didn't discover this on my own. Anyhow, I take this opportunity to mention the crumbs and the sunflower kernels in the room. The man apologizes, and I express that I am just concerned that my sheets are not clean. He offers another room, but I tell him it 's okay.So, I go back to my room and decide to take a bath. That's when I notice that the bath tub is dirty. I decide at that point that I need another room. I go back to the front desk and tell the guy I need a new room. He says to go back to my room and he will call me in 10 minutes. I go back, but he never calls. In the meantime I start examining the room. I discover that the shower doors have not been cleaned. There is a bug dead in the shower door tracks. The entertainment center has not been wiped down and there are coffee rings and sugar and cream dust all over the top. There are icky dirt spatters on the floor boards, even the electrical sockets have spots of crud and worse yet, I find a curly black pube and an eyelash where I would normally rest my head and a stain on one of the pillows.So, I head back to the office...Long story short. He says he will give me a new room. I go to new room. Key doesn't work. I'm told I'm ""doing it wrong""- which I wasn't doing it wrong. This continues 3 trips with me alone, 2 trips with the desk guy and 1 trip with the owner. The internet goes out and the cable TV.  Almost an hour and half passes before I am put in a room. Then it turns out they are unable to key the keys at all, so I now can not leave my room or I will be locked out. The owner gets involved and is very kind, apologizing over and over and then tells me to call the 800 number and find out why the internet doesn't work... I look at him like he's crazy and he insists I keep $20 cash and apologizes. He shows off the room upgrades and turns on a light that illuminates the head board. I can't figure out how to turn light off the entire night and no one is at the front desk to help me. I have to sleep with the lights on all night until 5AM when a front desk person comes to my room and finds the switch to turn the light off. I didn't even try the continental breakfast.. too scared of what it might be. All in all, everyone was really nice, but I did not get what I paid for. I have stayed at Motel 6s that were cleaner with better amenities- and I'm not saying that to be cruel. I suggest spending less money on jacuzzi tubs and back-lit head boards and have a cleaning service take care of the bedding. Priorities!We were sent here to stay as their sister property was booked out for part of our stay... we were so pleasantly surprised with this property also, being a very nicely maintained hotel right across the ""Thunder mountain"" We enjoyed the view from the poolside and hung out all day in their wonderful pool. Loved the breakfast, which we ate at the patio, hearing the early morning bird chirps. Great friendly and helpful staff! The rooms had indirect lights over the head board... so romantic!! Very neat and modern look to furniture and decor. They had charging stations for modern gadgets anywhere you sat in the room making it easy for us to work on bed or the desk at night!One more hotel on my favorite place to stay in this cute town!!Nice upgrades!  Peaceful environment. Front desk staff were helpful, price was good for the night we stayed. In_room Jacuzzi was delightful, also included fridge and microwave with room. highly recommend.Great hotel. Nice rooms and free continental breakfast. The room is kind of old - the bathroom is tiny and the sink is by the door. The front door is hard to latch and there aren't a lot of blankets, but the room is really nice otherwise and the staff is super nice. I think overall it is a good value for the price.For the rate we paid in Sedona this place was a gem. We lucked into a $120 rate on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend.Comfortable beds, simple lay out, great service. Brand new carpet and bathrooms. The rooms are very nice and modern. Great work on the remodel! And the tubs have the nice tile work. The breakfast (no longer provided by most hotels) was a Continental+ which was a surprise. Nowadays, Continental means all-cold pastries or toast and coffee. This Continental had egg and cheese biscuits and waffles. Not that this is the most amazing breakfast feature EVER, but when you're expecting 'Continental' it was a pleasant surprise.My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The Vice President was on campus, the staff was very helpful, friendly, and responsive to  our needs. The VP congratulated us personally on our new marriage, and wished us the best- even called our room personally to clarify that everything was fine. If you don't stay here, you're not experiencing the ultimate in customer service, convenience in location, and a great overall experience. The rooms are beautiful, the pool and spa are wonderful,  and the property itself is just beautiful!The room was recently renovated, very comfortable. For the price, would stay again. The staff was great and gave great recommendations for dinner, hikes and horseback riding. The continental breakfast was nothing great but did the trick.First thing first, they call themselves a ""Hotel"", this is a ""Motel"" at best.  I expected so much more for the price I was paying. The pool is small and does not look like it gets daily attention. There are few anemities.  They are in the process of renovating which is commendable, but call it what it is, a ""Motel"".  It is obvious this structure has been here many years, worn and damaged stairways. Cracks between the walkways and building. The door to the room appears to have been damaged and repaired several times, the hardware was loose. Second day, ran out toilet paper and there was no spare (?). The continental breakfast was okay, very clean. Would like to see more fresh fruit, there was only one, very ripe banana. One more positive, the beds were comfortable.  I was very disappointed with this place. I fault no one but myself. This place was the only one available for the dates I needed on all the Hotel searches.  Apparently there was a reason for that. I should have lowered my search to Motels, I'm sure I would have found something better for the price.",,,,"['coming', 'trip', 'familiar', 'keep', 'things', 'straightforward', 'uptown', 'west',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/desert-quail-inn-sedona,Desert Quail Inn,4.0,$,40,"I can see why the Desert Quail is so highly ranked on Trip Advisor!  Everything about this little place was awesome.  The man who worked the front desk the entire time during our stay was extremely friendly and very helpful.The rooms are a little older but we had no problems with that.  The room was very clean and we had zero problems with anything in our room.  Our room had wonderful shower pressure and consistent hot water.  I have zero negative things to say about my stay here.  I would recommend this motel to anyone visiting Sedona for any length of time.This location might not be for everyone since it's a little down the road from the main drag in Sedona.  Since most people have a rental car while visiting Sedona I don't see that as a negative.  If you're looking for a hotel to be able to walk to and from while visiting the main drag this motel wouldn't work for you.We found this hotel on TripAdvisor; we were a little surprised when we drove in to see it looked like a budget motel. But the rooms are nice inside, having been remodeled fairly recently. Definitely stay on the second floor if you are a light sleeper because you can hear everything on the first floor(which is pretty typical).The king bed was a little firm for my taste but it was spacious. The pillows were a little small. There was a fridge and a microwave, an ironing board and an iron. The toilet was really loud--don't flush in the middle of the night! The water pressure in the shower was good, which was not the case in a lot of the restrooms around town.The staff was very accommodating, efficient, and friendly. This is a very well run hotel!If you've never been to Sedona, be aware that this hotel is actually in Oak Creek, a tiny community 5 miles outside Sedona, so it takes a few minutes to get into town. FYI I would definitely recommend this hotel!Very clean and very stylish for the price. Gabby was most helpful with anything needed...great customer service. Highly recommended...I'll be staying here again!Nice rooms and cheap. The bathroom door hit the toilet when you try to open or close it which was odd and the toilet was very loud. The woman at the front desk when we checked in wasn't very friendly. Wasn't patient with us and was more interested in getting us out the door than helping us, even though we were the only ones there.Overall not a bad place to stay. Coffee pot with coffee, tea and hot chocolate was in the room and the bed was nice and big. Pillows were a bit small for the size of the bed. Definitely recommend brining your own pillow.My wife and I stayed here over the July 4th 2015 holiday weekend and were very pleased. The prices were reasonable even during the holiday. Our ""king room"" (205) was large, clean, and have everything we needed. Upon check-in they even gave us a coupon to use for a discount on our Pink Jeep Tours! Also, it is located in a convenient location with plenty of shops, places to eat, and nice scenic views. The only downfall, in my opinion, is there is no free wifi or decent television channels to watch. I mean there was essentially only infomercials to watch all day and night.UPDATE !!STILL 1 STAR THOUGH My hubby n i stayed with a friend instead of this  awful hotel room,so we went back in morning to get previous managers info along with the REAL owners contact info just for us to actually meet the owner! Pretty interesting since we were told he was India in less than 12 hours prior from that awful lying manager. Come to find out The ""manager "" LIED to her owner to cover her ass by leaving a note about us trying to get a FREE upgrade after being in our room for over 30 minutes !! We were absolutely appalled by this experience! I had asked him to even look on any cameras to prove i had my credit card to pay her and he then claimed there's no cameras in lobby or property !! So its also an unsafe property! Anything could happen to their guests and nothing would be seen !! This owner ""nick bhakta"" wouldn't give out his name nor his employees name for us to report him n her . He gave his name as other guests were coming into the lobby. Its very unfortunate there are owners like this that actually were allowed to open up a business. The negativity will spread worst than wildfires. The owner showed us he had pink eye and thats why he was gone at the dr. Yesterday.... well now we know desert quail inn is nothing but false hopes. BE AWARE ! EVERY OTHER HOTEL AND INN IN SEDONA IS BETTER THAN THIS PLACE !!First, I really appreciate the owners/managers working with us.  Less than 48 hours ahead of our reservation, our plans changed, and we wanted to have our 1 night stay a night earlier.  They were willing to make the change, but they did not have any more rooms with 2 Queen beds.  We had to take two rooms with King beds.  With two older kids, that turned out to be a better arrangement.As far as the rooms, the layout was roomy, and a each room had a gas fireplace.  The linens were fresh, soft and comfortable.  The towels were soft and absorbent.  However, on the negative side, the beds were very firm, which none of us are use to, so we did not sleep well.  Also, the cable/dish TV was horrible.  After Sedona rolls up its sidewalks at 5pm, there wasn't much else to do except attempt to watch television.  Regardless of the channel, the image constantly froze, or temporarily changed channels.It was a nice enough hotel. It's a little far from downtown Sedona- about 10-15 min drive, but close to Bell Rock and some other  nice hiking points. The room was clean and modern. Reasonably priced, friendly guy working the counter. The only things I could say that weren't good were: the halogen lighting, the super loud flushing toilet haha, and the lumpy pillows. That shouldn't stop you from staying, it was nice.Room was spacious and clean, bed comfortable. There is a fridge and microwave. Behind the motel is a grocery store which was convenient. We were in room 205 and it was very quiet. The cons... The toilet made a loud noise when flushed (I would not want to have had the room below us). If you are scent sensitive you might have a hard time when you first open the room. When the heater first came on I  thought a train was going by but I got used to it.It was snowing when we were here so I didn't try the pool. Wifi good. No breakfast. Outside of Sedona and close to hiking trails. There was a loveseat in the room so if you're watching tv you don't have just the bed to sit on. Everybody seemed friendly. Great place to stay if you're looking for a less expensive place.Very clean, comfortable bed, great service you can tell the manager takes pride in keeping the property clean. Also rooms were recently updated.Arrived in Sedona for our first time and during check in were hoping the receptionist would've been a little more knowledgeable of the area and give us a few pointers, but she wasn't interested.  We had a room upstairs and they do not have elevators.  The room was clean and had a nice couch and table to sit at.  Positives: fridge, sink separate from the bathroom, quiet hotel, clean rooms.  The hotel has 1 ice machine and it is located by the pool.  The free wifi worked well too.I was really looking for a nice place to stay in Sedona, and wasn't looking for golf or the spa.  This place was perfect for a quick 1 night stay and there were only two minor things I didn't like.  1- It is a little ride to downtown Sedona, about 6 miles North on the Scenic Byway (Hwy 179)2-The rooms were all renovated except for the shower (old 80s prefab fiberglass).  Why they would do such a good job with everything else but leave the bathtub/shower untouched was beyond me.  Other than those two small complaints the room was excellent; comfortable and clean.Pros: There was a ceiling fan with a remote in our room! This was great, when was the last time you have seen a ceiling fan in a motel/hotel room? I could not think of any!There was DIRECTV with the individual tuner with HD.  Sweet.  Not that we used it much but still.  And lastly, there was a very nice gas log fireplace with a remote, this would cone in handy in the fall/winter.  Too warm to use on our May trip, but a nice addition.I would consider staying here again if I was back in Sedona, it was a great value! Oh and I had a great bagel for breakfast in Sedona at the NY Bagels &amp; Deli, nice place to grab a quick bite since the Motel does not have breakfast.Excellent place to stay. Very clean room and manager was very pleasant!I would definitely recommend this place!!!Nice clean place to stay.  Worth the $89 we paid for sure. Quick and easy check in. Lots of free movies on HBO. Small pool but unfortunately no hot tub. Nice comfortable beds. Fridge, microwave and coffee maker is useful. I enjoyed the hot chocolate with the usual coffee and tea.We opted for the king suite. Huge room and hot tub plus a fire place even though we didn't use it. There is some painting that needs to be done but it's 20 dollars more than the regular room?? So if you want a big comfy bed, reclining chairs and a hot tub, stay here it's so affordable and close enough to everything. Plus there's a cafe and grocery store 1 minute away, on foot.It was definitely worth the value. Located near shopping, hiking trails and eateries. The room was clean and spacious. The staff was helpful and made suggestions on places to dine. Definitely recommend.My husband and I stayed here for one night. It has everything you expect and then some. The inn is roughly 15 min from downtown sedona but the hotel tax and city tax is cheaper then staying in Sedona proper. We would stay here again if we came back through town.My boyfriend and I wanted to take a trip to Sedona and stay for a night (we live a few hours away in Phoenix). He said he stayed here before and knows how picky I can be with hotels (ha) so he recommended this hotel for me! The room is beautiful! Huge bed, giant tv, and oh did I mention the extravagant hot tub in the room?!?! Absolutely loved this little gem and will stay here anytime we come up! Also, there is a great breakfast place next door and an awesome restaurant across the street.  We will be back soon!What a pleasant surprise the DQI was. We were expecting a budget motel when we drove up - in fact, I was wondering what other reviewers were smoking when they wrote such glowing reviews. But, WOW!! The property is your typical motor inn, but all of the rooms have been refinished quite nicely. Nice carpets, excellent decor and crown mouldings throughout. The king size bed was SOOOO comfortable! A real oasis, after a day in the summer heat. The management are excellent, calling us not long after check in to ensure that there wasn't anything else that they could help us with or if we had any questions. I was also grateful that they heeded our request for a room overlooking the Red Rocks. Beautiful!The main tip I would give travellers is that the DQI is in Oak Creek, which was about 10-12km from the main Sedona strip. We drove into Sedona, which was no big deal - indeed, we preferred to make the drive, as it is along the gorgeous Red Rocks Scenic Byway (SR 179) - what scenery! I rather preferred it this way!The only request I would have for a future stay is if they could invest in some large pillows more appropriate for a king size bed. There were like six little Chicklets - though definitely not a showstopper for me or most travellers.Stayed for 2 nights and it was fine, but after reading such rave reviews I really did expect more.  I would call it an OK value for the price, but we could have stayed at the Days Inn down the road for almost half the cost &amp; I'm sure it would have been just fine as well.  No breakfast, which of course we knew beforehand, and the computer connection (not even talking wifi) was horrendous.  I couldn't even check my email.  The room was in OK condition, but frankly, could have used a little work.  Wasn't thrilled to pull up at 11pm to find our room keys taped to the office door with a note.  I was told that if we were going to arrive before 10, I should call (which I did) and someone would be there (which they were not).  It was ""fine,"" but I doubt I'd stay again.","This was the best budget motel experience I've ever had, and my rating is based on the type of place it is. For under $100/night I got a king bed, sofa, large room, gas fireplace, fridge, microwave, flat screen and wifi. I had been staying at a place up the street that had a more of a view, but was $40 a night more. Who stays in their room in Sedona to see the sights anyhow?  The room had been recently renovated and was very clean. The location was great, in Oak Creek out of the thick of the tourist area, next to a cafe, supermarket, and plenty of other things within walking distance including an outlet mall. The owners were friendly and you could see people around the properly working. There is a pool, although it wasn't open for the season yet. I would definitely stay here again if I returned to Sedona.Very clean, quiet, perfect location. Would definitely go back. Great location to hike Bell Rock, Devil's Bridge, &amp; more.I searched for an affordable yet nice place to stay in Sedona and came across Desert Quail Inn on Yelp. My boyfriend and I stayed here on 11/8 for my birthday and were very happy with our choice! The room was GREAT! Very clean, modern, and quiet! The jacuzzi tub and the fireplace in the room were so relaxing. The staff was very friendly.The Red Rock Cafe is right behind the Inn, takes just a second to walk there, and is the highest rated cafe in Oak Creek! Delicious breakfast! I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends!Everything you could want in a budget motel; and then some.  I don't know about you but when I am on vacation it is all about the sights; NOT the room I am staying in.  As long as the room is clean, has my basic needs covered and I feel safe I am happy. C'mon; when you are in beautiful Sedona who wants to waste time hanging out in your room anyway?We booked our room online based soley on the reviews and were not disappointed.  Our room was extremely clean and had a king sized bed with a very comfy, yet firm mattress. We also had a sofa, gas fireplace, ceiling fan, wi-fi, flat screen tv, microwave, fridge, hair dryer, iron and a HUGE wooden wardrobe closet that I thought was a nice touch.  All that and a friendly, informative front desk staff for a mere $100 a night. Count me satisfied.The place is just outside downtown Sedona so you don't have the traffic issues to deal with.  There are several restaurants, a local pub, an outlet mall, and a grocery store all within walking distance.  You are a mere 5 minute drive away from Bell &amp; Courthouse Rock as well as multiple other trails. I would absolutely go back next time I am in town.Went there for my husbands B-day weekend. Prices were reasonable and they rooms were very nice. We upgraded to the fireplace room for only $10more and it was remodeled and clean. Would definitely stay there again. Close to uptown Sedona but you need to drive. Beautiful Red Rock views with the second floor rooms. Also Desert Quail is in walking distance to IGA store and coffee shop.So glad it had a little re-do on that awful decor rom before.It is a decent place, good location, nice view, overall ok.If you need anything extra and have to call to ask, you have my warning, they don't seem to like it.Comfortable.  Clean.  Friendly and helpful host.   Reasonable cost.  Outdoor pool.  And you can walk to Red Rock Cafe which has awesome breakfasts.We stayed here one night. The place was nice for the money and very clean. I would stay here again. The room came with a microwave and a mini fridge.Nice friendly staff. Decent looking hotel. Relatively clean, dirty floors, but that's to be expected with these types of resorts.The reason for the 3 star review is that the beds we slept on were hard as cement. In fact, I honestly think the floor would have been more comfortable. We managed to finally get to sleep but being in our 30's we woke up quite sore. The views do make up for the beds, pretty much...Great experience! Particularly for the price; nice surprise how cute the room was, even with crown moulding. Loved that it wasn't in the middle of Sedona! Much better being down the road some. Plus the drive from Oak Creek to Sedona is the best in the entire area so totally worth it. Finally, an awesome Cafe for breakfast is behind the Inn as well as a great grocery store. All worked out great. Very pleased.I needed a flop house for a layover in Sedona, and the Desert Quail Inn more than hit the mark. The motel's recently been renovated, and the rooms are quite attractively furnished, comfortable, and clean. The staff are also extremely friendly (which is always a plus, but became an even bigger one after staying later on the trip in another Sedona-area hotel).My super-cheap $79 king room offered a refrigerator, a microwave, a totally awesome shower head, and a comfortable (if slightly hard for my pillowtop-owning self) memory-foam-topped mattress. Bonus points for a quiet A/C with an even quieter sleep mode and actual temperature settings measured in degrees.I'd gladly stay in the Desert Quail Inn again without a second thought. It's easy to find in Oak Creek, and I don't have a bad thing to say about it.Great decor, memory foam on the king size bed, DirecTV, great shower, easy to find, nice views of the red rocks and a very nice staff. Plus it's  $70 a night? What more can you ask from a budget hotel? The front desk guy was super cool too. If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to super expensive hotel rooms in the heart of Sedona, then this is it. One caveat, it is in a suburb of Sedona which means that you do have to drive ~15 min to get to downtown Sedona. (I know who knew that Sedona had a suburb right? Love you Sedona!)My husband and I stayed here for the night and spent the extra money to get the jaccuzi room. Not only did our room have a jaccuzi but also had a big LCD tv with direct tv, a beautiful gas fireplace, refrigerator, microwave, coffee pot, cozy four post bed, couch, 2 recliners .. just amazing! Very clean room. I think this might be a family owned hotel. The staff is very friendly and told us about a few places to eat that they recommend. They made sure to let us know if we had any questions they were there to help. Free WiFi just ask for the password at check in. There is a grocery store and cafe just a few steps away. They have a pool that's a bit small but serves the purpose for cooling off. When you get a hotel room in Sedona it's never really cheap but this place was very reasonable especially being right in the heart of Sedona and all it tourist attractions. Definitely recommend and will visit again!This place was just fine for our 2-night stay in Sedona.  The room was clean and large.  It had a small fridge which came in handy to cool our water before going on our hikes.  (It was 80+ degrees.)  No complaints except that the bed was hard and you had to slam the door to lock it.  Pool on-site so bring bathing attire.  Outlet stores located across the street.  Cafe next door at Red Rock Coffee.  Plenty of restaurants within walking distance.Great little place to stay! Clean, roomy, big beds, refrigerator &amp; microwave...Nick, at the front desk was kind and very helpful. We weren't here long, but would stay again if we're ever in the area.This is the hotel that I stayed in when first to Sedona.  I thought I had booked into a Quality inn, but discovered this was a Quail inn.  Oh well!The rooms were clean, the pool was small, but enjoyable, the views were terrific, the price was cheap, and I had a little fridge.Other than that, it was all about hiking on the red rock.  If I were on a tight budget, I'd stay here again.  Otherwise, I might spend a tad more and sleep at the Kings Ransom.Nice, clean, simple hotel....  and for the price it is AMAZING. Good size rooms that look recently renovated. Staff was friendly. Location of the hotel is just outside of Sedona. View of Red Rocks is awesome. My wife and I walked around the area and found it very nice and safe. Would definitely go back to this hotel.Why 5 stars. Very, very nice room, very, very low price.  Clean, big room, everything you could want without high price. Best deal I've ever gotten on a room.Nice views, decent prices, very pleasant staff - don't expect the same atmosphere as the Hilton but I would stay here again.This place was great for the price, we payed about 60 bucks for a night without reservation, the rooms where decent sized, beds where comfortable, customer service was superb, ""Red"" I believe was the guy working there he was really nice, all in all it was great.  The pool was closed but we didn't mind because it was really cold, we only needed to stay there for the night because our campsite was freezing.",,,,"['see', 'desert', 'quail', 'highly', 'ranked',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/matterhorn-inn-sedona,Matterhorn Inn,3.5,$$,24,"We had a wonderful stay in the Matterhorn Inn. Great location for visiting the area and the Grand Canyon and it's right in the heart of Uptown Sedona, so shops and restaurants are a short walk away. We stayed in Room 39, on the second floor (first floor for Europeans) and paid an average of $180/night plus tax. The room was large, bright and clean. Great shower and lots of room for toiletries in the bathroom area. And the view - wow! We kept the curtains open all night so we could wake up to views of the red rocks from bed. We would return in a heartbeat to Sedona and the Matterhorn Inn.Clean and simple. I really like the layout and how the bed faces the balcony overlooking downtown Sedona. Blow dryer, coffee maker, closet with full length mirror, decent size tv. Little pricey but I think it was a busy season. Front desk gave us a coupon to a few restaurants in the area to compensate for not having a continental breakfast.This place was not what i expected. On the website they make it sound very nice and pet friendly. It was not very pet friendly at all!!! They have all these charges for pets and got kind of snippy when we told them we had animals. Also the lady at the front desk was not very nice at all or helpful when asking directions or recommendations.Also they said they had a dog park in walking distance,it was not in walking distance at all! We had to drive to it. The beds were very small,on the site it said king, they were not they were double it seemed like!!Overall this place was very disappointing,especially on our last day of vacation!! They were rude and messed up on charging on our credit cards. They were the same price as a residence inn or fairfield. I wouldve rather gone back to flagstaff and gone there!Basically if youre looking for an overpriced room that is not that nice then here is your type of place. However it did have a good view of the mountains and it was in the middle of all the shops. Go here if youre going to be out of your room and there is no other place that has rooms.What a great property. I travel throughout the United States and stay always at branded hotel chains this is a little gem in the hills. I've been to Sedona many times and was lucky enough to find this place. I would recommend this place to anyone. The rooms have gorgeous views of the rocks.We had a very pleasant experience at the Matterhorn Inn January 30 - February 1, 2015!  We were in town for the Sedona Marathon event.  From the time I made my reservations last spring to check-out on Sunday, the service was wonderful!  I called the staff occasionally before arrival to check on the temperature and suggestions for the marathon.  Once we checked in, we went to the room.  We stayed in Room 41, which we will request in the future.  The heater was on and the room was toasty warm, which was a very nice treat since we had been driving for several hours in the rain.  The view from the balcony in both directions was absolutely stunning. Sedona has got to be the most beautiful place God created on the planet.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  While in town, we enjoyed the coffee, protein shakes and pastries at Theia's Coffee House which was recommended by the Matterhorn Staff and is right across the parking lot from the hotel.  Kari is amazing!  We also enjoyed Mexican food and margaritas at Javelina Cantina.  We are planning a hiking trip in the future and will stay at the Matterhorn Inn, have coffee at Theia's, and dinner at Javelina Cantina.  We will also try the Hike House to plan some hikes for us.  Thank you Matterhorn Inn!!  You have customers for life!!  Blessings!!This place is nothing special, just an ordinary motel.  However, it was clean and comfortable and conveniently located near restaurants and shops.  With the AAA rate, it is very reasonably priced.  Ask for a room on the second floor to enjoy the views from the patio!This place did the job.  Great view right out on to the Red Rocks and tourists shopping along 89A.  Host at counter was kind.  Room was clean, sufficient, and had a nice TV.Very handy to tourist area.  Got a nice rest here.We came in from the Grand Canyon on our way home to Tempe and only planned to stay the afternoon. Once we got close the views kicked in and we then wanted to stay the evening. I checked <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>, hotwire, hotel tonight and none had a room within 10 miles of city center. Sucks. We also had a pup with us so that made things rough also.We get into town, park, and start our trek through uptown and stumbled upon this little Inn with awesome views and prime location. Went in to ask if they have any rooms, had one, pet friendly $170. Boom. Done. Room 22, first floor for the pup and a great balcony with stunning views. At check in we were told all the places of interest and was also given a great map to get us around town.Our overall experience was excellent and it was a great time in Sedona. Our next trip we WILL be staying at this Inn again. Thank you.LOCATION is the key and this is what Matterhorn Inn has the edge over the other places. In the heart of uptown Sedona where all the overpriced gift shops and restaurants are. You get to have a nice vista of the mountain from your room balcony. The decor in the room is simple and a bit outdated. The plastic potted plants are a complete waste of space and has to go!Bed is comfy with a mattress topper. Flat screen tv with cable, complimentary wi-fi for all the guests. Ample parking space available and free of charge.Housekeeping did a good job of keeping the room clean and at the same time changing our towels throughout our stay.The place is convenient and has easy access to food and shops.Our room was really stinky, we had to drive a few miles to purchase a scented disinfectant. For $150/night, it sure was a very unpleasant stay.Great location, fantastic views of mountains. One of the lower priced motels in Sedona.Large room with balcony.Very small bathroom; toilet &amp; bathtub very tight and close together; outdated fixturesVery thin interior walls - 2 neighboring TVs (next room and directly beneath) could be heard at once. Keeping the air conditioner on 'fan' throughout the night produced a loud but constant white noise effect that effectively drowned out outside sound.Exterior walls good - no traffic noise from busy street could be heard, but muffler-less motorcycle in the parking lot was enough to wake the deadWi-fi is provided but spotty; kept going in and out. Could be because of location of room - top floor on end; might be better in other rooms.Our room was spacious and clean, with an amazing view. The bathroom was tiny, but manageable. No complaints about the room comfort or decor. It could be a little bit noisy, but we were there in January, and since everything in town closes down by 9 PM, it's quite quiet after that. Our biggest complaint was the hot tub. For outdoor temperatures in January, the hot tub isn't nearly warm enough. When we got in, it felt lukewarm, and we were freezing when we got out. Not a pleasant experience at all. When we mentioned it to the young guy at the desk the next day, he told us something about rules that require them to keep it no hotter than a certain temperature. He offered to check it for us, but who knows if he ever did. (The hot tub seemed to be the same lukewarm temperature the next night.) The girl at the desk was very friendly and helpful. When we told her about it the day we checked out, she at least seemed genuinely concerned, wrote down our comments, and said she would speak to the management about it. We told her we thought it wasn't even worth having a hot tub if it couldn't be warmer. And if they are following some rule, they seem to be the only ones in the area following it!We appreciated daily maid service. But one day we stepped out for a half an hour to grab a coffee, and when we returned to the room at 10 AM, there was a note on our door telling us that made service was done for the day. Really? 10 AM? That seems awfully early. It wasn't a huge deal to us, but at the end of our stay we decided not to leave the maid our usual tip.In general, it's a pleasant place, with a great location, especially for the price, if you don't care about having a hot tub.There was a small gaggle/family/herd of about 100 gnats in one of my washcloths. They happened to migrate into my sink. There was a small fly in one of my bath towels. I'm sorry, I expect clean towels... At least ones that don't have insects in them. The staff was pretty receptive after I showed them my pictures. Offered me $10 off. I declined. The view was nice........ It's in a good location. Parking and wi-fi are free... and hey.. you can always use another towel, yes?I would say for what this is, it is great!The room:The rooms are always clean, and well done.  Meaning they are always clean, and made when we get there as well as vacuumed. I will say there are few rooms, and they are all accessible from the street, making them not as secure. The things that are missing, are a room safe, and a microwave.The ambiance:It is more like a motel type thing, but the view is excellent!  You see one of he mountains out of your balcony sliding glass door.The Front Desk staff:Are always friendly, and helpful!Security:I would say poor, but crime has been low in this part of town, and the Matterhorn consistently gets good reviews.  The Amenities:I would say non existent, with the exception that they do in fact have free wi-fi in the rooms, and it is amazingly fast.The Price: I would say right on.  Even cheap for this end of Sedona.  Everything is within walking distance.This update has absolutely everything to do with management, and nothing at all with the quality of rooms. I'm so upset we just had the experience that we did, because I was certain this would be the place we went back to time and time again.Last time we visited, we stayed for 5 days and had a terrific experience (per above). This last Friday we decided to make a last minute trip up just for Saturday night, and called to make reservations. They offered us the same room we had previously since we enjoyed it so much. Great!Halfway up from our drive from Phoenix, we get a call from the front office saying they've had another guest requesting the same room, but they want to stay three nights. Their three nights trumps our one night even though we booked first. Fine. Disappointing and not very professional, but fine. Not the end of the world. We accept a different room. If our problems had stopped there, our experience would have been perfectly fine. We arrived very early, around 9:30am. We didn't expect to be able to check in that early, so instead we just filled out the paperwork and tried to pay. Per the Matterhorn's preference, they had not finished billing for the previous night and did not want our payment to be on the wrong day's report. They asked us to pay later. Again, no problem, we had a credit card on file with them which they could always charge at any time.We left and went about our day. After they called to say the room was ready, we went back to get settled before our dinner reservations that night. A loud noise was coming from the room next door, but since neither of us were sleeping we decided to ignore it. Just after 6pm, they called the room and asked us to come down and pay now. Rushing to make our reservations in Oak Creek at 6:30, we forgot to stop at the office in our haste. At 11pm, we had been trying to sleep for an hour when the loud noise next door still hasn't stopped. I called the overnight service desk to report it, and was told ""yeah, okay we'll look into it"" by a man who sounded like he couldn't care less. The phone rang soon after we hung up but this time it was the female manager. As I tried to explain the situation to her, she rudely cut me off to say ""By the way, you're room isn't paid for. You never paid for it.""Excuse me? In every hotel I've ever stayed in, including hers, I have never been officially billed until checkout. We tried to pay early and they told us no. We take responsibility for forgetting earlier in the evening, but with a credit card on file and a record of on-time payment from past visits, is 11 o'clock at night when I am calling to report a disturbance really the best time to harp at me? I offered to come down to pay right then, but was told the office was closed. To make things even better, when we tried to pay (again) at checkout, we were told by the same woman that our card was charged last night. Whoa whoa whoa. It was charged last night? So either she took my head off for nothing when it was already paid for, or she opened the office in the middle of the night to charge it after we called. Either way, ridiculous. Apparently charging ahead of time is their policy for one-night-only stays. Thanks a lot for telling us.  I'll miss the view and the location, but they have made it clear we are not worth their time unless we shell out for a week's worth of accommodations.Clean reasonably priced room in a great location.  Would stay there again.  You can walk to most everything in Sedona from here.Convenience, comfort, and classic.  Beautiful views, fresh air, and a tiny taste of small luxury.The Matterhorn Inn has never ceased to please my fiance and I when we visit Sedona.  Most of the time when we stay, it is on a whim, and we select this place because of it's lower prices, awesome patio view, and its matter of convenience to the downtown area.If you are looking for class, than perhaps this is not the place for you.  Although the rooms are nice, they are basic, yet CLEAN.  Oddly enough, the bedding is very comfortable (I have difficult times sleeping in hotel beds) and provides a nice night's sleep to those in need.  Your room will have a small mini-fridge, coffee maker, blow dryer, etc. (all you basic stuff).  The bathroom is slightly smaller than I would expect,  but does have a window for outside in it at the top, which is useful for a steamy shower or steamy...well, you know what.I have stayed in both the regular room and pet room.  Surprisingly, the pet room does not have a funky oder to it as I imagined it would.  All pet rooms are located on the bottom floor.The view from your patio is the best thing about this place.  The patio is huge and gives amazing views to the red rocks and downtown area.  I can sit out there for hours and WISH that this is what I could do everyday. They also have a pool and spa available.  Keep in mind, the spa does not get super hot, which was a slight downfall, but at least it was relaxing late at night after walking all day.Management is always very nice here.  They want to make your stay as good as it gets.Location, location, location... This location is great! The room was clean, the view was beautiful, the lady that checked us in was very friendly and helpful. The only 4 drawbacks, was no microwave, no breakfast, the coffee pot was down low on shelf very inconvenient had to move it up on counter to use and the pot was plugged in under counter and it had a short cord, and lastly, the room had a odor of some kind and it never went away... We sprayed a nice room spray and it still overpowered the room spray, so don't know what the odor was. I would stay here again. Ask for upstairs rooms, better views, but if you have trouble with stairs there is no elevator. We enjoyed the hot tub it could use a little work. The last day as we were getting ready to leave, it was on Monday MLK day and the crew was using a jack hammer on the parking lot behind the Inn pretty early... Very noisy!Location location location!  This place is in the heart of Uptown Sedona and there are tons of shopping and restaurants within walking distances.  The drive to Cathedral rock was only ten minutes and the views from the room balcony were amazing..especially at sunset.  The room is clean and well maintained.  The people at the front desk, especially Melanie, were so incredibly nice.  The office is only open from 8 am - 10 pm, but this was not a big deal to us at all.  Highly recommended for the price which is about $135 per night not including taxes and you can't beat the location.Fantastic location with incredible view from private balcony (in every room).  Great friendly and helpful staff.  In the middle of downtown Sedona.  Couldn't ask for a better location.  Room was very clean, nicely sized with convenient mini-fridge (for storage of locally brewed beer).","The hotel was located right downtown, views were great and the room was clean but the ""Inn"" is really much like an old motel.  What made me give them a ""one star"" when I probably would have given a three is the service.  Both my friend and I left our iphone chargers in the room and called right away, we had plugged them in behind the TV so it could have been overlooked by the maid.  They were going to check for us, they didn't , we had to call back and then someone was in the room.  The clerk assured me the guests were checking out in the am and she would call me.  No call in the am, so I call and she says ""I TOLD YOU WE DID NOT FIND IT YESTERDAY"" in a rather bothered, irritated manner.  When I explained that someone had to look behind the TV she said (still irritated like she was talking to a child) well the guests did not check out so I'll call you tomorrow.  Losing an iphone charger is not the worst thing that can happen but it's about $45 to replace.  I live not far from the ""Inn"" and could have gone back for them.  For $190/night - off season, I would have at least expected someone could have walked the 20ft to our room (right outside the office) and made an effort to find our property or been nicer about it.  Can't they left a note for the guests to look behind the TV, or ask the maid when she cleaned to room to look?  How hard is that to do for a paying customer?   I would not go back....Good Location.  Great Views.  Small, Older rooms.  No extras.  Dbl beds.  2 levels: if @ lower level, you hear stomping around from above.  Old a/c units which are quite deafing, esp. when running all nite.  For $140 I was pissed! That gets you in Scottsdale = 5 star resort.  This was = Motel 6 or Holiday Inn.  Guess that's what you get if you want to stay in Tourist Town.We booked 2 nights at the Matterhorn Inn basically because it was the only decently reviewed place we could afford in Sedona. I must admit that I didn't have high expectations. Online it looked like a basic motel. And the name didn't help. Matterhorn? In Sedona?  (Never did learn why they named it that.) The reality is that the motel is very clean and maintained with a nice pool area and is in a fantastic uptown location. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a great view. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again. Give it the chance I almost didn't.My husband and I stayed at The Matterhorn Inn last weekend during our brief visit to Sedona.  The hotel is in a good part of town if you're into touristy shops and overpriced, underwhelming food, but the location is just about all it has going for it.  Our room wasn't exactly clean.  I found a pile of whiskers near the sink, hair stuck in the blow dryer, and hair stuck on our ""clean towels"".  Um -- gross.  I didn't look closely at the bedding for fear of what I might discover.  I've definitely stayed in nicer hotels, especially for the money.  Plus, the hotel lobby closes at 10pm, so, should you need anything after quittin' time, you're out of luck.",,,,"['wonderful', 'inn', 'great', 'location', 'visiting', 'area', 'grand', 'canyon',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/days-inn-sedona-sedona-2,Days Inn Sedona,3.5,$,27,"When you are on a long-awaited, ""hopefully not-just-once in a lifetime"" vacation/belated honeymoon, and/or visiting a BEAUTIFUL, one-of-a-kind, natural setting, and you can't quite get away with ""living off the land"" for a week, the next best thing to do is to find a good, clean, basic place to stay, and save your $$$ for the fun stuff.  That's EXACTLY what we did when we moved from our first semi-lap of luxury (not really) first hotel to this Days Inn.  And really, for what's it's worth, all things considered, this was as good, if not BETTER a place for us (and nearly $50.00/night cheaper than the first place!!)  SCORE!!!With a (rental) car, which you REALLY need if you plan to spend any amount of time in the area, there's really no ""bad"" location here in Sedona.  We wanted a pool and breakfast, and that's exactly what we got.  Quiet, comfortable, convenient, not far from any of what we wanted to see and do.  We had a upstairs room, private balcony overlooking the pool, with a comfy king-size bed, microwave, fridge, and not a care in the world.  Nope, this is not ""lap of luxury,"" and the breakfast area is small, and there aren't a ton of choices, but staying a week here was one of our better choices, and we'd do it again in a heartbeat... Unless, of course we a) win the lottery, or b) find the MOST perfect spot out in the wilderness!!  ;-)3 stars for ample space &amp; below. Has Bed room &amp; a separate front room.Decorations from the 1970's. In need of a face lift.If they would replace the ancient stained maroon carpets, out dated drapes and decor furnishings and would put in new heating  it would go along way... I would rate it 5 stars for what it is &amp; provides.It's a basic hotel. With not much on site.Room Does have a mini-frig/microwave.2 ; flat 32 inch tvs with limited channels.Not much amenities on site. (A pool for summer)A location that's good for sleeping...The free breakfast is toast, bagels, cereal and fruit.  Coffee or OJ. Located in a side room of check in area that has only 3 tables; so most likely you will take food to your room. Service to 9:30am. Great staff!!Heaters are old fashion and take and suck up all the oxygen in the room. Can only run them for a short while. FYI Room does have a tub. Housekeeping available daily.Good for those needing a place to sleep for the night or need to be cost effective. Yet perhaps may not be your 1st choice if you want to hang on site to experience the grounds or be inside the room to take in the ambiance for a long period of time. Rooms are cold but do warm up after a bit.If you are on a tight budget or w/kids then this may satisfy your needs.Great location if you are planning on hiking Thunder Mountain and the trails nearby. The bed was super comfy and overall very clean. Can't beat the price and what you get. Rooms are sizeable, has a frig, and while the walls are kind of thin, it's all good. The soap/towels are what you'd expect for a Days Inn so bring your own stuff as needed.They have a free breakfast with oatmeal, bagels/diff kinds of bread. Plenty of parking as well. I would definitely stay here again.Stayed here 3 nights with a deal from Hotwire, much cheaper than most other places in Sedona and we were happy to be away from all the noise in Uptown.Rooms were perfectly clean, great Wifi service and we enjoyed the pool. The continental breakfast provided included oatmeal, breads, cereal, yogurt, bananas,  juice and coffee. Quality wasn't great, but what you would expect for the type of hotel, we did eat there 2 of the mornings and it was ok. The coffee maker, microwave and mini fridge was a plus. We brought some drinks from home that we kept in the fridge and had popcorn with our HBO movies at night.I would not hesitate to stay here again, perfect for the budget minded traveler.Nice rooms and comfy beds. Be careful of the tile outside the building when it's wet. I took one step onto it and slipped and hit my face on the railing and took a massive chunk out of my tongue. Comical yet dangerous. They should really change the tile.Really nice place perfect placing little bit away from the busy down town.Beautiful red mountain in front of the room I was in.There is a patio to sit and enjoy the beautiful weather.The staff is wonderful and really helpful with what to do in the town and where to eat.The rooms were clean.free wifi.The bathroom are a little small but good for the price.Have been staying here for years and it's great! Fairly priced and not far from uptown. Staff is always friendly and the room(s) are always clean. The breakfast sucks and that's the only complaint. Highly recommend!Hey, what kind of traveller are you? If you're pretentious, or difficult to please then just stop reading now. But, if you're a little more easy going, want a quality, clean location-then this is a place for you! Let's not kid ourselves, Sedona is expensive. You can easily pay at least $125 a night at most places. Here, the cost is a little more reasonable (or use points!) and totally functional. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom clean, and the location-central. I totally recommend this stop for the money-wise traveler!I stay here over this past weekend with my mom when when we were in Sedona for a wedding. Overall, I was really happy with my stay at the Days Inn-Sedona. The best part about this place is that they keep the rooms very clean. I've stayed at other budget hotels/motels and they often skimp on cleanliness to keep costs down. This definitely wasn't the case at this location. Also, the WiFi was free and it worked great during our entire stay.The only negative that I can think of is that the bathrooms are incredibly small. So small that it was difficult to get in and out of at times. This normally wouldn't be a huge issue since I tend to not hangout in the bathroom when I'm on vacation, but it's the only private area of the room to change your clothes. Again, it wouldn't be an issue if I was staying there with my wife or by myself, but you definitely want a little privacy for changing your clothes when you're staying some place with your mom. Despite this relatively minor issue, I would definitely stay at the Days Inn-Sedona in the future.A bit disappointed. Bathrooms definitely need to be upgraded. Also buy some new towels.  Some of them were not clean and with spots on them and falling apart.Great price, clean, comfortable.Stayed here on a road trip and was very satisfied. Got a good deal through Hotwire and felt pleased with what we got. Beautiful area, lovely drive in. Room was spacious and clean with refrigerator and microwave. Bed was comfortable. Great deal.I don't expect a lot when I book a days inn.  The hotels in Sedona are all pretty expensive compared to other cities.  I booked out a month ago and had already paid for the room.  I called the receptionist to see if I could get an early check in because we were only an hour and a half out.  The receptionist sounded like a snotty teenager told me, ""well maybe by 2 pm but there is no guarantee whatsoever."" With that attitude we decided to cancel our reservation...I expect a little less rudeness with my booking.Ditto on many of the other positive reviews, thought I would add as an update to the most recent review that they seem to have ramped up the free breakfast offerings - there was an assortment of bagels, pastries, cereal, hardboiled eggs and more. We booked two rooms the night before our stay through Priceline express deals and were very pleased with the quality of what we got for the money ($79/room plus taxes and fees). The bathroom was quite small but there was a nice showerhead and good water pressure. Our rooms were on the second floor and we had a great  little private balcony facing one of the red rocks. Cable wise there were a plethora of channels including HBO. My teeny tiny complaint is that we were not able to check in early. Regular check in time is 3:00 and when I called at around 1:30 the rooms had not yet been cleaned. Overall we really enjoyed our stay, the area seemed more residential than other parts of Sedona and there's lots of restaurants. Also located not too far from the airport if you're looking to do a helicopter tour.The location of this hotel is ideal. They are right in the center of Sedona. When we arrived five minutes before 3 (check in time) the lady yelled at my mom for wanting to check in early and it would be another 20 minutes later. I was very offended she had to yell at my mother for just asking when our room would be ready. We mentioned we would be right outside to wait. Another staff member told us it was ready and the lady just said it has been a busy day. Sadly though, that was not a reason to yell at my mom and not even say sorry. On the other hand, the morning staff seemed super friendly and very happy to be working there. The room was spacious and very tidy. It does seem to be a little date with its art decor, but who care right? I enjoyed its large screen, mini fridge and microwave as we had bought some goodies from Cottonwood. The breakfast options were OK. One type of cereal, bread, a banana and a pastry are your only options. I would have thought some fresh fruits would have been more ideal but it's free so I'm fine with the options.  If you have kids they will be begging for more options. Overall it's a great place, it just depends who get at the front desk and if they yell at you.For value alone, this Days Inn is astounding!Inexpensive lodging that isn't slummy is hard to find in Sedona. Days Inn is clean as a whistle, with a moderate size room and convenient amenities. There is a fridge, microwave, and cable tv. There is a pool open during the summer months and a jacuzzi which was really nice for a chilly November night. I liked the location. I prefer west Sedona over the cheesy touristy area. Days Inn is located nearby better, more local restaurants and close to some good hiking.There was a good selection of items for the continental breakfast. I personally don't like continental breakfasts because of the major carb overload. It would have been nice to see some yogurt or even some hard boiled eggs or something.When we want to splurge on a super romantic Sedona trip, we will not be going to Days Inn. But when we are on a budget and need to get a Sedona fix, this is where you will find us!We are going to call this one bedroom home.$140. It has a king bed and a giant flat screen with HDMI so I can stream onto our TV from my PC which is connected to the free WiFi. And for the couples wishing to enjoy discrete moments of pleasure under the bright stars of the endless sky, in the jacuzzi and maybe a bottle of wine, with romantic beauty, they got that.Good location, great for the price but the lady at the front desk was SUPER rude. I asked for an extra sheet and blanket since our room was originally suppose to have two beds but instead had one king sized. She actually said to me ""Just what are we trying to do here?"". After arguing with her she finally got off her bum and got me one.Great place to stay at a reasonable rate. The rooms are in excellent repair.  Staff was friendly.  Everything is nice and clean.  It is in the middle of town, right near everything. Very safe area.  Would have given  stars but the free breakfast was  bit weak.  Not a lot of room for people to eat, so it was packed. Other than that, it was nice.What outstanding service and accommodations.  The hotel is clean and rooms are adequate.   I love the two Door entrance and private balconies.  Nobody running in front of your main window.  Not bad for 114 a night!!Great hotel - super friendly and helpful staff, spacious &amp; clean room w/ fridge, microwave, free wifi. Free breakfast, comfy bed, quiet. Stayed here for the Sedona Marathon; it's walking distance from the starting line. Got the cheapest room available and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was. They even let me check out at noon instead of 11 to give me time to walk back and shower after the race (I just asked at breakfast).Location is great - easy to get to stuff, but not right in the middle of the more hectic and touristy parts of town. I highly recommend this hotel.","Well, the room is nice. Location great. I booked the room through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a>, that is another story. Hotwire's map &amp; directions are sooooo  wrong to get to this location.My family stayed here during labor day weekend. The front desk ladies were very friendly and polite. The room was suprising large and clean with a LCD tv and free wireless internet. The only downside was the microscopic bathroom. Overall, the experience was amazing for the price. Highly recommended.For Sedona, this hotel is a great value and in a decent location.  The room was very clean and the staff friendly. The pool was also very nice, and warm too!  The continental breakfast is a bit on the light side but the overall value of the hotel outweighed this somewhat minor inconvenience.  I would definitely stay again!I didn't stay and wouldn't just because the reservation on site lady was so rude (9/2/12).  I called twice within 10 minutes and the second time when I said I was inquiring about a room for tonight, she said, ""what about it, I just talked to you"".  It doesn't matter if she talked to me 15 times - does it?  We paid $75 more to stay somewhere else just to avoid having to deal with them.We made a reservation by phone for this accommodation for part of the 4th of July weekend, planning to stay here for two nights while we get out of the heat in the Phoenix metro area.  We reserved with a credit card a suite with two rooms and two beds.  This morning, the day before we were to check in, we received a call from the desk clerk saying that they were canceling our reservation because the clerk who booked the room made a mistake and three adults and two children under 12 couldn't stay in that room.  And they could not provide us with a second room since they were completely booked.   But neither he nor the manager, Noa BanBaber made any attempt to put us up at another hotel to rectify THEIR MISTAKE!""  Instead, they took the easy way out and simply canceled our reservation and told us to go somewhere else.  Which will be a near impossibility at this late date in that resort city on this holiday weekend.  The manager said she ""would look into why the mistake was made"" as if that would solve the problem she created for us.  The clerk who called this morning was extremely apologetic but the manager was extremely defensive and refused to even acknowledge that Days Inn had any obligation to us, the consumer, by accepting a reservation made in good faith.  She bluntly told me that she and Days Inn had no obligation to us.......We stayed there a month ago and while a little tough to find, as it's in West Sedona, about 5 miles from uptown, it worked for us. Stopping for directions in one of those tourist info centers the people in front of us were told rooms start around $125 and we were only paying around $75. If we went back wouldn't hesitate staying there again.Apparently we had one of the best rooms in the property. The room was clean and fairly spacious. However, the bathroom was tiny. Free breakfast was OK (oatmeal, fruit, danishes). Linda @ the front desk was a sweetie and totally well-informed. I didn't like the threats printed out on table tents, in the form of menus of prices for various sizes of missing towels.",,,,"['long', 'awaited', 'hopefully', 'lifetime', 'vacation', 'belated',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/las-posadas-of-sedona-sedona,Las Posadas of Sedona,4.5,$$,24,"We've stayed at Las Posadas 4 times and really love this place! Each unit we stayed in had a gas fireplace, small kitchen area and was very clean and comfortable. The staff was always great and even gave us a discount for repeat business. They also ask ahead of time if anyone in the party had special food needs so that they could inform the chef for your breakfast each morning.  Counting the days until we can visit again!I really enjoyed my stay in Las Posadas, which is not far from Sedona. Like a number of other resorts and hotels in the area, it is actually in the Village of Oak Creek. Our unit was spacious and very clean, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The bathroom was huge and the king-size bed was very comfortable, and the suite had a sleeper sofa and the requisite microwave and small fridge, plus a Keurig coffee maker and coffee pods. Compared to chain hotels and resorts, this establishment as has a more quiet, secluded feel and is conveniently located near the first roundabout you reach on Route 179 on your way to Sedona from I-17. The complimentary breakfast in the dining hall was hearty, with tamales, egg, sausage, fresh fruit, yogurt, muffin, and granola. I would definitely recommend this place to friends planning to visit the Sedona/Oak Creek area.I'm only giving this place one star instead of zero because the facility itself was quiet and clean. It's unfortunate the staff is a COMPLETE nightmare.  A few days prior to arriving, I spoke to the concierge who informed me that check in was at 11am.  It was obviously a miscommunication because check in is not actually until 3pm.  When we arrived at 12:30 pm, we were greeted by a smug ""front desk manager"" named Britney.  AFTER taking my credit card, she informed us that check in was not until 3pm.  My boyfriend told her that we had planned our day based on the earlier check in time so if there was anything she could do to get us in a little sooner, we would really appreciate that.  She then smugly stated, ""check in is at 3.""  Knowing there was nothing we could do (even though it was their fault by telling us the wrong check in time) we decided to head out and enjoy the town until our room was ready.  She told us she would call us when the room was ready.  I then asked her what room we were in (for the simple reason that I wanted to drive by and see if we had a view) and she told me that they ""cannot disclose that information"" until we check in.  I said ""um, ok"".  She then says, ""you are welcome to stay somewhere else""...basically TELLING US TO LEAVE.  I was stunned since there was NO REASON for her rudeness.  My boyfriend (who previously worked in the hotel business for 15 years) asked her to speak to the manager.The ""hotel manager"", John, (who we found out, is the owners son) came out in a pair of shorts, sneakers, and a half tucked in shirt.  My boyfriend very calmly explained what had just happened and instead of apologizing and trying to rectify the situation, the ""manager"" told us that she is an amazing employee and we must have done something to provoke her to act that way.  I guess Mommy and Daddy had to give him a ""job"" since he would obviously never make it in the real world with those ""management"" skills.  Being that half of our trip was ruined already, we decided to still stay there and not go through the hassle of trying to book another room somewhere else, last minute.  We waited until 3:45 for them to call us to tell us when the room was ready, as she had told us she would do.  We never got any call and just showed back up.  The next morning, the lobby/office is supposed to open at 8am.  We were not able to check out until 8:40am when Britney decided to make an appearance at her job. After our departure, we attempted to call the ""manager"" again, since he was conveniently not available in the morning when we left.  We got no answer and no return call to the message we left him.  4 days later, he finally called us.  He did apologize and told us they are having major staff problems at the hotel so I'm not sure why he was such a wimp in front of his little girlfriend at the front desk.  He said he would send us a free stay to give them another try.  A month later and we havent received anything or heard from them at all.  At this point, you couldn't PAY ME to stay there ever again. STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!Our family loved our stay here.  First of all the staff was accommodating and nice we came in late and the front desk clerk walked us to our room.  The villa we stayed in was super clean and had a little kitchenette that came in handy.  It was really nice to wake up and walk over for a delicious breakfast every morning made by Chef Jeffrey.  The location was convenient.  We really enjoyed our time in the saltwater pool and spa.  The water in the pool was so soft.  We occasionally stopped by the office to grab a cookie (best cookie ever) and some refreshing ice tea. This is a charming little boutique bed and breakfast.  I highly recommend staying here.I love boutique hotels!  For the most part we had a great time staying here. I so wish I could give this place a 5.  Highlights:-  Great location. Away from the heart of downtown, but everything is in a very short driving distance- Property is well taken care of, up to date on decor- Rooms are a GREAT size and wonderful amenities! - TASTY breakfast!  Baked Cookies! - Condo style environment with a lot of the rooms =  quiet. Cons:- We chose the one room with the jacuzzi outside on the enclosed patio.  Before any love birds think this is a wonderful idea, be aware that the room you are in shares a wall with the kitchen.  The prep counter they use is backed up to your wall.  The kitchen staff comes in 5:00- 6:00 am to start to prep your tasty breakfast. The walls are thin and the noise echos cause the bfast hall is all tile flooring.  They were playing light music while they work, talking on the phone, laughing with each other (How dare they enjoy their jobs!? lol)... But honestly you HEAR it all.  If you like to sleep in until dawn, this room is NOT for you!)  This is the only room attached to the ""main house"" and the noise will go away after bfast hours.  We had a friendly chat to make them  aware but honestly what can you do to eliminate this 100%?  Ask them to stop making you a rockin bfast?  :) -  They were going through management changes when I visited.  My experience leading up to arrival was great, as the manager was a wonderful Sedona Concierge. We did not receive the same level of service once we got there.  In all fairness, they may have worked that out by now!My new husband and I loved it here. The room was stunning and even though we checked in after the office closed, we had ice in the freezer and cookies! The fireplace was stunning and the hottub was very relaxing... The only thing we would have changed is that we booked more than one night!This place was amazing!  The room was huge and had its own fireplace and balcony! The location was ideal as it was the first round about we hit (traveling from the south) and it was not too far from shops and restaurants.  Upon checking in they asked if we had any dietary restrictions for breakfast the next morning. We actually showed up early for breakfast but the girl was super accommodating. We had some fruit and yogurt. Again, our choice because we were early as we had to hit the road.This place was wonderful. We wish we had more time to spend here!We just returned from spending the weekend at Las Posadas.  It was very enjoyable and quiet.  The morning breakfast (included) was very tasty.  The staff were all friendly.  The units were really spacious.  We chose this inn as they do allow dogs ($25 fee).  It is not right in Sedona but rather, in The Village of Oak Creek which is just outside Sedona.  I like that it was a little out of town because it was so quiet.  I would totally return.  Oh, we had dinner across the road at Cucina Rustica.  Fantastic!I have never been to a bed and breakfast and this place made me fall in love with what we got. The location is 7 miles from the city center-not that big of a deal. It is located in a quiet peaceful area (although I think all of Sedona is like that). No problem with parking, we parked near our room. We went at the end of December-really cold but perfectly fine when hiking.About the room-very spacious, spotless, beautiful fireplace, loved the jacuzzi.We went on a weekday getting a discount. Jeff was amazing-first by phone he gave me advice and was even so nice as to type out a one page description of how to get to a certain hiking area by way of how the locals do it. I thought that was so nice! I found ALL staff to be friendly, accommodating, and more.  We did not always show up before the time they left (around 5) but they left the key on the front window. The breakfast was good and we enjoyed that. However I did not like the afternoon snacks, none of us ate them for the 2 nights we were there. That's ok, good thing we brought our own snacks.  If you ever go to Sedona, I highly recommend Las Posadas!We've had an amazing stay here! Was a little concerned about the cost at first but it's certainly worth it! Plenty of room, relaxing setting and a great location as it's a little away from the town of Sedona.  Would visit again!I love Las Posadas! We always stay there when we go to Sedona, and they never disappoint. The idea of a bed and breakfast turned me off at first, but this place was built to be a bed and breakfast. You don't feel like you are in a random person's house- it's private, cozy and comfortable. I love the fireplaces in each room, and breakfast has always been good. The staff is kind and accomodating, and you are in walking distance of some great dining options. One reccomendation, if you can reserve the room with the hot tub, it is absolutely PERFECT in the AZ winter nights.Las Posadas provided our hotel accommodations while in Sedona over this past weekend.  It was our first time staying there, and we are so glad we did!  Dorrie, the Office Manage ( I believe ), the Breakfast Chef ( included daily ) and Zenaida, the Cleaning Lady, were fabulous.  We stayed in a view room and enjoyed our Red Rock views and patio immensely.  The rooms are unique in that the feel is more like renting your very own private condominium studio - Not hotel-style at all!  We loved the open space feel of the entire unit and having the mini kitchenette is an absolute bonus.  Clean (not perfect) but very comfortable AND at an awesome value.  Looking forward to returning, especially once the pool is completed!  Thanks for a wonderful stay Las Posadas - See you again soon!Normally we like to stay at larger resorts but this time my wife suggested we try a smaller more intimate property.  She found Las Posadas and we fell in love with it immediately!  We have room to park our motorcycle trailer with a Jacuzzi outside the front door and a fireplace at the foot of the bed.  Our visit was wonderful and we will be back.Las Posadas is not a typical bed and breakfast. It is a cluster of small apartment-like dwellings.  Our room had a living room with a couch, TV, and small fridge and microwave. The bedroom was separate with a king size bed and spacious bathroom. The place is clean, modern, and new.  The location is great - technically not in Sedona but the adjacent town of Oak Creek Village about 7 miles from the central touristy area of Sedona. I prefer this location to central Sedona--plenty of shops and restaurants and access to main attractions.The breakfast was excellent. We were asked about dietary restrictions before our arrival and we told them we don't eat pork. However, both breakfast entres had pork our first morning. The chef, Austin, made us an excellent, improvised breakfast burrito which saved the meal for us. But the poor communication is why we gave it 4 stars and not 5.Las posadas was a great little suite to take in after a long night at a wedding.  Very nice, clean and quiet. We will definitely be coming back again!!!Great stay.  I am a fan of smaller, boutique places because they tend to weed out the riff-raff and you don't tend to get screaming kids.  Or my other favorite--the people who hog the deck chairs at the pool at 7am.  This place is completely tucked away, relaxed, and well appointed.  There are only 20 units but the grounds are pretty expansive.  Our Valencia room was at least 1000 square feet.  And we had our own little kitchen, living room, and outside patio.  Charming little place.  Only an 8 to 10 minute drive to Sedona.We, and many of our guests, stayed at Las Posadas in August for our wedding. It is a beautiful property with gorgeous villas and rooms, well decorated, spacious, etc. I rented a villa so that my bridesmaids and I would have lots of room to get ready, and it was perfect! It may have actually been about as big as my house, but much more luxurious. Dory is amazing and so are the rest of the staff. Breakfast was yummy the morning I was able to have it (missed it the first morning due to having to get up and go get our hair done). We are hoping to return for our anniversary!We went here for our anniversary last month.  It was wonderful! The staff is super friendly, and they knew it was our anniversary so they brought homemade truffles to our room.  We had the suite with the hot tub outside, and it was nice.  The hot breakfast in the morning was delicious.  The room was clean...we will be here again next year.We had a change of plans and I cancelled our reservation one month in advance and they charged us $75 to cancel.  You must read the fine print in their cancellation policy -it is not written as clear as it could be....  It states ""Cancellations must be made 15 or more days prior to arrival date to receive a full refund""  It should not use the word ""full refund"" because there is no full refund.  Once you reserve here be sure not to cancel as you are charged a minimum of $75.   I read it quickly -my mistake but there is so much fine print to read and I have never had a hotel not give me a full refund for giving them one months notice. We hoped to stay at this hotel in the future but with this cancellation policy I'm not sure we would.  We have 2 little kids and traveling can be so unpredictable with children so we need hotels with better flexibility. I suggest to management to place on their website the following as I'm sure many others have fallen trap to this.  ""If you cancel at any time you will be charged a minimum of $75 per room and there is no refund for cancellations within 15 days of your arrival.""Slam. Dunk.  Terrific accommodations, beautifully maintained, comfy bed, gas fireplaces, red rock views, and a delicious breakfast.If you're deciding between here and someplace cheaper for a romantic getaway, go here.  It's worth every penny.","The best bed and breakfast I've ever been to. Very spacious and quiet. The fireplace was very helpful because it did get a little chilly outside. My favorite part was the bathrooms, loved the hot tub and the glass showers! Sedona is a magnificent place! Planning a trip back next year as well. Will be staying here againclean, friendly and a good value in the Sedona area.Worth the money! This place was quiet and very nice. My husband and I came for our first anniversary and loved it. We got the room with a full size hot tub and it was beautiful. We had a great time and will be back.This place is wonderful!  It's a B&amp;B but not your typical inn. The rooms are big suites and the breakfast is gourmet!We timed it right (the first week in March) which is before high season. We got a lower rate, missed the crowds and the heat. Perfect for us.The location is more to the Village of Oak Creek end of Sedona so if you are driving up from Phoenix it's right off the first round about.Highly recommended!",,,,"['las', 'times',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/arabella-hotel-sedona-sedona,Arabella Hotel Sedona,3.0,$$,30,"We got a special wedding party rate at this hotel, and in spite of my FRANTIC ""shopping around"" on and offline, I couldn't find anything better that was close to the wedding venue (L'Auberge/$$$$$$$$$$)  Sedona is what it is, esp. during its busy season, and even the ""cheap"" places to stay might take a bite out of your budget.  With a week's vacation and TONS of stuff planned, we didn't want to spend too much on what we needed, which were clean, comfortable, basic accommodations, preferably with a pool and breakfast.  We got all that and MUCH more here at the Arabella.  Fast, friendly check in, perfect balcony room overlooking the courtyard (I would insist on balcony over ground level, unless stairs are a problem for you) and an AWESOME view of the red rocks which was second to none!!  We arrived on a Friday evening, checked in, and really didn't spend too much time at the hotel, as we were meeting up with family, but did take advantage of the main courtyard pool (COLD in the morning!!) and perfectly acceptable breakfast.  Our two night stay in our double queen room (wanted King, but it wasn't available) was comfortable and problem free.  We didn't check out the spa or the VERY recommended Elote Cafe, but our time was limited.  I would definitely recommend a stay here, as it's perfectly located, convenient, and quite comfortable...  We moved on to another location after the wedding, just a little farther outside of town, only because we're EXTREME cheapos, but this was a FINE home base for us for our first few days in Sedona!!This place is fine.  Not at all overpriced or dirty overall.  Although we do have a tiny bandaid on the wall.   Himmmm.  No bother.Not sure about other horrid reviews.  We drive here from Phx.  We've actually been here before.  Last year?  I am pretty sure we have same room.  250.  The check in gal was slightly in edge.  But accommodating.It's quiet here now- end of August. Elote is closed for vacation until September 2nd.  When it's open it is much more ""festive"".  I appreciate the many different types of people we meet here -from France, Germany, Mexico.  It's  awesome!  This hotel had to have been built in the 1960s.  I think some rooms but not all rooms have been remodeled. We are in a remodeled one.  Perhaps the older ones are what all the smelly reviews are about.  The decor in the room is new retro 60s style.  Cool.  We do not appreciate the jet bathtub.  It just doesn't seem clean.  I can't imagine they deep clean it so - not necessary.I don't really appreciate the soaps &amp; shampoos in the refillable wall containers.  But it works.  The little fridge is good.  The beds are a bit firm.  Clean white cotton linen and shiny satin bedspread.  Pillows are extra great.  Balcony with little table and 2 chairs is nice.It has an old fashioned Mad Men feel to it.  That is why I like it, I guess.  I love how th main pool is the center of all of the original rooms.  Makes me feel as if I am back in the day gazing at the same sky and beautiful mountains the 60s folks did.  It is actually neat!  Breakfast is acceptable.  Cereals, cold milk (almond milk too).  Fresh bananas and apples.  Hard boiled eggs. Quality whole wheat bread.  Bagels - just the cruddy plain kind.  Butter packets, cream cheese cups.  Jams and syrups.  Make your own waffle griddle.  Sausage patty was pretty dang salty.  Scrambled eggs are just the reconstituted kind and they taste like what they are.  The lady watching over everything was kind and helpful.We really enjoy the pool.  We wished the big pool was heated.  It is just nippy.  Hot tub is great.  Everything is clean.  Staff is always on the go cleaning and maintaining everything.  The pool guy and towel lady made sure the pool area was ready for guests.All in all, it is worth $150.We will come again.Stayed here two nights for Fourth of July weekend.It's conveniently located on AZ-179 on the way to Uptown Sedona. The rooms seem to have been renovated. They have three or four buildings where rooms have balconies. But I was stuck in a room on the ground floor in the main building. The reception is literally right around the corner. But it's just a room to sleep in as I'm doing lots of hiking up all the amazing red rock formation.The book is booked through ""Rocketmiles"" which would award me 1,500 Asia Miles (as does with many airlines) and the rate is $119 before tax. The room (Room 1125) itself is more than adequate. Plenty of lighting. two huge lamps on the nightstand, another one on the writing desk with pull-out working table. 42"" TV. The bathroom is hilarious. It's got a wheeler accessible shower space with a commote like you see at the hospital. The water in the shower is not hot enough and water pressure needs improvement. The A/C is running well. The complimentary breakfast is nothing to call home about. Hordes of people are hogging the toaster with four slots and the single waffle machine. The sausage patties are way too salty that I feel I have enough sodium for the whole week. The scrambled egg has a texture of mashed potato and does not taste like egg. All I had for breakfast was a muffin and a cup of coffee from the lobby. The coffee a the breakfast room is too watery. To make the long story short: skip the breakfast and go somewhere else to eat.Wifi is free but not the strongest. Complimentary bike for sightseeing. Walking distance to an OK convenience store (practically next door).Overall it's not a bad place to stay. It's adequate for sleeping. It's clean. Staff is super friendly and accommodating.BEAUTIFUL rooms!!! First off, we cant seriously find out how to turn the lights on...seriously. No knobs, no light switch. Nothing!!!! Called the front desk, he said he would come down and find the switch on the lamps....ahhhhhh...they are on the CORDS!!!Weird!!!The room is nice, roomy and cozy........great place for luggage. Huge windows to enjoy the view...Very happy with the room. Quiet. Nice.Looking outside our patio there is a fire pit going. Soooo nice.See photos I posted up above....awesome place!!Would recommend!!!!!Will be back to stay here again.Great location with average accommodations. Continental breakfast is subpar but better than nothing. Front desk is very nice and helpful. Rooms are outdated and nothing great.I love this hotel. When I arrived they upgraded me to a deluxe room at the trailhead of the mountain. My large balcony had an amazing view of the red rocks. The pool and spa are great. The continental breakfast actually had hot food. Free mountain bikes to borrow. My room was huge with a nice sized desk to work at. Spa top in my room felt great after a hike and having the amazing Elote Cafe connected just made it all the better. Room was super clean, bed was super comfy and I cannot wait to come back. You get a lot of bang for your buck so to speak.We checked into the Arabella last night randomly and we are very pleased! The room is very clean and the beds were super comfortable! Thank you Jason for being so accommodating! And thank you to the entire staff! We will definitely be back.Great hotel of you are traveling with dogs. They had a small dog area to walk them (although grass and more lighting would have been nice). But everyone was very friendly and helpful. Room was very clean and quiet. Towels weren't super soft but bed was pretty comfortable. Room seemed updated and cable was really Nice. The temperature seemed really hard to control in the room. You have to choose heat or air but if you leave the heat on you wake up during the night burning hot. Doesn't seem to stay at the right temperature. We didn't get much sleep because of that. Only other thing we didn't like was they called a cab for us and some greasy guy in an unmarked car showed up and randomly charged us $10 for a 2 minute car ride (no meter so he just made up a price). I would definitely stay here again when the weather is nicer so we don't need to worry about the heater.*Hot rooms *Rude staff*Filthy Room*Dirty room*Filthy bathtubWe took a trip to Sedona for the Celebration of Spring egg hunt event. Check in wasn't until 4 pm, but we figured that maybe by chance the room might be ready as the checkout times for the hotel is 11 a.m.We pulled into the hotel premises at around 2:45 pm hopeful that we might be able to check in. I walked up to the front desk, at this time the lobby was clear and asked the tight lipped front desk woman if our room was ready. She looked up my information and said flatly  ""No, check in is at 4 o clock"" Okay, I thought to myself, I ""tried""... Our children both under the age of four were very tired and cranky at this point, so rather than try to kill some more time sightseeing, we just drove around the corner to the Circle K next door to pick up some water. Traffic was extremely congested this day, so we decided to pull back into the hotel parking lot and ended up driving around what seems to be either  a rundown seedy motel or apartment complex directly next to the Arabella Hotel. What was striking about this motel is that it is almost exactly the same color as the Arabella. What was also striking were two oily, dirty women sharing what looked to be a glass pipe from the balcony walkway above. From there we drove to the other side the Arabella, we decided to just park with the A/C running and just wait it out. While parked we noticed a couple of the hotel maids stumble out of one the rooms, and when I say ""stumble out"" that's exactly what I'm saying, they looked like they'd fallen asleep in a field of poppies ala Wizard of Oz. At 4 p.m. I walked back into the hotel, this time there was a long line of guests that would be checking also. A few of them were told that there rooms were not ready, that it might be until 6 p.m. before there room was available. One of the front desk clerks suggested to one of these guests that they should try waiting in front of the Elote Cafe, he told her that this was ""THE BEST Mexican restaurant in all of the state,"" and ""that past 5 p.m. the lines form very quickly that you can't get a table"". He then told her ""go wait in line in front of the cafe over there, and hey if your room becomes available, I'll wave at you."" But that was all a ruse, as the Elote Cafe doesn't open until 5 p.m. and it was only 4:07 p.m. Ten minutes later I saw this lady sadly walk back to her parked car. When we finally made it to our room, our first impression was HOW HOT the temperature in the room was... the a/c was completely shut off. When the Arabella says a ""room with a view"" they mean a room facing direct sunshine with an overview of other people lounging in the pool, oh and the highway and then maybe the hill behind all that mess. W got the a/c going and I decided to take a shower, it was an uncomfortable shower after I discovered hair lodged in certain areas. The curtain and tub was filthy.The minifridge had smudges all over it, and on the inside were two tall cans of beer, that were near full. The carpet had random wet spots in it.  The whole room was just disgusting, hot, stuffy and beyond uncomfortable. To add to all this the walls were painted a depressing yellow, like a giant tobacco stain. We decided to cut our losses ($214.00) and after 2 hours we packed up and drove back to our home in  Phoenix for a good night's sleep.*Hot rooms *Rude staff*Filthy Room*Dirty room*Filthy bathtubI flip flopped on 3 or 4 stars but affordability and amenities won me over. I made reservations by phone about a month before our stay (our 5 year wedding anniversary), we were bringing our dog so we wanted to be sure it was truly pet friendly. The woman I spoke to was helpful. I wanted a King bed but she stated the only dog friendly room left was Queen. I took it knowing I could cancel my reservation 2 days before my reserved date. I recieved a confirmation email. A few hours later she sent me another email stating they could get us in a King room and they'd give it to us at the Queen price!We checked in right at check in time (4:00). There was a line but it went quickly. My check in went smoothly. There was free tea and water in the lobby. We found parking right outside our room. We stayed in Room 126. The room was nice. It was mostly clean, we noticed some trail mix pieces under the desk. Otherwise no complaints. The door to the room looked like it was pried into at some point. Mini fridge. Great view. Patio with table and chairs. One weird thing was we got complimentary shampoo and lotion but no soap. (They gave us some when they cleaned the room the next day but forgot to refill the tissue dispenser). We kept meaning to stop back at the lobby and ask for some but kept forgetting so we ended up buying some. The bed was comfortable,  toilet and shower worked! Yay!Luckily I brought ear plugs. Late at night and early morning there is alot of noise. You can hear people upstairs running around. Little kids yelling outside. And they make us sign a noise policy if our dog barks! My dog was far better behaved than these kids. Trash (chip bags, French fry containers) was left in the grass of the courtyard but they don't want our dog going out there.  Makes me laugh. They have a small dirt area by our room for dogs to do their thing with a free poop bag dispenser. On to the free breakfast served 7-10am served in the back of Elote restaurant. Bagels, scrambled and hardboiled eggs, danish, cereal, apples, sausage, oatmeal, make your own waffle station. Juice bar, coffee, etc. The waffles were great. It took me forever to hunt down butter though. I asked one worker and she pointed to the drink dispenser?? I found out someone spilled milk in the butter so they were getting more. Lori, the woman I assume was running breakfast was frantic the whole time. Yelling loudly at workers. Moving/carrying around chairs and tables. She couldn't find the toaster. I want a relaxing quiet breakfast,  not some OCD hovering over my table ready to pounce on my plates to clean up. We didn't go back the second morning. There is a really awesome trail behind the hotel called Marg's Draw. Great views from up there. We hit that trail right after check in. Great place to watch the sunset. We skipped eating at Elote because they are not pet friendly. And the hostess seemed rude. Sorry for bothering you.Beware that parking gets tight between 4pm and 10p while the restaurant is running. They need to designate parking spots for guests only.The pool and spa were open. Free ice. Soda machines. Circle K a short walk away if you need something. I would definitely stay here again even with all the little things that bugged me. It was a great price for a decent place. It's a short drive to town. Very convenient.Enjoyed our stay here, the breakfast was great, swimming pool was awesome, we slept very well here. Can't wait to return next summer!!Loved this hotel. Would stay again in a heart beat. Clean nice rooms. Very friendly staff. Good breakfast buffet with a great view of the red rocks. We walk from our hotel to the restaurants and shops.This place had a weird and old smell to it. The staff was friendly enough. But I was suppose to get a balcony room as discussed with the girl on the phone, but didn't. They gave me the smallest and cheapest room AND I got charged for a balcony room. They did reimburse me, after making a bunch of calls. Check in was at 4pm. Not a minute earlier, unless you had a nicer room. It sucked waiting there and everyone else that had the balcony/courtyard rooms getting early check in, when we were just told no one gets an early check in. The breakfast was disgusting. I will never go back.Julia Kaiser. Asst. General Manager, made our stay here wonderful.  Julia took the time to personalize our stay and really made it special.  I look forward to staying here again in the future. Sedona is a one of a kind place to visit. Editing my review as the new room we stayed in did not have towels. Not sure how this can be missed but it was an important one.   Need to do better next time.I found this place on Expedia and it was such a disappointment!! First time I have not been happy! We thought we were getting a room with a little patio and they put us in the old hotel above the little pool no access to outside unless u walk down a stairwell the smelled like cigarette smoke masked with bad air freshener. My 4 year old grabbed the railing in the stairwell to walk down the stairs and it fell off the wall, the room was super hot like the air turned off in the middle of the night . I had an extra night booked and we cancelled it and almost went home , thank god we found a different place!!The customer service here is by far the worst I have ever experienced in a very long time. I did not stay here but I didn't need to, because I knew exactly how I would be treated if I did. I booked online and arrived at 11am by the off chance a room would be available early, this is not uncommon practice but immediately I was brushed off by a ""check in is at 4pm."" Ok fine, maybe since it's a small town they don't have the staff to handle check in's and check out's quickly. She asked us to come back at 1-2pm, and maybe something would be ready. Ok, we'll check again at 2pm. At 2pm, we got the response, ""No, it won't be ready until 4pm."" Sigh, but fine, we'll check in then. Then 4:15pm came around and still no room. Not even a sorry, or we'll make it up to you. Not a modicum of customer service just a blank and monotone response from the front desk that it wasn't ready and there was not a time in sight of when it would be.  The big problem with this is not just the above, but I had booked to stay for a wedding. The wedding started at 5pm. At 4:38p I called back and calmly asked again if the room was ready, no it wasn't, again not a sorry in sight. And that was the straw that broke this little camel's back as I asked them how they would make this right, their only response was a 20% discount, which in my opinion not good enough, for making us late to a wedding and without the ability to have a room to get ready in. Without a seconds thought I immediately cancelled the reservation, and told them I shouldn't be penalized for it with their late cancellation fee's because what we had endured up until that point was pretty ridiculous. Their response you ask? Ok, we'll cancel. This is exactly how companies act when they believe they don't depend upon the money's incoming from guests or they have so much business because of their location, they don't need to cater to a customer. So friends, I can't stress this enough...Even if the price/location seems attractive, do not book. Even if it's the only hotel room in town, use Airbnb instead, you're money will be better spent and you'll meet much nicer and accommodating people.First off we got the room for $50, 5 nights from a time share in Maui, so we didn't expect amazing but did expect better!! First day killed a black widow. Second day 2 roaches. Third day a huge brown super almost landed in my lap and there are lizards every where, I can deal with lizards, not bugs!!! Staff didn't care! The bed was mushy! The bathroom needs new seal... We left a $5 tip each day yet little things like sink not washed out was irritating. Would not stay here again!Originally this hotel looked decent and a good deal for the price, but during the night my wife had allergic reaction to something in the bed. Had trouble breathing. She went out side and started feeling fine. went back inside to go to sleep at about 2 in the morning and woke up at 5:30 with her lungs really hurting. The hotel switched rooms for the 2nd night but could not really enjoy the day with out any sleep. We met friends there so the day without sleeping the night before affected all 4 of our retreat for the weekend. The other room was much improved and appreciated, however the day after that night was to do a short hike and travel back home, so our whole weekend was impacted from this. The manager took off half of the first night, which I thought when she said half off that she meant the whole bill. To top things off the breakfast was lousy, eggs were watery and not much available. There is a reason this hotel seems cheap! it is!!! Worst experience with a hotel ever.  To add final insult to injury; Since my wife originally booked the trip with her card it was charged the morning of the planned stay, My card was charged for the bill when we got there and it was charged a 2nd time to reflect the reduction  in cost on the new bill. So we have three charges on our accounts showing pending, so over $700 in charges until the bank clears the correct bill, which is now about $200 for the two nights after $65 reduction.  We assume the allergic reaction was due to a cat in the room but not sure, could be some cheap cleaner that they used. Anyway any decent person would have just voided the entire bill. The manager made it seem like a burden that she had to deduct some money from our bill. This is my first review this negative and believe me it takes a lot to get me to talk this badly about a business, but they need to take better care of their customers. I was close to taking my wife to the hospital that night, but the Benadryl curbed it enough to get through the night. Serious health risk for us to stay here again.. And the beds were hard, pillows soft which also made sleeping uncomfortable. no one in our group got a good nights sleep..After writing review, I was contacted by the manager. I had assumed the person who helped me was the manager. The manager apologized for his staff and credited me for the bill. After experience with the manager (Chris), it is only fair to give him credit for making things right.We had a great stay. The rooms are good and clean. Beds are comfortable. Staff is very helpful and friendly. They provided information, maps, etc. and were very approachable. Breakfast and cafeteria can be improved in terms of the food served, cleanliness and space during peak times. We did the hike that starts right behind the hotel and it was beautiful. Views are gorgeous. Overall a comfortable stay.Great location,close to all the shops as well as the best Mexican restaurant I've been to. The room was a good size for a family of 4.we arrived early for check in and a room was not ready for us but they upgraded us to right across from the garden and pool,it was great! The breakfast was delicious with lots of hot food options. I would Definetly recommend this hotel.","My boyfriend and I stayed here for the weekend. Love the place, however I accidentally left my work cell phone in Rm 120 but no one turned it in. I am definitely going back to Sedona but this time we might choose a different location.Oh man!!  Had to get the place on expedia because Hiltons all sold out.  First mistake..We get here and the front desk old guy is bad mouthing expedia to some other customers.  Ok, whatever.  We get in the rooms and the curtains are torn up, yes, ripped and torn the the carpet is old and smelly plus the kicker?  The rooms stinks of cigarette smoke!  We both smelled it and it was bad.  We tell the front desk old guy and he is surprised that we are surprised like this the norm.  He says in a pre practiced way ""I'll make a note of it"" if that didn't insult me I don't know what would?  He could care less of our complaints!  This dump reminds me of a dumpy old hotel room from the 70's outside of las Vegas or Disneyland!  The girl at the front desk was very nice but the old guy just didn't care and it showed.  Time to retire!  Please see my picture of the expensive room with torn curtains..  This is a first, Im a pilot and spend a lot of time in hotels and I have to say that this is a first.  Congrats!  DUMP!  The rooms were not all that clean either, sink area, tub, bathroom etc..All just not what I expected!I really don't know what to say about all these bad reviews, we stayed last weekend and our room was big, clean and quiet. The grounds were fine and the staff was more than helpful in accommodating us considering either I or expedia screwed our dates up. The beds were really comfortable and the pillows I wanted to steal they were so good. Our room was very cool temp wise and didn't have any kind of cigarette smell like others have complained of, maybe we just got a good room and lucked out. The restaurant Elote was amazing!! But be ready for at least an hour wait if not two.Staff seemed a little preoccupied always, the room was extremely noisy (you could hear the people walking above pretty badly), it was a dog friendly hotel which we needed (but their idea of the dog area was a bleak red dirt lot with lots of weeds and sticker burrs, not great for furry friends). The hotel room was dog friendly in that the floor was tile. The bed was soft and pillows were decent. There was a continental breakfast complete with waffle maker which came in handy for a quick breakfast in the morning before going out for adventures. There was a courtyard with pool and lots of lounge chairs which we did not use because it was ""no dogs allowed."" Let's just say they allow pets to stay here but it's not ""dog friendly.""Let me start by saying I was not able to stay here due to the horrible front desk and reservation service. As this is a pet friendly hotel, I of course wanted to confirm as I have a large dog. The first time I called I sat on hold for 25 minutes until I finally hung up. I tried again the next day and got right through, but when I said I wanted to make a reservation, I was greeted with ""Ummm....I can't help you with that right now because I have a lobby full of people"".  After Being caught off guard I then asked if they could call me back so I could book, which he agreed to in an annoyed manner. To this day I have not received a call back.While I did read some negative reviews as to their level of service, I was still willing to give it a shot due to the price, however, I am thinking that if they are incapable of taking a reservation or returning a phone call then I am glad I didn't have the chance to waste my money.Great remodeled rooms. Awesome staff. Beautiful room views!!! For the price this was the best. El Lote Caffe it's across from the room. Excellent food within walking distanceOur room was comped for 4 days, which is why we stayed there.  Mixed reviews from us.  We were really scared to stay here after reading all the yelp reviews (although to be fair, this hotel gets better reviews on other websites).  In short, the property is not sketchy or horrible.  The courtyard is really quite nice, which several areas with tables and chairs, a firepit, flowers.  The rooms are okay...our had some weird plaster stuff going on on the walls, but it was clean (minus the dead bugs in the bathroom light).  Unlike many reviewers, I did not find our bed to be comfortable.  The actual bedding was cheap feeling and there was a plastic-rubbery cover under the sheets, I guess to protect the mattress?  It was noisy and uncomfortable.  Our room never got really chilly, although we had the AC running almost always, but it was fine.  The AC unit wasn't noisy, as other people have claimed.  We had no trouble with the front desk staff, except for a mix-up on the last day where we had housekeeping knocking on our door and the front desk calling, all to find out when we were leaving after they had already approved a late check out.  Housekeeping missed our room the first day, they just didn't come, and I'm not sure they would have come subsequent days if I hadn't reminded them or the front desk.  Really basic service from them.  The fridge in the room didn't work, it kept getting warmer then colder, eventually ruining all the food we took and leaking all over the floor.  The hotel was really good about us bringing our dogs and the hotel's pet area is adequate.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it's a dirt area with some rocks and benches.  It's not a grassy dog park and it doesn't purport to be, it was fine.  My husband went to breakfast the first day, it was basic non-brand-name, lower quality foods.  We did not return.  I flat out refused to swim in the pool the first day, when the pump wasn't running and there was debris all over the pool, plus tissues at the bottom (gross).  Also, the tiles on the sides of the pool are black with dirt, suntan lotion, dust, etc...I talked to one of the staff about it the following morning and he seemed surprised about the state of the pool the prior evening and said regarding the tiles, ""Yeah, I need to get to that.""  By the time we returned several hours later, the water looked cleaned up but the tiles were still totally gross.  In short, this stay would have cost $700 for the 4 days we were there (inclusive of the pet fee of $25/night).  Had this room not been comped, we would have been really upset with the quality.   I feel like a hotel charging $150 should have a pretty decent breakfast (if they're going to offer it), consistent housekeeping services, clean facilities everywhere, high thread count bedding.  Our stay was more like a hotel that charges $75-95/night.  It was like a La Quinta that had been refurbished a few years ago and was now showing the wear, not completely horrible but not great either.This review is for the customer service only.  When we arrived, we were told they did not have rooms for us due to plumbing problems in the room. It was a terrible situation and of course, we were not happy. The Assistant GM, Julia, took fantastic care of us and set up accommodations at another hotel. I was impressed with her genuine care and concern to make sure we still enjoyed our visit to Sedona even though we were disappointed that we couldn't stay at the Arabella. Outstanding service!They let us big both my dogs for a $50 pet fee...$25 each pet. They also have a small dog park, which isn't fenced but it's nice to have a spot to walk your dog. We had a room with a view and it was beautiful! It was really nice having breakfast in the morning. Staff was friendly. You have to share you balcony with your neighbor, which makes your room seem a little less private.I checked in my wife and kids at around 3:30 and Ken the front desk guy was the biggest prick I have ever met. Those of you that know me know that I'm a pretty cool guy and normally dont let shit bother me. Well he treated me like shit twice. Im so pissed that I'm already hecking out at its 7:30pm. I will never ever stay here or recommend anyone to stay here.",,,,"['special', 'wedding', 'party', 'rate', 'hotel', 'spite', 'frantic', 'shopping', 'around', 'find', 'anything', 'better', 'close',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-portal-sedona-hotel-sedona-5,El Portal Sedona Hotel,4.5,$$$,41,"What a quaint, cozy place and after all the years, I have visited one of my favorite places on earth....I find this jewel. I will be back again and again and again. Ahhhh....just saw Jackie, the owner's wife with their two of three Bassett Hounds - Ollie &amp; Dexter!!  Can't say enough good things about this wonderful hideaway!  I look forward to many more retreats to this peaceful place. Oh!  And don't forget the breakfast!  Delish...Arizona style!!This place rules. Yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, some little touch ups could be done in rooms to make them seem a little newer (cracks in the walls and such). However, those very minor things were nothing in comparison to how incredible everything else at El Portal was. Being from the Old Pueblo (that's Tucson, for you newbies to the AZ), I grow tired of hokey faux-Southwest decor, so I was pleased to see nothing hokey about this hotel. El Portal more closely resembles a B&amp;B than a hotel, as they serve breakfast in the morning from 8-10 and offer complimentary snacks in the late afternoon/early evening. They also keep their little kitchen stocked with coffee (if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a...WAIT...I mean, if you can push a button, you can stand to make your own K-Cup coffee), soda, hot water, wine, and hot chocolate. The property itself is beautiful with the interior main house having very sturdy wooden fixtures, and the main courtyard filled with tables and chairs to relax, as well as a large fire pit. We stayed in the Arts and Crafts room (#4), and loved the fact that our room had its own courtyard that our German Shepherd, Rose, could enjoy. They also gave us a little dog basket filled with dog treats made at a local pet bakery, dog bags (you know for the business side of things), a couple dog blankets, and a towel. Our room also had both a standalone shower and a whirlpool tub, which was a bit difficult for my bf to figure out, so some help on that front would have been cool upon check in. There was also a fireplace in our room, which we totally would have used if it had been cooler outside during our stay. There was a small fridge in our room as well, which was wonderful for us to store a few snacks in. The sheer amount of space and privacy in the room was fantastic and holy smokes I loved the bed. It was soo comfortable, and huge. Teri was awesome, as was owner Steve. Both were knowledgeable about the area and loved our dog, Rose. We did have breakfast in the morning, and my bf loved his omelet. I had the pancakes and I was stuffed after just one of them. Overall, awesome stay, friendly people, and beautiful property. :)Loved this pet-friendly place, and like Steve the owner, said on his website, you'll leave saying, ""I wish I had more time to spend here!"" We stayed for a weekend with not one, but two large doggies, and the rooms are spacious, immaculate, and luxurious in a low-key way. I loved the peace and quiet. If you like expensive modern style hotels via loud Las Vegas party rooms this place is NOT for you. But if you like Southwest decor, Navajo, Dine design-inspired robes in the guest closet, California arts and crafts furniture, the place is charming. Friendly and accommodating staff who aren't in your face all the time, the El Portal was perfect. Animal lovers rejoice! Yes, you have to go to the Great Room to get coffee, snacks etc. but why would you want to stay inside when there's beauty all around you? The courtyard is serene, with a fire pit at night, but with only a weekend to spare, we were so happy to step out of our little patio area and see all the stars in the cloudless night sky. So great to get away from NYC! Loved the bath toiletries, a luxurious soak in the tub after a hike. Can't wait to come back!What a fantastic place hidden away I didn't even know this place was here . It's a perfect destination spot located steps away from the action but yet peaceful . The fire pit was a special feature I loved sitting out there . We had the green room it was fantastic gorgeous and had a robe I would love to have and a blanket I want too ! The rooms get pitch black and makes for a good sleep. The beds are cozy the pillows were nice but a little low for me . I did hear a sound like someone was walking around the room on the wood floor. It was interesting . Thanks for the trip we will be back again really soon !My husband and I found this hotel and made it out vacation destination. We drove all the way from SF Bay Area and it was worth it! This hotel was nothing short of amazing. Plus our two Boston pups had a great time as well.There are already several great reviews for this place so I won't bore you by repeating the accurate comments but I do want to add my 2 cents to their rating.I had the pleasure of chatting with Steve, the owner, about the impetus for this place.  It was our first getaway with our dog in tow and it was the pet friendly experience that attracted my interest.  I love Peter K.'s comment that this ""is a Resort for Dogs that allows humans.""  They really do have a great little hide-away for folks traveling with their dog who want to feel welcome (dogs and humans).We only stayed for a couple of days but plan to ""pop in"" more often now that we know about this place.  The only bad thing about rating them so high is that others are going to find out about this awesome gem!At first I was in love with the hotel. It's beautiful with such a cozy cottage like vibe. Very homey and welcoming &amp; the breakfast is wonderful. &amp; as I continued my visit I found that not only were the neighbors staying in the rooms next to me shockingly rude, but as was the staff. They hounded my grandmother about the payment for the hotel, which was at first completely understandable, as you HAVE to pay for what you've received, &amp; we definitely intend to and will. But they have not only made shockingly rude comments about how they ""want us out"" &amp; have left notes on our door &amp; are even starting to harass me &amp; my sister, it's starting to get ridiculous. They threatened the police. We are or trying to rob them of anything &amp; will not go without paying. This homey environment quickly turned very hostile &amp; I am now very uncomfortable with my stay here.Hidden gem of small hotel with the feel of a bed and breakfast. Located in lower Sedona and sweetly  secreted behind Los Abrigados Resort and Tlaquepaque Arts &amp; Crafts Village,  this stuccoed villa boasts an arts and crafts dining room with large timber rafters, unique iron fixtures and hardware and spacious,  well appointed rooms. Our room boasted views of sunrise and sunset views off nearby red bluffs and cheerful bird songs each morning from the enclosed, vine sheltered courtyard below us.  Breakfast was authentic Mexican/Southwest and freshly made - best huevos rancheros I've ever had! Steve the owner/creator was eager to share stories on how they envisioned and built the hotel, or quick to sketch out a map to interesting sites,  shops or drives nearby. We will come back!What an incredible place! Every suite is beautiful (we stayed in three) and our dog was thrilled to receive her own basket of blankets, baggies and treats.This trip to Sedona was a long-awaited and greatly anticipated getaway for my husband and me. We quickly discovered that staying at El Portal is like visiting relatives who really like you. We were introduced to -- and warmly greeted by -- staff members on arrival. It was made clear that we would be provided with anything that would make our stay more comfortable. We needed only to ask.I discovered El Portal while researching Sedona hotels that would allow us to bring our dog. They not only allowed the dog, but catered to her and her needs. Our room was adjacent to the Dining/Great room, and our girl slipped out the door every chance she got. An aging Therapy Dog, she wanted to meet everyone:  adults, children, other dogs, and the lady who made the awesome bacon every morning.  There was no admonishment to control our dog -- only gentle petting until we came to fetch her. Next time we take her to visit, I'll replace her ID tag with one that says, ""I'm Cassie. Please return me to Room #__.""I loved our private patio &amp; garden, where I spent hours relaxing with a good book and my dog while my husband played golf. All three of us enjoyed sitting out by the fire pit in the evenings, which provided an almost indescribable serenity. The cost of staying at El Portal exceeded our usual hotel budget but was oh, so worth it!Stayed here for our anniversary. It was really beautiful and felt like you were staying at someone's rustic house. The room was gorgeous. They have campfires every night that you can meet and socialize with other hotel guests. Really a different experience and had a very warm feel. The only downside was they didn't have a pool and the crowd was a lot older than us. A great place to stay if you want an authentic az experience though.Stayed here in March for a solo trip of self-inflection and relaxation. They are super friendly as everyone has pointed out, and I love the rustic and charming vibe of the grounds. I was in the Molesworth suite which is in the hallway nearest the dining area. The floors can be a bit echoey so I heard the comings and goings of those staying in the room next to me. Not a huge deal since I was by myself but had this been a romantic trip it might have been a bit more irksome. I agree with a previous reviewer that they could spruce up their technology, but on the other hand most folks don't come to Sedona to watch T.V. in their room. The bathtub was amazing but I wish the shower had a covering of some type as the window faces the outside. Would definitely return.The best way to describe this place is that it is a Resort for Dogs that allows humans to stay as well.Having two Golden Retrievers, finding dog-friendly hotels and restaurants is always a challenge for my girlfriend and I whenever we vacation out of town.  El Portal Sedona offered an amazing spot for our four-legged children and us as well as a few other perks.The hotel itself has only 12 full-service suites, so it is a combination of a luxury hotel and a bed and breakfast.  As soon as we checked into our building, there was a dog-welcome package in our suite with a packet full of various dog-friendly restaurants, parks and emergency contacts.  Every suite in this hotel is unique with it's own design, set-up and amenities.  We booked the Flat Rock Hickory room which had it's own backyard (for the dogs) as well as an old-fashioned clawfoot bathtub (which the girlfriend absolutely love).  The backyard attached to the room itself was also very spacious where both the lady and I could relax while the dogs were running around and playing.  The room was so nice we didn't want to leave it for most of the day.The hotel is independently owned and comes with several unique features, one of which is the alcohol/drink bar.  There is a full stock of wine, beer, tea, coffee and soft drinks inside the central building of the resort that is based on the honor system; hotel management allows guests to help themselves to the available drinks as long as each guest writes down their suite number to the drink they take.  This would not be possible at any major chain, and another feature that really endeared to us.Another big perk to this Dog Resort is the central courtyard which all of the suites attach to.  In the evenings, all the guests of the hotel and their four-legged companions come to the central courtyard and hangout by the iron-cast fire-pit in the middle.  The hotel staff leaves around 7pm, but they also ensure a truck full of firewood is available for the guests.  We went out around 7:30pm after dinner, brought a few bottles of wine and our two Golden pups.  Nearly all 12 guests were out as well, sharing wine, stories and allowing all of our dogs to meet and play with each other.  It was one of the most pleasant vacation experiences my lady and I had with this close community feel and bonding with other dog owners.  We met four other dog-owning couples in this communal gathering that we still keep in touch with to this day.The only downside is the price.  There is a premium fee for each suite ($279 dollars for one night for our room), however you are paying for much more than just your room.  This is our go-to spot for lodging anytime we are in Sedona, and we recommend this place to all of our friends to stay even if they are not dog owners.  I have never been to a hotel/resort that had just a small community and closeness feel as El Portal Sedona.  This place fits in perfectly with the tranquil and welcoming nature of Sedona itself.My girlfriend and I stayed two nights in the Molesworth (room #2). All I can begin to say about our experience at El Portal is ""WOW. This place is awesome!"" The hotel is located off Portal Drive on the east side of Sedona near all of the shops and restaurants (literally short walking distance to all of them). You have your own private parking area right outside the establishment, and a parking pass, which made us feel very important.Our room was extremely spacious, with a King-sized bed, a huge couch, flat screen TV, mini-fridge, and the best bathroom I have ever experienced in a hotel/resort. The tile work in the separate shower was exceptional. There was lots of natural light from the big windows and amazing tile in the main room. It felt like a MASSIVE studio apartment.As for the staff, every single time we would leave to go out, the staff made sure to engage in pleasant conversation with us. We filled them in on all of our travels, and they made recommendations of their own. It really made the experience feel like we were staying at a good friend's house instead of a hotel. Additionally, the outdoor area was pleasant, with nice grass, chairs surrounding a fire pit, and the sound of birds chirping in the distance.Another great perk is the ""honor system"" for snacks, food, etc. Instead of room service, the establishment has a book where guests can sign in, using the ""honor system"" to take whatever they want from the kitchen (drinks, snacks, etc.). This worked out well when we needed that emergency bottle of wine at night.All in all, we will definitely be back at El Portal during our next visit. There is no other place like it and we would feel cheated staying anywhere else, given the location, the luxury, and the exclusivity that we felt there.It had been some time since I was able to get away on holiday.  Searching for a pet friendly hotel, (my four legged child is a great dane.  kinda can't sneak him in anywhere) I stumbled upon El Portal.  I had planned on only staying one night but extended my stay for another night.  Not only is the hotel absolutely magical and wonderfully pet friendly, the people are so lovely and full of suggestions.  I will definitely book a longer stay next time.This place was amazing from start to finish. Very warm and cozy and the owner was very friendly when he checked us in. They have 2 very loving Basset Hounds that greet you when you arrive and the fire pit in the courtyard was a great place to have a glass of wine and meet some of the other guests. We ended up talkingg to a couple from California over probably ""too"" many glasses ofwine for a big chunk of the evening. This would definitely be a place that we would go back to!We loved our stay at El Portal. Our pup was welcomed and given the five star treatment and of course we felt the same. The whole staff was so friendly and helpful and we loved all of their recommendations for hikes and restaurants. We stayed in the Grand Canyon room which had a wonderful soaking tub with jets that was perfect after long days of hiking Sedona. We also loved sitting by our fire reading and chatting and it made for a very cozy experience. We ended up eating at the restaurant there all three mornings for breakfast because the food was so good. I wanted to be able to package the homemade salsa and take it back to L.A with me. The location of El Portal is also very convenient and we loved being able to walk over to nearby restaurants and galleries.This place hit the spot for us. Girlfriend and I brought the dog and could not have asked for a better experience. Breakfast was amazing both the food and the atmosphere. I love how it's tucked away behind Tlaquepaque. I think the price is reasonable.Stayed here with our dog in The Hile Sept 2014. Although the place is charming and unique and great for pets, I felt it was way overpriced for what you get. We could not get our wireless access in the room. We had to go outside in the courtyard to log on. Also if you want coffee, the hotel does not provide coffee pots in the room. You have to walk over to the ""Great Room"" and pay 2.00 for a cup of coffee from a Keurig machine. The refrigerator in the room was very tiny. We couldn't even stand up a bottle of wine in it! The tv was so small and so far from the bed you needed a pair of binoculars to see the screen. The bedding was old and actually the whole place was old. There were cobwebs in the outside light fixtures , cracked walls, loose tiles and the place seemed dirty overall. For the prices they charge it should be impeccable. Would not recommend this place.I am writing this review a year too late. I stayed at el Portal near the end of 2013. I returned to Sedona recently and regretfully stayed with a competitor. El Portal is a real treat for the senses. The owners Connie and Steve who are frequently on site have crafted a masterpiece amongst natures' majesty in Sedona. The site exudes warmth and soul . From the rooms, to the courtyard, to the fabulous lobby , to the flavorful brunches; attention to detail and service are unmatched in Sedona. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a stay at el Portal! ( also look up Fran Duda at innervision for an unparalleled spiritual experience!!)","Breakfast served to the public. Excellent food and service in a cozy lodge dining room with large windows and garden exposure. Wild bird feeders. Pet friendly.Unless you like barking dogs, don't go here for brunch. I couldn't believe they didn't post that dogs are allowed in here for breakfast. It's not cheap, and yet you have to get your own coffee. Unbelievable! Not that good and service is mediocre. Why bother? Go to Ken's or Secret Garden Cafe just yards away. I asked why the dogs rather politely and was rudely treated. Never again.We had an absolutely lovely 2 night stay at this boutique hotel.  The staff (Terrie and owner Steve) could not have been more accommodating and helpful in every way.  The rooms are stunning, with attention to the very last detail.  The grounds and courtyard are peaceful and serene.  And we at breakfast here both days and the cook is first-rate.  We cannot wait until we have the chance to come back to Sedona and will definitely stay here again.If your willing to spend the money than you wont be disapointed! Great place to stay.. loved Boomer, the hotel greeter! It felt more like we where staying in someones home than a hotel.We will be back!We went here for breakfast because it was close to where we were staying in Sedona. I like dogs but I don't like to eat around dogs. And you will need to LOVE to eat around dogs to eat here. We sat down and after observing for a few minutes got up and left before ordering so I cant comment on the food. Looked like a neat place, but it was just lost on me.Great spot for those who appreciate a small and quiet property, attention to detail in decor and comfort, and central location. The owners have appointed the hacienda to a very high standard with each room uniquely furnished.  We liked the fire pit in the center of the courtyard with an ability to socialize and meet other guests. I agree with others that some sort of complimentary (continental style?)breakfast would be a popular add-on for the price.A home away from home! Heart-warming &amp; charming hacienda!   We instantly fell in love with this inn. We stayed at Flat Rock Hickory for 2 nites and Arts &amp; Crafts for 1 nite. Every room is very unique. Our puppy, Joni Mitchell, also had a fun time and enjoyed the luxury of having her own private backyard. We recently got married in San Francisco City Hall on Sept 4, 2012. Afterwards, we drove straight to Sedona for a short honeymoon.     It was hot &amp; humid during our stay. So we didn't mind staying in our rooms, watching old movies or hanging out on their patio. Steve &amp; Connie also have a collection of movies that guests can borrow.  Staying here made feel like we were visiting our relatives. Thank you Steve &amp; Connie for providing us such a housewarming place to stay. We will definitely come back again, perhaps later in the year like November to see the Autumn leaves.Beautiful and quaint with excellent customer service!   Right in the heart of everything, you can chill with a glass of wine in the lodge with other guests (many with dogs) or in your spacious room with a fire and private patio.  We're thinking of spending Christmas here every year!This beautiful, secluded, and relaxing respite was absolutely perfect for a weekend get-away from the Valley during the hottest weekend of August. The owner of El Portal, Steve, was welcoming and full of information as he guided hubby, myself, and our Aussie straight to our room. Yep, it's a dog-friendly or I should say dog-welcoming place. Perfect! Cool flagstone flooring with enormous exposed woodbeams acorss the ceiling; masterfully tiled bathroom with a walk in shower and tiny jacuzzi tub and copper sinks. Super cozy, and it even had a patio. The happy hour refreshments were delicious - skip the quesadilla and focus on the olive mix and homemade salsa - wow! This intimate lodging is within walking distance of both Tlaquepaque and its beautiful shops and the touristy shops of downtown Sedona. The scenery is second to none and I couldn't be more relaxed! Thanks El Portal!Stayed there recently with my sisters and it was very nice.  I chose the Govenors Suite as there were 3 of us and it was very spacious.  Only suggestion would be to have coffee maker in the room.  We could of put on the cozy robes that were provided and gone down to the loby but was too lazy -we were on vacation.   I would stay there again.Best quasi B&amp;B I've ever seen, very dog friendly, a little weird with the hot water.Small twelve room motel with some very involved owners and staff that make it sort of like a B&amp;B. We stayed in The Hile room, which was beautiful and quiet. Dogs are welcomed with smiles in most of the rooms and the great room. For food, they do an honor system for coffee/beer/wine/sodas in the great room, you take something and write down your name. The do serve real breakfast, but as of at least June 2010, no longer serve lunch or dinner like the other reviewers mention In the afternoons, they have complementary finger food and some reasonably priced wines. Drinking in the courtyard is a great way to spend a couple of hours before dinner.  Also, the owners brought out a bunch of ducklings and fenced them in a small area of the grassy courtyard. Our dog was convinced they were specifically for her to watch and play with (we didn't let her play with them.) I cannot say enough good things about the service. There were a few odd things about our visit, while they serve coffee, it's only available after about 7AM. Also, it seems the hot water for showers and such is only available in the morning, no idea why.My husband and I came out here for the weekend with our two dogs. The room was adorable, the property was welcoming and cozy, we helped ourself to some of the wine and cookies in the lounge/lobby, and El Portal is located in the perfect area since it is within walking distance to shops and restaurants. Not only were our dogs treated like family (they even received a cute welcome basket with very useful goodies and treats!), but the staff accommodated our unfortunate circumstance, which we appreciated so much. We had to leave after our first night there due to a death in the family, and they did everything  possible to make our early departure seamless. Fortunately, the room was even rented out that night and we got some of our money back. Once we returned, we also realized that my husband left his sunglasses in the room in the chaos of our hasty departure. When he contacted El Portal, they immediately found them and shipped them back to us in California. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Sedona, and we hope to return and spend more time there in the future.If you can swallow the price tag, everything here was very nice and warm: the people, the inn, the service. Need something in the kitchen, help yourself. Our dog was truly a first class citizen. We'd gladly stay again but it may be a while before we can afford Sedona. That said, everyone should stay here once. Loved it.My boyfriend and I made a reservation here the same day we arrived. Our bungalow/ room was adorable with a nice pool and shower and great design! Was in September and super cheap ($120) for a private little building with a private patio, a tranquil courtyard and very personal and trusting care from the staff. We felt like we were in our own private resort. Would love to go back!!Just spent four nights here in Room 8, ""Junipine.""  This place is awesome. Only 12 rooms. The architecture, design and build quality is amazing. Steve, the owner/designer is a great guy. Breakfast is awesome, too. It's located sort of within Tlaquepaque and puts you within walking distance of many excellent galleries, shops and restaurants. This is my new, favorite Hideaway Hotel. I'll be back again and again!Room #4 Arts and Crafts is beautifully appointed, but one of the LOUDEST rooms I have ever stayed in.  You hear every footstep of the guests above you, and when they flush the toilet, the WHOOSH of the water seems like it is going to come down on your head while you are laying in your bed. This is unfortunate, because we came to Sedona for some peace and quiet, and while we were willing to pay top dollar at a highly recommended ""resort"", we did not get what we paid for. Very nice on the surface, but whoever constructed this place forgot to use insulation of any kind.Make sure you get a 2nd floor room if you choose to stay here.UPDATE:  I mentioned to Steve, the owner, the issues I had with room #4 and asked if we could be moved.  He was very sympathetic and apologetic and offered to move us to room 9, a second floor suite. We gratefully accepted the offer. When later in the day we went to pick up the key, we were told that #9 had been sold by another front desk person, so we would be in #8.  The room was a first floor room, not a suite, but no one was overhead. His main concern was for our comfort. We stayed in #8, the night of the incredible rain and snow storm. We had a peaceful night.  The next morning, to our surprise, our second night was comped because of the hassles. An extraordinary gesture that we did not ask for, but because of Steve's concern for our comfort, I will return and will happily spread the good word for El Portal. I do believe that you will have a genuine and personal experience should you visit. And by the way, the rooms are beautifully appointed. Thanks again to Steve and staff!The Flat Rock Hickory is the nicest room I've ever stayed in, and I've stayed at some very nice places (believe it or not).  The only thing missing is an ocean view, but hey, its Arizona.  There is a lot of attention to detail in this place, and the walls are adobe!  The only thing that's a little different is that they allow dogs, which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it.  The room was clean though, and they actually give you an empty fridge so you can put your own food or drinks in it.We stayed during a road trip with our dog and it was beautiful. Everything was perfectly done and the gardens were beautiful! The only issues we had is that breakfast is not included in the price ($200) nor is a happy hour etc. It would have been nice when you pay that kind of money to get breakfast or a glass of wine. The owners are very nice and we would definitely return.We stayed here for one night, on short notice, in September.  We endorse the more recent comment below.  Our room, #10, was as nice as any we have stayed in anywhere in the world--and we have been fortunate to have had suites in many of the finest hotels in the world.  Everything was great!!We recently stayed 2 nights at the El Portal and were very impressed.  The rooms were immaculate and designed in Southwest style that was tasteful, not kitchy.  We had the feeling we were invited into someone's home, not just staying at an inn.  Although the inn is located yards from the road, the courtyard is very quiet and peaceful.  We spent a couple of hours relaxing with our favorite beverages from the honor bar after a day of sightseeing (the drinks are reasonably priced).   We had breakfast one morning and were not disappointed.  Everything was cooked to perfection, the apple-wood smoked bacon was delicious.  If we return to Sedona, I can't see staying anywhere else.  The El Portal is perfect for a relaxing time in Sedona.","Primarily a deluxe bed-and-breakfast inn, it also serves superb dinners on Friday and Saturday nights that are open to the public by reservation only. Eating here provides non-guests an opportunity to lounge in the serene courtyard and attractive living room and get a sense of what it's like to stay here. The short menu usually includes about a half-dozen entrees and an equal number of appetizers and salads. We shared an order of baked brie with roasted garlic and raspberry-chipotle sauce, then enjoyed pinenut-encrusted halibut with smoked jalapeo-papaya salsa and lamb tenderloin with a pinenut-mint pesto for our entrees. It's elegantly casual . . . or is it casually elegant? Either way, it's a wonderful alternative to the restaurants in town.",,,"['quaint', 'cozy', 'place', 'years', 'visited', 'favorite', 'places', 'earth', 'find', 'jewel', 'back', 'saw', 'owner', 'wife',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/wyndham-sedona-sedona-3,Wyndham Sedona,4.0,$$,21,"Stayed for two nights in June on an all girls trip.  The gentleman at the front desk who checked us in was very nice and helpful. We were assigned a nicely updated two bedroom unit overlooking coffeepot rock, the only thing ruining the view was the unsightly and obnoxiously lit rear of a lumber yard, some privacy trees would definitely help.   We took two great tours through Wyndham, a city tour and a Vortex tour and both guides were outstanding.  The pool was great (salt water?)  Had comfortable beds.  One of the nicest Wyndhams I have had the opportunity to stay at.  Sister attended a 90 min presentation, she appreciated the lack of excessive pressure. She received a decent gift certificate.  Avoid the overpriced native jewelry sale at the hotel  (for beautiful Indian jewelry go to the Dairy Queen parking lot outside of Sedona on the way to flagstaff and buy direct.)I am not a big fan of staying in hotels to begin with but I do admit I get a bit of pleasure coming back from a long day out and finding my room straightened up, my bed made and fresh towels on the rack. Well, if this is something that would also give you pleasure don't book here at Wyndham Sedona. Apparently, unbeknownst to me, their main business is selling timeshares. I thought I had booked a room at a hotel... you know a real hotel! I came back from a long day of vacationing and guess what - my bed was not made, my towels were still on the floor, and the place was still as messy as I left it in the morning! I called front desk to ask what happened to housekeeping services. The woman on the end of the line said they were a time share resort and that they don't offer daily housekeeping, as if that was plain to everyone else but me. Oh sh*t my bad. That explains it. I'll just launder the towels myself.""  What?! Nowhere on their webpage or my reservation confirmation did they say I had to do chores and pay to do it!Right from the start they tried to sell me on a timeshare, offering me deals if we would just sit through their 90 min. presentation - why the F were they telling me this? Why would I want to spend my precious vacation time sitting through a spiel that I am not interested in? We were invited to their wine tasting and chocolate mixer. What a flop. We were treated to little chunks of fudge and an assortment of cheap wines from the local Safeway supermarket.Their rooms are nice enough, kinda like a little apartment-not that I want to or needed to feel like I was in an apartment when I am on vacation. I wanted to be in a HOTEL and to be treated like I was in a HOTEL. Well, I can see if you have a bunch of punk kids tagging along on your vacation you may want to cook and clean after them.  Kinda like the best of both worlds. You can vacation AND do house work! But for me no thanks.Next time? Find me at the romantic little inn on the other side of town.This place ended up exceeding my expectations. Based on the photos on their website, the place looks very dated. I'm not sure if simply got a nicer unit or if the resort really needs to update its photos, but it was a very pleasant surprise to walk into a totally updated unit. We traveled to Sedona for my sister's bachelorette party. There were 5 of us total and the 2 bedroom condo was the perfect size for us. In fact, it was really spacious! We were in the 2200 building and even though we didn't have much of a view, the balcony was really nice to have for our morning coffees. We arrived at 2 a.m. after making the 2 hour drive from the PHX airport. Since I'm from Minneapolis, it was actually 4 a.m. in my time, so I was pretty worried about the late night check in process going terribly wrong. But it ended up being super easy... just make sure you call a few days before your arrival to let them know you'll be arriving late. They have a security guard available to give you your keys and tell you where your unit is. It went smoothly and quickly. Here were some of the highlights of the place: - Large, updated kitchen with pretty much all of the pots, pans, etc. that you need to cook a meal - 2 bathrooms (one with a large jacuzzi tub that we didn't end up using) - Washer &amp; Dryer and soap to use - Comfy beds - 24 hour heated pool - Great location. It's not right by the main drag of downtown Sedona which was great because it's very tacky-touristy and we ended up wanting to stay away from that area altogether - Within walking distance to several restaurants, bars and coffee shops Negatives: - The only real negative is that this is a timeshare which means they'll try to convince you to attend a 90 minute session about timeshare ownership. We had to go pick up new keys the following morning after we arrived for our official check in and while my group waited in the car to go to breakfast, I was trapped into a spiel about attending a 90 minute timeshare presentation. When my sister came in and faked that we had reservations and needed to leave, the guy wasn't happy. Turns out you have to be 28 to purchase a timeshare, so I'm not even old enough in the first place to do it. Anyways, I understand that this is part of staying at a timeshare, but even after telling the man that we definitely wouldn't attending the presentation, it was hard to get away. Another reviewer mentioned paper thin walls... I never heard another soul, so we definitely didn't experience that. The Internet does kind of suck which wouldn't have mattered except I was traveling with grad students who needed to use it for homework. It was an overall great experience and I'd definitely stay here again. Sedona rocks!Great room great price or great views and service.  Kitchen was nice room was moderately clean upon arrival but tub needed scrubbing.  Second day of four found a dying cockroach in the kitchen.  I'm understanding that sometimes you control the world especially the insect world.  It was dying and they scooped him up fast.  Would have been five stars if it weren't for the dying cockroach.Very good location. Close to shopping and grocery stores. The rooms a great. We stayed in the two bedroom, and it was very roomy. Loved that it had a full kitchen for cooking.  The beds could have been a little more comfortable, but overall it was a great stay.Hum.... Let's begin with the phone call asking if my parents are able to check in before us, since we would be driving in hours later. It was denied unless we paid a $45 fee. Strike one. Then comes checking in.... My husband, an owner on my account, wasn't able to check in since I was the one to make the reservation.  So they needed me to do the checking in. I was told that Wyndham has tightened up on the policy.  What!?! Really my husband can't check in anymore even though he is an owner on the same account? The manager, Carla, sat in her office located behind the check in never did come out to resolve the issue. BIG strike 2. Check In took over 45 minutes. Strike three. All which could've been shortened had Manager Carla bothered to be involve with the situation, rather than sit in the back flexing her muscles, as the other check in lady ran back &amp; forth behind the door getting some type of orders. This situation bothered me so much I felt I had to write a review. I am actually thinking of selling my resort ownership ( owner for 15 years) , and still might if the other resorts customer service dropped to this level. Awful management at this location. First time in all these years was I let down by Wyndham resorts.Stayed here twice once in 2009 and once a week ago. The service here is fantastic! They go out of there way to get you what you need and despite it being a time share they do not pressure you to go to their time share pitches. Perks The pool and hot tub are open 24 hours a day All the rooms have a kitchen All rooms have king sized beds The deluxe rooms have patios and 2 people Jacuzzis in them the views are awesome Decent Gym Located near the grocery store and a few of the better restaurants in Sedona Parking is plentifulGreat place to stay for a week! We enjoyed Sedona and we had the view of the mountains from our porch. I liked the ""kid"" rule or ""quiet hours"" - This was extremely helpful as the walls weren't the most soundproof, but everyone seemed to respect it. The tub was great! We had all we needed to just really eat there if you wanted to. The pool was great. Only regret... that we didn't use it more while we were there. Good place to stay!I stayed here for four nights with my fiance and her parents a couple of weeks ago while visiting Sedona.  It was actually my second time staying here for a decent period of time.  This time around they had just refurbished the rooms and they looked pretty decent.  Having the two separate bedrooms each with their own bathroom is nice and then the kitchen, living room and outdoor patio just put a cherry on the top.  The first time that we were here we had a room that overlooked some of the famous red rocks although this last time all that we had was the road.  What is nice about the Extra Holidays is that they also have a nice pool, always have something going on every night and have board games that you can borrow.  That last piece was especially important the last time that we were there as it rained all 4 days and so we ended up borrowing the board game Trouble from them.  Yeah, when was the last time you played with the pop-a-matic bubble?  For me it has been years but I loved it.  The only bad thing that I can say about this place is that the refrigerator broke down the last night that we were there.  This was fixed by moving my fiance's parents to another room the next day with a functioning refrigerator since they were staying for a longer period of time than us.The bottom line for me is that I would stay here again in the future.  It has a great location as well as good amenities and customer service which makes this the perfect place to stay in the Sedona area.Needs a little updating.  Views from rooms in the 1100 and 1300 buildings are beautiful!Very nice!  Would definitely come back!  Great location, nice rooms.  Internet not so great though.  Would recommend!This is a nice property with a beautiful view. Our one bedroom suite was very roomie and had a great balcony where we were able to enjoy a nice homemade breakfast with gorgeous view. Nice big jacuzzi tube which I enjoyed. Wish the bedding would have been cotton duvet with a down comforter. Customer service was good. Great hiking that is fairly close. Town closes down early so head out on early side. Loved the restaurant Elote and A Day in the West off road adventure.Great place to spend the week in vacation.  Our unit was 2 bed 2 bath and had large living room with patio.  Very clean and accommodating for a week's long stay.  The kids love it!Ahhh... where to begin... It actually pains me to write such a low review about a property that should easily get 4 or 5 stars.....Let's start with the positive:1. The location-- the location is great! It's centrally located near everything. Also it's a very beautiful location with amazing views.2. The outside of the property is very well maintained.3. The staff is very kind and helpful.4. The room comes with a kitchen (full of dishes and cooking supplies) and a washer and dryer--big plus!5. Beautiful property with business center, pool, workout facility and game room! Now for the not so good...The actual problem with the property and my reason for the low score, lies inside of the room. Despite how beautiful the room is, THE WALLS ARE PAPER THIN!!!! We had a hard time sleeping because we literally heard every single thing that went on in the room next door. When the people next door sneezed, we head it. When they ran their shower we heard it. When they opened their door we heard it. Now there  several different people that checked in and out of the room next door to us (we knew this bc we would see them leaving and new ppl arriving and hear the maids cleaning/turning over the room), so the excessive noise was not the result of a really noisy person, it was a result of a poor construction---PAPER THIN WALLS! Not to mention if you were doing something in the living room/ kitchen and you were in the bedroom with the door closed you heard EVERY SINGLE THING- from the dishwasher running, the microwave running-- it was almost like there wasn't a wall separating the rooms because you could hear every single thing. The cable connection wasn't very good, it kept cutting in and out on certain stations--super annoying. Finally, perhaps the most annoying part of the room-- the toilet! You would think you were flushing an industrial toilet with loads of waste in it; due to the excessive amounts of noise the toilet made when you flushed it. It was absolutely ridiculous the amount of noise the toilet makes when flushing.Aside from the poor construction of the room due to the paper thin walls, it's not a bad place to stay. A huge plus for the location is the location-- it's smack in the middle of town.  So if the noise is something that won't bother you then is this place is great. If you think the noise will bother you, I suggest bringing earplugs.Me and my wife spent our honeymoon at the Wyndham (3/22-3/24 2014). After the weeks leading up to the wedding, then having the ceremony and driving up to Sedona to arrive at the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable our room was. The bed was like falling into a cloud. It was so comfortable. Having a washer/dryer, kitchen with bowls, pots, pans, silverware, etc was nice to have since all we really wanted to do was relax in our room. I called the day before to confirm the reservation and asked for a room with a view. I got a room with a view and to our surprise, a gift from the hotel which was a bottle of non alcoholic wine, drinking glasses and chocolates. Just the right touch. Andy, Jill and the rest of the staff I encountered were very nice, knowledgeable, helpful and very kind. I do plan on coming to this hotel again in the future and I would recommend it to anyone. We had a great time!Cons: For some reason, my cell phone would not connect to the WiFi. Might have been too far from the source, but that is okay. But there are computers in the lobby with internet access.I wanted to extend my stay one more day, but I was told I could not extend my stay for one day. I had extend for 2 days minimum.. Bummer but still doesn't change the fact the hotel resort is nice, clean, relaxing and the staff is friendly. I will still rate 5 stars.Great resort, professional staff, conveniently located, quiet, and clean.  We were in the 2400 building on second floor, nice views of red rock mountains.  The kitchen came with just about every kind of pan or utensil you'd need to bake a cake, casserole, lasagna, etc.  Washer and dryer were handy, everything seemed to work fine.  Didn't use the pool, but the pool and area, and actually ALL the facilities (workout room, game room, library, etc) are spotlessly clean.  I would recommend to anyone, and would go back again definitely.Another beautiful resort! Definitely would recommend to anyone. Nice that pool and hot tub are 24 hours. Friendly staff. Clean rooms. Great views.We booked through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> and I was more than pleased with property. I was amazed at how spacious it was and clean. The staff is very friendly and the rates are more than reasonable. I would love to return. We stayed there March 5 through March 9th for my daughter's wedding. We loved it!Can't give zero stars. Booked in March. They had no record of reservation in July when we called to check since we hadn't received any information. They rebooked us at The Sedona Real. We checked in with Wyndham yesterday. All looked good. We went over to Sedona Real and were told our reservation had been cancelled on the 9th.Just got back from the Wyndham Sedona and had a great time. We were there only 2 nights, but really liked it. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well appointed. The resort has a nice pool and a  decent workout room. There was some nice hiking close to property. We will definitely be staying there again.","The place itself is awesome. It's about a 10 min. drive from the Hotel to the Mainstreet where all the shops are located. The views from the rooms are fantastic! Also, the amenities are worth the money you spend to stay there. We stayed there on a girls weekend and it slept all 5 of us more than comfortably. The room had a Jacuzzi in the Bathroom, Plush, clean towels were laid out for us all to enjoy the pool with, and all of their soaps and shampoos were from Bath &amp; Body Works (one of my favorite brands).  The room itself was massive. Two rooms actually in a condo style apartment. Full kitchen and 2 King size beds. The pool was empty (I was shocked!), and clean. Also, the Jacuzzi was fabulous after a long day of driving and/or activities. They also offer a game room with air hockey and fuuz-ball. The only issue I had was that they didn't tell us that check in wasn't until 4pm. So we wound up arriving at 2 and had nowhere to put our stuff. Also, we had an activity @ 5pm so we cut it a little close. This wouldn't have been so bad, but the staff wasn't that nice about it. Once we checked in, they seemed to call and attempt to be attentive. However, upon first impression (which we know count), I was put off my the front desk and their unfriendly, unaccommodating behavior. All in all, I rate this spot 4 stars. Good, and almost great, but still highly enjoyable.",,,,"['nights', 'girls', 'trip', 'gentleman', 'front', 'desk', 'checked', 'nice', 'helpful', 'assigned', 'nicely', 'updated', 'bedroom', 'unit',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-inn-above-oak-creek-sedona,The Inn Above Oak Creek,5.0,$$,48,"From the time you arrive to the time you check out and all the time In between the staff is welcoming, friendly, and always making you feel like you are at home.   Each room has its own decor with personal touches. Great location with breathtaking views and grounds. Nestled right on the creek, you don't have to travel in order to enjoy nature; just sit on the deck or on you balcony. When the owners say they want you to feel like you are at your home away from home, they mean it!!!  My highest recommendation of any establishment I've ever been to so far is given to the Inn on Oak Creek!This is the absolute Perfect location for a romantic getaway to Sedona.My husband and I booked last minute and all the nice hotels were booked and actually I only found the Inn on Oak Creek due to a Trip Advisor search - all the travel sites listed them as sold out BUT when I checked their website, the smallest room was still available (YAY!) We are young and well traveled in Europe so the warnings of ""small"" hotel room didn't phase us at all... I am so happy to report that room is gorgeous and has everything one could need including literally the most comfortable bed EVER!The room was not really too much smaller than an average hotel room, it's just the Inn on Oak Creek primarily has suites so it seems small. But it's so worth it!The breakfast of scones, muffins, fruit, yogurt, coffee and juices was SUCH a great asset as are the amazing views from the deck and most rooms! The friendly guys that operate this wonderful place have an amazing design eye and knack for cozy goodness. We went in May but I can imagine how wonderfully cozy the main lounge would be at Christmas. Over our 2 night stay we went to the Grand Canyon (a full day) so we didn't get to lay around the inn too much but definitely enjoyed the grounds and breakfasts daily. We would absolutely return!Highly recommended!We booked the Oak Creek Suite on our recent getaway to Sedona. This was our first stay at this establishment. The suite is two stories with private balconies overlooking Oak Creek. There are many areas to walk and sit near the creek. This is a very nice boutique property. Upon arrival we were cordially greeted by Brooks who showed us to our suite and explained all the amenities availableThe suite had a king bed (most comfortable) and very large bathroom downstairs while the upstairs had 1/2 bathroom and a kitchen that was straight out of the Food Channel network. Brooks explained that it had been used for culinary demonstrations at one time. Comfortable furnishings, Internet service, big screen TV both upstairs and down complimented by gas fireplaces. Extremely clean and most relaxing. Serene and relaxin overall. Look forward to our next visitLooking for a romantic getaway in Sedona? Start at the Inn on Oak Creek. Located on the bank of Oak Creek that runs through Sedona, The Inn on Oak Creek is true to its name, every room in this quaint inn has a view of Oak Creek. In addition to the view of Oak Creek, the corner rooms also have a view of the Arizona hills that are so famous for its spectacular sunsets.  This intimate inn takes the romantic feel of a bed and breakfast and combines it with the professional feel of a well-run hotel to give their guests a truly enjoyable lodging experience.A continental breakfast is served every morning. Various flavors of Keurig coffee are available in the lobby 24hrs a day. There is also an assortment of teas and fruits in the kitchen along with a refrigerator that is available for guest use. In case, you are wondering what to do in Sedona, there is also an extensive library of travel and hiking books targeting the Sedona and Arizona area. After a long day on the hiking trails or shopping in uptown Sedona, you can go back to your room relax in the Jacuzzi tub and then enjoy one of the movies in the inn's DVD collection. The decor inside and out is elegant, well maintained and tastefully up to date. This has to be the most enjoyable hotel I've stayed at.Next time? I would not stay anywhere else in Sedona.When my boyfriend showed me images of the Oak Creek suite as a potential option for our anniversary trip, I basically laughed at him. The promise of 1,200+ square feet, with a full kitchen (and by full I mean 12 barstools along an island full), living room, and multiple balconies, was something that I thought was far above our budget. Instead, we found reasonable rates, and I can honestly say that after some research, we chose Sedona for a destination based on the Oak Creek suite and accommodations at The Inn Above Oak Creek.The booking process should have been a first clue that we were in for a great trip - the online booking was down when we tried to book our stay (causing a mini panic attack), but when we called the Inn and spoke to Brooks, he was warm and welcoming, even via the phone. The warmth of phone conversations, which added to the excitement of the trip continued when I called for some information about our suite and spoke to Wakyna - during this phone call, I mentioned that BF and I had booked dinner reservations at Timo for our anniversary, and asked for her opinion (she approved). She also recommended Indian Gardens Oak Creek Market during this phone call, which ended up being our favorite breakfast/coffee spot. Even before meeting us, Brooks and Wakyna were so sweet, thorough with answers, and extremely helpful. They also surprised us with a bottle of wine upon learning we were there for our anniversary, another touch that was so unexpected and sweet. The Oak Creek suite was stunning - words can't even express how incredible and breathtaking the suite is. It's two levels, with a private entrance and beautiful entryway. Upstairs, you have an open concept layout with a dining table, windows wrapping around the living room area and opening up to a massive balcony that overlooks Oak Creek, a kitchen with massive island, 12 barstools, Viking appliances, and a hallway that leads to a half bath for the upstairs. The pictures you can see on the website don't even do it justice - the place is absolutely stunning, filled with natural light. We didn't spend as much time here as I wish we had, but the full fridge was a huge bonus, as was the Keurig. Downstairs, the flooring switches to carpeting, but the full windows continue, which overlook the creek, as well as the downstairs balcony. The bed is a king, there's a huge mounted TV on the wall (above the fireplace), there's a massive walk in closet with plenty of hanging space, and the bathroom is literally the size of some NYC studio apartments, complete with double sinks, a jacuzzi tub, and walk in shower. There's also a washer/dryer in the unit, which we did take advantage of as to not have to come back home with a suitcase filled with dirty clothes. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, and the linens on the bed were absolutely incredible (Anthony and I still want to find out where we can buy them - they were so soft and perfect). The Inn itself serves a continental breakfast each morning with oatmeal, pastries, juice, coffee, and tea. We didn't really take advantage of this breakfast, but it seemed like everyone staying in the actual Inn was there. There was also a jar of jelly beans that was always filled, which I absolutely took advantage of, and was a perfect added touch. This truly was a perfect location for a getaway - the staff goes above and beyond and are so accommodating (I could go on and on about how absolutely wonderful they are), the Oak Creek suite is beautiful (overwhelmingly so) and the other rooms looked equally stunning, the grounds are beautiful, and it's in a great location, close to uptown Sedona and within walking distance of so many perfect restaurants. Can't recommend more highly - definitely where we'll be staying during future Sedona trips!We stayed here with several family members and friends for our wedding in the area for almost a week. Brooks was awesome! Always ready with recommendations, umbrellas for monsoon season, Johnny on the spot with any repairs needed. The price of the rooms for the location and hospitality make this an awesome deal. We would definitely stay here again. In fact we gave our wedding centerpieces to them to put on the tables for the other guests to enjoy! All my friends and family enjoyed their stay as well!We stayed here for a quick 1 night when we got to Sedona. What a great spot! The staff was super helpful and Brooks put us in room 11 which was lovely. Beautiful View from jet tub and balcony. It was our anniversary so we thought we would grab a quick bite to eat. Brooks suggested the Mexican place a crossed the street. It was not so great. To be fair we went kinda late. Just mediocre food. But back to the inn, the breakfast was very nice and was perfect after I had done a bit of yoga down by the creek. So peaceful and serene. Overall just wonderful. Would def return and recommend!From the second we walked in the door we felt like family. Amberley even greeted me by name as we walked in! She sat down and went over everything to do and see in Sedona with us, gave us recommendations that were excellent and was incredibly friendly and helpful. Our room was gorgeous. Immaculately clean and comfortable with a beautiful view of the river, a cozy fireplace and a giant two person tub with jets. The inn itself was relaxing and quiet with very nice guests and a nice baked goods spread in the morning. Plenty of tea and coffee whenever you want and a lovely living room downstairs which also has a view of the water. Both of the ladies at the desk were beyond helpful and even gave us freshly baked cookies when we checked out. I absolutely give this place my highest recommendation which is rare.  Enjoy your stay!I am remiss in not having done this review sooner. My sisters and I went to Arizona on our annual sisters getaway. We landed in Phoenix and first stop was Sedona. Quite honestly, I wish we had booked our entire stay there. I spoke so highly of it that a friend from Colorado just booked a 3 night stay there with her husband. I can't wait to hear about their visit! Spence the owner is as warm as his smile and was most helpful. I am bummed that I can't remember the gal that checked us in. She welcomed us and after our long drive suggested that we get comfortable and then come back to talk about things to do. She was very helpful. Just welcoming, friendly and homey all around. While it is no longer a bed and breakfast, it is a quaint, homey, inn that you can sit in the open room with coffee and tea and jelly bellies available 24/7 and a lovely continental style breakfast with bagels, pastries, oatmeal and juice in the morning.  I padded down in my jammies every morning and chatted with the other guests. The two adjoining rooms were perfect for us and nicely appointed. Be sure to hang out on your deck or in the chairs by the creek maybe with a glass of wine and watch the ducks land. There was a wedding across the creek and the fairy lights made it even more special. We wandered and walked around town and the shops. Had dinner at Elote which is a must! An amazing inn with a warm and inviting atmosphere where you want to hang out before and after a long day sight seeing! We'll be back!Enchanting small motel with a view and balcony over creek with ducks. Rooms are cozy with inside hot tubs (some double person) and fireplaces. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. They make you feel like you are their sole concern. The staff came across as genuine, and sincere. We were under the impression they really cared.When asked they came up with good hiking options for us and provided clear directions with maps.We wanted orange juice for a late afternoon lunch long after they had put it away, and they provided some no problem.They were flexible and responsive to what we needed.They moved lugguge for us and brought the heavy suitcases Downstairs for us. We did not ask them to do it, they asked us if they could do it for us.Bring your own robe though, none provided as of yet although they are considering adding them, they were very open to a few strategic suggestions.Great location.Across from art galleries, native rug and jewlery stores, and nice although pricey restraunts.  A few miles to great hiking trails and scenic drives. Joint living room open to all has a 24 hr fireplace, tv, and snacks.Booked this place for our anniversary trip and I am SO glad! Received and email en route to Sedona asking about arrival time so they could make a late arrival package for us. We arrived around 6 and found it right on the front door. As we walked in we were greated by warmth, a fireplace, comfortable couches and 24 coffee! Such a cute place. It was easy to find our wonderful room with a creekside view and little balcony. Amazing views from our windows of fall leaves, the beautiful red rocks and creek.Good size room with fireplace,  queen bed, and amazing gacuzzi tub! It made me nervous at first but we showered while looking out upon the view! Cool!The owners are amazing. A small breakfast of bagels, muffins, pastries,  fruit, yogurt and oatmeal is out every morning at 7:30. Then they can assist you with any place you would like to go!We loved that we could walk to almost anything, the main downtown area as well as some interesting bars. This was such a great find!Our stay was good but not amazing. Stayed for 3 nights in 3/2014. PROS:-The continental breakfast is generous with bagels, pastries, oatmeal, and juice!-The rooms are all well decorated and clean.-The toiletries in the bathroom have a separate shampoo and conditioner.-The beds are super comfortable and the towels in the bathroom are very soft!-Free parking lot with plenty of spaces-A gorgeous gorgeous view of oak creek!-Coffee all day available in the lobby-Good prices!-Spencer himself is a major pro of this hotel.  He recommends hikes and patiently answers any questions you might have! A great and friendly welcome!CONS-The rooms were cold as Sedona in march is 40s at night and 60s during the day. They didn't turn the central heat on and we were all frankly miserable and frozen. When we requested the heat to be turned on, Chris was full of excuses (it's difficult to time the heat with the sun setting, sedona temperature is fickle, etc). The bottom line is that your tenants should not freeze on vacation!  Amazingly, the following night, he STILL did not turn on the heat until another couple complained...and he gave them the same speech! Ridiculous. You would think they would remedy it and turn on the heat before everyone froze. Then yet AGAIN the next night, he also didn't turn on the heat until someone complained. The low that night was 40F.-The wifi worked about 50% of the time, depending which room you have and it is sloooooow. I actually turned my wifi OFF on my phone bc it was slowing it down. If you are reliant on wifi to do work, do NOT depend on the wifi here. Other couples we met were having similar problems. -There's no front desk as this is not a traditional hotel. We couldn't find anyone after 5pm to help us with the above issues! It turns out Chris lives next to the office. It's just a bit odd to knock on someone's front door. As a normal person with normal manners, it feels uncomfortable and a bit rude. I wish they had a better contact point, like a hotel's front desk.Overall a pleasant visit but this place is definitely still working out some kinks!First time at Inn on Oak Creek. First, the rates are much lower than other local hotels. Host greeted us at the door and gave us a quick walk around. Nice lodge-looking place. Room #2 was quaint, with balcony overhanging Oak Creek which was brimming with ducks. At one point we counted 60 ducks. The view from the balcony was gorgeous. There are red rocks in the distance, aspen and sycamore trees shading the area, bunnies and swifts during the day and bats at night. The room featured a queen bed, fireplace, jacuzzi bathtub and a table/chair set.  The ceiling fan had a remote control. The TV went ignored but was available. Although they didn't serve breakfast, there was an assortment of bagels and pastries, plus fruit. There was a kuereg and OJ as well. The location was key for us. Right on state route 179, close enough to Tlacapaque, Upper Sedona and a couple of restaurants was perfect for us. Although we never got the host's name, he was helpful in recommending sights, restaurants and shopping. When we went hiking, he provided us with a monthly pass which saved us $10 - nice touch. The next time we are in Sedona, we will be sure to stay at the Inn on Oak Creek.Beautiful Inn, terrific staff and a great location makes this a perfect place to stay in Sedona. Book early and ask for creekside room for best experience. The kitchen has a frig for guests to keep your groceries.Loved our stay here for our 10th anniversary. We were in room 7 which is a ""red rock"" view room. Our room had a king bed, 2 person jacuzzi tub, gas fireplace and a balcony with a bistro table and two chairs. The room was perfect. It is the smallest of the standard rooms, but was still plenty big, and the beautiful vaulted ceiling made it feel larger.Brooks was great at check in making sure we knew where the best hiking spots were, to confirming we had chosen one of the best restaurants in Sedona for our anniversary dinner. We even had a special note in our room from him.We had planned on going out for breakfast, but ended up eating downstairs each morning. The pastries, bagels, yogurt and fruit were enough to make us not want to go out. Sitting on the balcony over the creek and looking out at the red rocks was perfect.The location of the Inn was great, we were close enough to walk to Tlaquepaque or Creekside if we wanted to, and uptown was only a short drive away.We will definitely be back, and you can bet when anyone asks us about our trip to Sedona, this is the first place we talk about.I can't imagine staying at a better place. The staff (Amberli and Victor) is friendly, resourceful, and very enthusiastic. The place is spotless and has a fantastic view of the creek and surrounding mountains. A small, warm feel located close to some of the best restaurants, art galleries, and hiking trials in Sedona.My husband and I had a GREAT time at the Inn on Oak Creek. We stayed here for one night to celebrate our 1st Year Wedding Anniversary and it was such a nice experience. From the moment we arrived, Brooks (the house keeper) was so welcoming and accommodating. He gave us a quick run down of Sedona by marking up a city map and circling all of the places to visit. Our room was very quaint and peaceful. We stayed in one of the rooms along the creek and a beautiful view of Sedona. The fireplace and especially HUGE jacuzzi tub were a major plus for our experience! The night of our anniversary we found out that our car battery had died! We didn't want to ruin the night so waited until the next morning to call AAA. Unfortunately AAA was booked solid and we couldn't find any local auto shop to jumpstart our car. Luckily the inn owner, Spence, was a godsend and was so amazingly kind. He went out of his way to find jumper cables (even walked across the street to ask to borrow some jumper cables) and really wanted to help us in whatever way possible. His assistant, Andrea, was extremely kind and helped us jump our car and we were on our way home. This was, by far, the most welcoming hotel we've ever been to. From the moment we stepped in the door to the moment we left, the staff was so incredibly kind and welcoming. It felt so nice to be welcomed by such genuine people. We would absolutely stay at the Inn on Oak Creek again and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone!Great little place, perfect central location, nice staff. Real personal touch without that ""I'm staying in a stranger's house"" B&amp;B feeling. A Memorial Day visit meant that the roads were choked with thousands and thousands of cars, so it was really nice to be somewhere that was walking distance from good restaurants (Creekside) and hikes (Marg's Draw). We were only in Sedona for one night, but when we go back we'll probably stay here again.I can't even begin to express how happy we were with our stay here. My husband booked us a room for our 10 year anniversary. (Which also happens to fall on the busy 4th of July weekend) He said brooks went above and beyond to accommodate us for our special weekend. We had a sweet note wishing us a happy anniversary along with a bottle of wine and chocolates in our room. My husband had ordered a massive bouquet of roses for me and the staff made sure it was nicely displayed in the room for our arrival. The customer service here is unbelievable. It felt like we were staying with family. The room is updated and are very clean. I also loved the fireplace and the jet tub...Not to mention the Gorgeous views from the patio. We will def go back again very soon! And again thank you to the staff and owner for everything!We stayed in the suite for two days. This was our first time in Sedona and it certainly won't be our last. Everybody at the Inn were all very helpful. The inn is conveniently located within walking distance of several shops and restaurants. If you can, get the suite, it's 1300 square feet and comes with several amenities. We love this place so much that we are already planning our next trip here.","I was looking for a place to stay for my husband and my first wedding anniversary. We wanted something scenic but close to all the major attractions. I also had my heart set on somewhere right by the water. The Inn On Oak Creek fit the bill! My husband and I drove in on Saturday morning and after hiking all day received a call from Brooks letting us know our room was ready. The location was perfect and after walking through the giant copper door we were immediately welcomed. It's a super cute inn with a slight bed and breakfast feel. Very nice furnishings and decorations. After we were checked in we were shown to our room which had a wonderful view of the creek. We were in room 6 on the second floor. The room was very comfortable and clean. After getting settled in, we heard a knock at the door and there was Brooks with a bottle of red wine and a note wishing us a Happy Anniversary! How sweet!!! The evening was quite and relaxing. There is 24 hour access to the kitchen downstairs which came in handy when we needed ice after dinner. In the morning we went downstairs for a delicious breakfast. I enjoyed fresh coffee, some fruit and a bagel while my husband devoured what he said were the best cinnamon rolls he's ever had. If you are looking for a unique place to stay in Sedona with some of the best views of Sedona, stay here! You won't be disappointed!We were warmly greeted by Spence who have us some tips on what we should see while in sedona.  Every idea he gave us was spot on.  The Inn was so fresh, clean, tastefully decorated, and exceptionally comfortable. We had a king size room and it was very large with a fireplace and beautiful bathroom with soaking tub.  The location was perfect for walking to town as well.Our luggage had been rerouted from our flight, and the Inn accepted it before we had arrived in Sedona and it was waiting in our room when we got there.Sitting out on the balcony with a bagel each morning was an extra perk..a quiet and relaxing way to start our days of hiking.  This kind of Inn is the exact experience I would want anywhere I travel, friendly staff - exceptional accommodations - and a feeling like we were at home here.From the get-go, we were blown away by the outstanding hospitality of Brooks and his team at this Inn. From the extensive knowledge given to us about the area (such as the best hiking trails, tips on how to get a seat in one of the best restaurants in Sedona, etc) to giving us some of their last amount of Pu-Erh tea since they found out we are tea lovers, The Inn stands head and shoulders above. The accommodations were beautifully presented, from the small deck overlooking the creek, to the hammock on the bank for use by guests to the shared galley kitchen we felt at home.We stayed in the #3 suite with the cute fireplace and jacuzzi with windows looking out onto the creek.Lastly, my wife is Chinese and what was a pleasant surprise is that Brooks also speaks fluent Mandarin, too!I booked this inn to surprise my sweetheart with a nice romantic getaway. By far one of the nicest places I've ever stayed. I definitely recommend staying in there suite room. I so appreciate this place and the staff were AWESOME! I can't wait to get back!! :)had a lovely two night stay in April - emailed when it looked like we would arrive after the 6pm official closing time and almost immediately got a phone call back saying ti was fine and where they'd leave our room keys and instructions etc. As it was we got there at 5:45pm so it was fine.We had a queen creekside room, view over the creek was sublime, room was clean and substantial in size with a little private balconey on which we enjoyed a chilled glass of wine at sunset.Bathroom had a jacuzzi bath which was AWESOME! Ugh so sick of this country having such tiny baths but both of us could fit in this - we tried and we did and it was brill.Decent continental breakfast though we had to ask other guests about using the kitchen facilities etc, but that was fine. The big deck looked fab but we just got up and went hiking so didn't really utilise it.It's a fairly quite place and we felt like we were the youngest patrons by a god generation or two (we're in our early 30's) but as we were sans kids that was fine by us really.Would def stay againI would probably rate higher but the reason I am not is because of just a couple of minor things. First off, we were there from 7/11-7/14 and stayed in room 5 which is at the top of the steps. During our stay they had repainted/restained the handrails and at the time of our stay the top stair which made it very inconvenient. Also the carpet at the top of the step was very dirty and could have used a good cleaning, Overall though the views were amazing as the Inn sits right on Oak Creek, we would definitely return.We stayed in room #9, and had the BEST stay.  We originally were planning on staying at L'Auburge or Enchantment, and then decided to switch gears.  We are so glad we did! Not only were the rooms more updated, and decorated more beautifully, the customer service was by far the best we've ever received-ever- (stayed at many 4&amp;5 star resorts in the past), the location can't be beat, either.  Walking distance to shops and restaurants, this is the premier place to stay while visiting Sedona.  HIGHLY recommend!This place is great! My wife and I came for our ten year anniversary and love the quite and private rooms with balcony overlooking the creek! Will was beyond helpful with service, food and activity ideas. Beds are very comfortable and rooms are clean and modern. Location is a big plus. My only complaint is an A/C issue that was addressed right away and the single serve coffee bar... We will come back!We had an incredible stay! We arrived late, after the front desk staff was no longer in the office, but we had received a lovely phone call letting us know that this would not be an issue. The key, as well as a really sweet note, awaited us. When we had a question upon arrival we easily reached someone at the # that had been provided and the person who responded was gracious and helpful. The decor is really beautiful, the place is spotless, the staff is attentive, and despite the fact that we had booked the   ""bonus"" room which we were told was tiny it surpassed all our expectations. The Inn is a perfect place to stay while visiting Sedona!Let me start off by saying their website is not up to date and the accommodations have recently been updated.  The prices also do not match up but they are cheaper than what the website lists.  From the old pictures this hotel is much nicer and I can tell the new owners want to turn this place into something much nicer.  The rooms are awesome and have been recently renovated.  Spence, the owner, went out of his way to make us feel at home and gave us suggestions of things to do in Sedona.  When we arrived after hours he left keys to two rooms (1 was bigger than the room we originally booked) and let us choose which one we wanted.  The hotel only has 13 rooms, which gives it a B&amp;B feel but with hotel accommodations.Being right on Oak Creek, the hotel has a great little spot on the creek with chairs to just relax and take in the sounds of the ducks.  My suggestion would be to grab a bottle of wine or some beers from a liquor store and just sit and enjoy the creek!Overall, if the wife and I make it back to Sedona then we will definitely be staying at this hotel again!Very nice, cosy and clean B&amp;B. Great location and parking for free. Amazing views on the Oak Creek. Situated right next to the interstate, yet very quiet and peaceful. Tastefully decorated. Fireplace and jacuzzi in every room, nice toiletries and comfie bed. We got room 7, which was very affordable and appropriate in size. Even though we did not have the prime creek view, we enjoyed our little balcony overlooking the road and Red Rocks. Small but sufficient complimentary breakfast (bagels and cream cheese, fruit, fresh pastries,  coffee and OJ) was a huge plus, as we could enjoy it on the BEAUTIFUL big balcony (this balcony was for the common use around the clock, with amazing view on the creek,  fantastic company of hummingbirds every morning and amazing stars at night). There is no classic reception desk, yet there was a 'late arrival box' and Spence was still kind to greet us at 10pm arrival and everything was prepared perfectly. The atmosphere was great, very home-like. The owners were attentive and helpful, yet not pushy. Awesome value for the price. Hope to be back!Great experience here. Beautiful, comfortable rooms. Amazingly helpful and knowledgeable staff. Tranquil setting by the creek and centrally located. Highly recommended.I just want to start by saying I don't normally write reviews but based on our recent stay I wanted to go out of my way and write a review about this place.The hotel sits right on oak creek (beautiful scenery), is in the middle of sedona so it's the perfect location.  It has a great deck for sitting and watching the ducks swim below.  Room was really clean and bed very comfortable.  Staff was nice - almost felt like we were staying with family in one of the rooms.We only stayed for one night but our expectations were more than exceeded.  The other reviews on here are spot on - great place would definitely look here first if we ever come back to sedona!Had a great experience!! Very nice accommodations, bed was so comfy.  Sat by the creek in the evening and enjoyed some adult beverages and beautiful surroundings.  Wonderful stay.My husband, daughter, and I had adjoining rooms 3 and 4. It was perfect. Everything was super clean! The balcony was great, and there was a fire place in our room.  There was a beautiful outside deck for the continental breakfast where we watched humming birds. The coffee is available all day with French Vanilla creamer. Spence and Will were very accommodating even though we never met them. The only odd thing was that they steam cleaned the carpet in our room and it was still wet: minor issue. It was a great experience and we would go back.Beautifully well appointed inn. Great service. Beautiful rooms. Friendly.  Georgeous views. I highly recommendThis was our first stay at a small hotel/B &amp; B. The inn is recently under new management and they were great. The view was perfect. We had the angular room (best room they have). The decor is rather....out of date...like 1970s out of date and has that whole country home style vibe. No fear though, the new management plans on revamping the interior decor soon to bring it into the 21st century. We only stayed one night but really enjoyed it. Easy to get to, great view and great staff makes this one place we'll definitely be staying at again.No bar, no restaurant, no room service. Great location and nice rooms, but lacks the amenities I need. You'd be better off at Enchantment or L'Auberge which are full service resorts at comparable prices.What an amazing place, especially for the value!We stayed one night after three nights at L'Auberge.  That is significant because our room view at Oak Creek was far, far, far superior than L'Auberge and for nearly 2/3 less the cost!  The bed was super comfortable and the house was immaculate and updated.  Loved the colors in the room, modern but soothing.  Location is perfect, (walking distance to Elote which is the best food we have had in Sedona or maybe anywhere!).  Liked having tea and coffee available in  The lobby at all times.  Had a nice continental breakfast too.  The owner greeted us and was very nice and welcoming. Would recommend this place and love to return for several days.Cons: there is no coffee maker in the room which is undstandable,  given the great price.  However, by 6:45 am Thursday morning I tried to use the lobby coffee maker and could not get it to work. There was no water I. The reservoir so I thought that was the problem.  I filled it and still could not get the machine to work.  I would suggest having the innkeeper fill the water to the appropriate level the night before as I may have unintentionally messed the machine up.I also wish there were reading lights on both sides of the bed, and mentioned this to the owner.  The space on one side really is tiny though, but I would sacrifice beauty for the privilege of both of us reading n bed!This is a great place to stay when visiting Sedona. Centrally located, walk to everything. Small and intimate right on Oak creek. So much better than the big time share resorts with their constant sales pitches.","We are in agreement with all the good things said here. We went in February and stayed four nights, the first of which was our thirty-fifth anniversary. We also enjoyed the continental breakfast, the coffee, and the views of the creek, taking a creek side room.The advantage of the small hotel, at least in this case, is that the owner is your host. True, it's no longer a bed and breakfast, but it still has that general feel. In addition to the helpful guidance concerning the sights and recommended hikes and restaurants, Spence went an extra mile for us.Our daughter, unknown to us, called ahead form Chicago and spoke to Spence, assuming he was the concierge. She asked for advice on buying a gift card for us to a restaurant of his recommendation. When we arrived, we mentioned a restaurant that had been recommended to us, the Mexican restaurant in town, Elote. Later that evening we passed the office on the way to take another hike nearby. Spence came chasing after us in the parking lot, asking if we were headed to that restaurant. We said no, and he said that was good, as he had just been there and the lines were really lo-o-ong. We thanked him and went our way.When we returned to our room, we found a bouquet of flowers and a gift card to Elote from our daughters and son-in-law wishing us a happy anniversary. Spence had gone home by then, but confirmed his ruse the next morning. He had been at Elote as he said, but had been buying the gift card and had not had time to get it into our room with the flowers. He stopped us so we would benefit from the gift.Anyway, no pressure, Spence. Hope the cost of a nice review isn't that you are run ragged with such requests, or you will need to hire a concierge.Thank you, though.Got a room with a balcony overlooking the creek, which was so relaxing and beautiful. The balcony was also very private, and we could only see trees, the river, and the beautiful red rock around us. Additionally, the bathroom came with a huge jet tub. The owners are incredible kind and helpful, and I love that you can just walk into the kitchen at any hour of the day; there's even a special fridge for guests. There's also tons of boxes of tea and coffee free at anytime of the day or night. I've always been a backpacker/hostel traveler, but this place offered the comforts of a nice hotel, with the coziness, and family-like vibe of a hostel. Also, if you don't get a room with a balcony, no worries, there's a huge deck on the 1st floor. The location is also perfect. I would definitely stay here again. 100% recommend. Stayed in July 2014.My boyfriend and I stayed at the Inn for about 4-5 nights, and it was simply lovely.  Our room was decorated beautifully and was a comfortable/relaxing haven for us.  Outside our balcony were ducks and a breathtaking view of Oak Creek. The location was great- we were able to walk to nice restaurants and a shopping areas.  Uptown Sedona was also really close (a really short drive- a few minutes maybe).  All the hiking trails and other areas of interest (movie theater, etc.) were within an easy driving distance.  The warm hospitality of management (Chris and his staff) made us feel right at home.  As probably the youngest guests at the Inn, Chris made us feel very welcome and happy that we chose to stay at the Inn.  Also, they always have hot tea, coffee, and water for guests which is a huge plus! It's those small details that made our stay so comfortable.  Breakfast usually consisted of fruit, bagels, and sweet treats.  We absolutely loved our stay, and are already planning our next trip out to the Inn :)Beautiful B&amp;B with view over the creek. Every room is themed. Very warm welcoming, breakfast was delicious with possibility to eat on the sunny deck. Mike was really nice and helpful to find a dinner place and the warm homemade chocolate cookies were fantastic! Really quiet and clean, I would definitely come back.When you visit this Inn, try the golf on the rocks! Big bed awesome creek view and nice continental breakfast serve in the morning free.Wife tells me to get off my lard ass and go to the gym.  My knee begs to differ.  Never heard of YELP until last month, now I am a postin fool.  The ol lady and I had a good time, No, I mean really good time, stayin in this place.  I thought the price was high until I saw our view.  The view meant the curtains stayed open.  Had to turn out the lights soon after arrival if you know what I mean.  Women eat this sh** up.  Spent two full days in the hot tub and got all shriveled.  Turned into a well tanned prune.  God what a view.  Seems like a lifetime ago.  Never been back except in my dreams.  Rode past on the way up the canyon last year and almost stopped in.  Only regret we hadn't reached Sedona a bit earlier or we may have stopped off before hittin Flagstaff.  The ride up the Canyon is just to good to miss at sunset.  Damn I love this place.Having experienced staying in each of the separately themed rooms, the best room -without a doubt- is the ""Angler's Retreat"".  It is the only room you can enjoy the view from inside the room. Although it has changed ownership, still appeared to be well managed. The only negative would be the small room size with limited storage capacities. This presented a problem for us due to our hiking gear &amp; luggage space requirements when on extended trips.My friends stayed there, my husband and I went over to meet them had their breakfast - sitting outside on the deck, it was just beautiful.. Great service.. so was the coffee!",,,"['time', 'arrive', 'time', 'check', 'time', 'staff', 'welcoming', 'friendly', 'always', 'making', 'feel', 'like', 'home', 'room', 'decor', 'personal', 'touches',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/lodge-at-sedona-sedona-2,Lodge at Sedona,3.5,$$,28,"We booked our room via Groupon and had hoped for a bed and breakfast type cabin feel in the middle of nowhere out in Sedona.  So, that is the only reason I did not rate the Lodge a 5...because it was strange to pull off one of the main roads in Sedona, pull through a church parking lot, and then into the gravel road/lot for the Lodge.  That threw us off a bit.  It was nice and quiet though and once we were in our room we felt like we were away from everyone else at least.But once you walk in through the entrance to the lobby/office area it feels much more rustic and homey.  Our room was off the main dining room area, so that weirded us out a little bit.  The room has a very cabin like feel with a fireplace and a big king bed with a quilt.  But it looked a little bit more like a hotel room than a sort of bed and breakfast type room.  We were pleasantly surprised by breakfast though!  The chef makes gourmet meals each morning that differ from the day before.  On our one and only morning stay we woke up to scrambled eggs with pesto, super super delicious breakfast potatoes with peppers, and then a blackberry bread pudding.  I don't think we will stay again, but that's only because we are looking for more of a out away from the main road type spot.I am very very easy-going person, and generally do not give bad reviews if it seems like a place is at least trying to be nice. My husband booked us for a one-night stay based on the rave reviews... we had the Moonflower, which was a cute little room off the edge of the main lodge. The place is run-down, at least the grounds are. I understand that in November, you cannot expect lush vegetation and lots of flowers, but the grounds were unkempt, weedy, with lots of dead brush tossed over the hillside. The bench outside our room had a gorgeous view of the rocks, but it was covered with cobwebs and when you looked down you got a not-so-gorgeous view of a bunch of dead tree branches piled up and the back of a mobile-home looking structure and AC unit. Our room was cute, I will give it that. But there was a bowl of fruit left for us (nice, I thought) with a shriveled pear and a wrinkled apple. Ugh. The bed was saggy on my side, i felt like I was going to roll off. The pillows were ok, but a bit flat. The AC/heating unit clicked + whirred all night, keeping us both up. The next morning was very chilly so we thought we would grab some coffee from the main room and sit in our room by the cute little gas fireplace. The coffee was good, very good, but the gas fireplace was broken and wouldn't turn on. When we were given a tour of the place when we first arrived the young lady took us to a table and told us it was ""off limits"" and was only for the people that were there for the juice cleanse. Seemed kinda strange. I had read about the rock labyrinth and was excited about seeing it, but another disappointment there, it was weedy and looked unkempt, as was the rest of the backyard area. The fire pit had water standing in it and some cigarette butts floating in the water. The people running the place seemed so very nice, and I hate giving bad reviews for a place that seemed to have a lot of potential, but this ""romantic"" weekend wasn't so much of that with the price we paid for the room, we should have had a better experience.Secluded, private and gorgeous. Conveniently hidden behind Natural Groceries (a fabulous privately owned grocery store), there is no need to buy anything for breakfast because the complimentary meal you'll receive every morning is just out of this world. Fresh, organic, nutritious and delicious. This morning we feasted on a gluten free blueberry pudding and eggs made with basil butter. Prepared each morning by Devon, an amazing and imaginative Chef. I walked the Labyrinth each morning and then enjoyed a view of the mountains and the chirp of birds from my patio. The rooms are clean and rustic and the bed is so comfy with really nice sheets and down pillows. I didn't see or hear another soul until breakfast where you can meet your fellow travelers. So much more than I expected as the price is so darn reasonable.I usually steer clear from B&amp;Bs, they just aren't for us.  But a travelzoo came through my email we couldn't pass up.  The Lodge was truly a neat place to stay.  Below is the deets....Positives: Cozy, rustic rooms with all the amenities Private entrances Fireplace TV (hubby and I wanted one)Friendly serviceGood locationOutside seating, and labyrinth BREAKFAST! (Gourmet different breakfast each day - delicious!) Negatives:Not the best bedWish there was a cozy blanket to bring outside/on chairI felt like it was a romantic/luxury B&amp;B.  I am glad we stayed and would return!Really nice folks and super accommodating. Took a late night last-minute reservation, upgraded us to a suite without asking and left keys under the door mat for us. Nice clean accommodations. Would recommend to a friend.My husband and I spent my birthday at this place last year and there were several problems.  First, I let them know in advance that I had food allergies and they reported that they would be accommodating.  However, once we showed up I guess the kitchen didn't get the memo.  There were NO substitutions, if you could not eat the cheesy potatoes (as an example) then you just didn't eat any potatoes.Second, each morning we were awakened by screaming, loud, children!  No, not very romantic, as they claim.  Third, check-out time is 11 am.  If the place is truly a ""luxury B &amp; B"" then it should be 12 noon.  Staff wasn't particularly friendly or helpful, and there were no birthday wishes, no nothing.  It felt like because we used a Groupon, we were basically treated like second-class citizens.  We will not return.Stayed here with my husband for our anniversary. We only stayed one night, but I loved the place! It was more like a hotel than a B&amp;B, which is what I thought we were getting.When we checked it, we got a quick (as in very fast) tour of the breakfast area, game/TV room and our room. Which was fine, I don't need to see the entire building.We stayed in the Whispering Wind room and it was very nice. We had a fireplace, flat screen TV and a pretty large jacuzzi tub. We also had our own private patio with a separate entrance so we could come and go without having to walk through the rest of the place.They had snacks out all afternoon, but we left to go shopping after we checked in, so we didn't get to taste any of them. Breakfast the next morning was good though. There was coffee, tea, hot chocolate and juice set up when we went in. Also yogurt and granola. We like the fact that we had from 8-9:30 to eat instead of having a set time to be in the dining room. Our server brought us some kiwi and grapes before bringing out breakfast. That was a souffle of eggs, spinach, mushrooms and goat cheese. Roasted potatoes and bacon served on the side. Good, however I wish you had a option to leave out ingredients if you don't want them. I'm not a fan of mushrooms at all, so I had to pick them out as I went.The only negative besides the breakfast option would have to be the shower. It took absolutely forever for the water to heat up, and while I was in the shower, it kept going from freezing cold to scalding hot. That was the quickest shower I think I've ever taken. I couldn't deal with the constantly changing temperatures!All in all it was a good stay and I would go again. Nice place, nice people, clean rooms and good food. It's also close to the shopping in uptown Sedona and Tlaquepaqe - those are just a short drive away.WOW.  I experienced nothing less than blatant false advertising with the Lodge at Sedona.  I have had experiences with unsatisfactory service or products in the past but never to this extent.  In fact, I have never felt compelled to write a bad review for any business until what this one did to me.In a nutshell:***I purchased a three-night king suite package (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FTravelzoo.com&amp;s=028bd5f8b72b65f748e44e65a01e5fe7cef45f46749720c3580173fcaad40442"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Travelzoo.com</a> voucher).  They placed my husband and me in a tiny room for two nights and finally, after expressing several times that that was not what I had purchased, they offered to ""upgrade"" us to a king suite.  In addition, they charged my card a ""resort fee"" of $137.40.  The <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FTravelzoo.com&amp;s=028bd5f8b72b65f748e44e65a01e5fe7cef45f46749720c3580173fcaad40442"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Travelzoo.com</a> advertisement for the voucher DOES indicate a 10% resort fee will be charged.  Upon agreeing to these conditions when purchasing the voucher, I assumed it was 10% of what I was paying (10% of $439).  I still don't know how they calculated $137.40 ($93 extra).  Even if this is based on their standard rates, according to their web site, that would be a total of $777 so they still overcharged me about $60.***This was such a disappointing experience because it was our first time to beautiful Sedona.  My husband and I have two kids and rarely get one-on-one time so we had to make a lot of arrangements to make this happen and I did a lot of research on accommodations so we could make the most of our little getaway.  There are so many amazing places to stay in Sedona.  I'm so bummed I got scammed by this place and missed out on the other gems in the area.  When I saw the voucher on-line, I called the Lodge at Sedona to ask about the deal and the king suites.  The woman I spoke to had me sold with such an amazing description of these beautiful, spacious suites with fireplaces.  When we arrived to the hotel, the key was left for us since there is no one at the front desk after 6pm.  To our surprise and disappointment, we were stuck in a small room--just to give you an idea, the bathroom sink is a few steps away from the bed.  In the morning, I spoke to the woman at the front desk about it.  She didn't know how to handle the situation so she asked me to come back when the next woman's shift started.  I did and she said all the suites were occupied and explained that the room we had was appropriate for the package we purchased because it had a king bed in it.  I showed her the voucher and how it stated the following: ""3 nights accommodation for 2 people in a King suite"" and reminded her of how the suites are described on their web site and how they were described to me over the phone when I called to ask about the deal.  She apologized, implied it was Travelzoo.com's fault (which it was not), and said all the suites were booked so I should speak to the manager once she was in the following day.  We left the manager a voice mail and she came to our room the following day to apologize and offered to ""upgrade"" us to a king suite!  I don't understand how you can be upgraded to a room that you reserved and paid for in advance.  So, we got to spend the very last night in the suite and then had to check out the next day at 11am.  Enormous disappointment.Very disappointed. Compared to Castle in the Country in Allegan, MI, this B and B falls short of its Select Registry status. My wife and I found this place on Select Registry's website. Due to our stay at the excellent B and B Castle in the Country (a Select Registry B and B), we had high expectations for the Lodge at Sedona. It's cleanliness and service is comparable to a small Best Western or any low budget hotel.Save your money and time and either find a low budget hotel or find another B and BI had always wanted to stay at a bed and breakfast, and this B&amp;B was everything I wanted and more. The staff is so friendly and helpful. The amenities are great. The breakfast was delicious. And the surrounding area was beautiful.I booked the room through their website for the 4th of July weekend. Their rooms are all discounted for Sunday through Thursday nights. So we stayed there on Sunday for $99 in the Sky Dance room. It was the best deal I could find at any bed and breakfast in the area.We were driving down from Las Vegas when we realized that we wouldn't make it in time for the time we said we'd check in. The lady I spoke to was so kind and told me that it was no problem: she would just leave the keys and welcome back at the front door for me. And sure enough when we got there, our keys were waiting with detailed instructions about how to get to our room and information about the lodge.Our room was quaint and simple. I loved the earthy and homey decor. It's unfortunate that we only got to stay there for one night.In the morning we were served breakfast, which was freshly prepared right in the kitchen in front of our eyes. It was so fresh and delicious - better than any hotel breakfast you can get. I would love to stay at the Lodge again. Exploring Sedona was one of the most memorable vacations my boyfriend and I had. I hope we get to visit again!Anticlimatic stay. Price is not indicative of the [lack of] quality of the Inn, the [lackluster] customer service, or the premises. Non-existent check-out procedure. Guests pay the inkeeper for the complete stay just as they arrive. I find this quite distasteful.I flew into Sedona for my Solar Return birthday and decided to stay here.  I had the StarGazer room.  It was so cute!  It had a huge jacuzzi tub that I liberally used.  It also had an outdoor shower, but it was a little too cold at night for me to use it.  Maybe next time :)All the innkeepers and the chefs were really nice and friendly.Of course since this is a bed and breakfast, you get breakfast in the morning.  The first morning I was served a scrambled egg with chives, 1/2 pumpernickel bagel with this fantastic sun-dried tomato spread and a 1/2 dollar-size salmon patty.  Okay, there is all the tea, coffee,granola &amp; yogurt you can eat, but I need more than 1egg, 1/2 bagel and a 1/2 dollar-size salmon patty.  I heard some woman behind me saying, ""Oh wow, I can't possibly eat all of this!""  Really??  I asked for another plate.  The waitress/innkeeper was really nice and said it was no problem, but they were portioning the salmon and had to give me sausage instead.  Fine.  I think I would have been fine with just 1 whole bagel, 2 eggs and 2 of those 1/2 dollar-size salmon patties.  But, service was great and the chef apologized for not having enough.The second morning I was served an english muffin, split and topped with two poached eggs, chorizo crumbles and hollandaise.  It was delicious but why not a side of sweet potato hash or something?I guess my Texas-sized appetite is not something they usually get here.My room had fantastic views of the mountains.   All in all, it was exactly what I wanted - some peace &amp; quiet me time to reflect on my new year.I would definitely recommend this place.  But, if you have more than a ""spa"" appetite, expect to go get a brunch on 89A after you have breakfast here.  :)Loved this place!  We stayed here the weekend of March 18th for our first anniversary.  Getting into town traffic was painfully slow and we worried we would not be able to get to Elote (restaurant) if we stopped to check in at the The Lodge.  We called ahead and were assured that our keys would be waiting for us whenever we did actually arrive.The room was super nice! No complaints at all!  The breakfast served was great and the staff made accomodations for us to have breakfast in our room as it was our anniversary.  We would definately stay here again!We arrived late in the evening, and Linda waited for us  and welcomed us as though we were best friends.  She shoed us around the grounds and the city map of Sedona.  Then escorted us to our room, the Moonflower.  The premises were sooo clean, and had many fine little touches to make it like home.  Great place for spiritual, retreats, or just a quiet getaway.  Definitely will recommend and hope we have another opportunity to return.Sorry to ruin the average here... but maybe it would have been higher if they actually let us in to stay there... we showed up with our baby daughter and were turned away after we drove all the way up there &amp; had reservs bc they don't allow kids. They told us it says so on the website but obviously not prominently enough since we didn't see it when we booked. Later, we want on to check and it does say it in super fine print - easily missable. Didn't help that the old lady at reception referred to my baby -as ""it""!!! Blessing in disguise though bc we ended up at L'auberge where you can live, breathe and revel in your offspring freely!God bless America!Our first visit to Sedona was wonderful! The lodge was warm, relaxing, comfy and accomodating. We are not usually B&amp;B people but this was all changed by the Lodge and the staff. Sedona itself was just what the Dr. ordered for relaxing and decompressing from work and recent travel. The Lodge made it extra special. We will return!We chose to come here for one night for our first year anniversary this past December.Overall, it was a wonderful experience.Our room was cozy (although this is NOT a very handicap friendly location, just so you know). It was a bit chilly, so the mini-stove in our room was welcome.  It was a bit small, but had a lovely window seat, and the theme of ""Dreamcatcher"" made it all the more endearing. The bed was very comfy, and I loved the little journal that guests have written in throughout the years.The snacks and apple cider in the lobby were welcoming, and we really enjoyed getting to walk the labyrinth together.  The grounds were beautiful, with lots of lovely little nooks to hang out, cuddle, and connect with nature. My one issue was that both on the phone and upon check in, they asked about special dietary requirments. Both times, I explained that I was a vegetarian who didn't eat eggs or gelatin.  However, at breakfast, the choices were meat, eggs, a muffin and/or yogurt (which usually has gelatin). So while my partner loved her breakfast, all I had was a muffin.  This wouldn't have bothered me so much except that they'd clearly made such a big deal of asking me my preference that I had expectations that were not met.We had a lovely time and hope to get to come back to visit (but I'll remember to bring granola bars for breakfast this time).Great place, from beginning to end. Very warm and friendly staff. Breakfast and snacks were amazing along with the atmosphere. The king / jacuzzi suite we had was very clean (First time we stayed at a hotel and didn't take the comforter off the bed)...Very nice decorations and detail, not like a cheap carbon copy room at a hotel. All in all, very comfortable, quiet, private bed and breakfast with great food, facilities and atmosphere.This review is a little delayed but better late than never. My husband and I stayed here to celebrate his birthday in August 2010. Before then, we had little experience with B&amp;B's and weren't quite sure what to expect. Upon our arrival, the owner was warm, welcoming and kind. There was even a birthday card and treat in our room after we checked in. Our room was cozy, comfortable and wonderful. We were disappointed it was too warm outside to take advantage of the fireplace! Our private patio was perfect for star gazing. Breakfast was delicious. No continental, donuts and cereal meal here. Homemade, unique and a great way to start a busy day in Sedona. We will absolutely stay at The Lodge again when we return to Sedona.Had a short weekend getaway at the Lodge at Sedona to escape from the Phoenix heat.  This is hands-down my new favorite Bed &amp; Breakfast in Sedona! All of the staff was very kind and welcoming.  I took my dog and he was spoiled too! They gave him a goodie bag when we arrived, he had a bed and towels in the room as well.  When we went to breakfast in the morning they gave him special dog-friendly scrambled eggs and a treat that the chef brought out herself.  For those of you who are not dog owners, not to worry, they put those of us with furry friends on the opposite side of the property so you won't hear or see them.  It really was an amazing time from start to finish. The room was very cute and had nice views. You also felt like you were set back out of the way a bit, yet it was very convenient to restaurants, store, and so on.  The staff was awesome the whole time, breakfast was awesome, the ambiance was perfect.  I have stayed in Sedona well over a dozen times and I would recommend this B&amp;B over any others I've ever been to. :)","I was in Sedona on business and stayed at The Lodge during the week.So where do I even start? The lodge features are reasonably priced the service here are impeccable. The snack bar eating was some of the most healthful, yet delicious, fare around, and by walking outside to my car, I was greeted by staff and asked if I needed anything.  They refer me for dinner reservations great Italian  1/2 mile down the street, and generally met any request I had.  Though I did not take advantage of it, other services include in-room massages and bodywork.  In short, this is the closest I think I will ever come to Heaven on Earth.  Whether or not you believe that Sedona is a mystical place (I certainly do), you cannot deny that it has a calming effect, and The Lodge exemplifies this.  I highly, highly recommend The Lodge for any type of getaway.Internet/Wi-Fi is available, and the staff is great and alway made eye contact and went out of way to aways welcome you and offer their assistance.This is the type of place you would love to like, but it is just plain weird.  Not only is it a Bed and Breakfast, it is also a healing retreat of some sort.  This is not advertised or mentioned in any of their online information, but a good number of the guests were at the Lodge for health issues.  How do I know this???  Imagine sitting down for a glass of wine in the afternoon and not being able to avoid hearing a consultation between a patient and ""doctor"" discussing various health issues.  Or imagine reading the newspaper in the great room, and listening to another patient discuss their health issues with an employee of the Lodge. . I don't know about you, but my idea of getting away is not to hear other people's problems and ailments.  Thankfully we had plans for hiking, rafting, etc. and didn't have to hear this all day long.  One gentleman wore his pajamas all the time, and although he was there to heal, he enjoyed a cigarette on the deck where we were having breakfast.   I also requested an early morning breakfast before we went rafting.  I felt as if this was not something they were happy to do.  Once we arrived and understood the full experience offered to the patients, I was really irritated.  There is someone making them food, juice cleanses, etc. on a continual basis. Sedona itself is majestic, and the wildflowers were beautiful.  The Lodge at Sedona was creepy!Very overpriced and false advertisement! The food is okay nothing special and the room was way to hot! It was hard to sleep. I don't recommend staying here in the summer because they are not able to keep the rooms clean. I highly suggest staying somewhere else.The double B (B&amp;B - duh!) usually evokes images of old-fashioned hospitality, pink rooms with quilted bed-covers and flowery wallpaper, a ever chatting host and weird, uncomfortable breakfast around the communal table.The Lodge doesn't fall in that category.Our friends had the wonderful idea of offering us a gift certificate from <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbedandbreakfast.com&amp;s=9ebc00b3a2a058d70a4641d86ef3260fec8b1c48c2436b64f87f545fc850fdc6"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bedandbreakfast.com</a> for our wedding last year. We waited, and waited and when we decided to take our trip to Arizona, I knew it was the perfect occasion to use it.Sedona sounded like the perfect location for a much belated honeymoon.The Lodge immediately stood out.The propriety is large and stands on more than 2 acres of beautiful gardens dominated by pine trees. The landscaping is just impressive. And the inn itself is built in a very elegant Arts&amp;Craft style - warm and welcoming.Very B&amp;B - but in the best of ways.Our room was detached and had a beautiful private balcony with Adirondack chairs. The Prairie Ranch Suite has all the amenities you can dream about - and a wonderful jet tub.....that I highly recommend after a long day of hiking....Comfortable bed, nice bath products, a fireplace, free wifi, TV, stereo....you name it.As for breakfast - you are free to enjoy it at your own table. The outside patio is an ideal place for it. Generous portions; the food itself is quite forgettable but it does a good job of charging your batteries to face a Red Rock day.Check out their website for specials, and do make your reservation in advance since they seem to be quite busy.A very nice place to unwind and enjoy life....the only drawback is that Sedona makes it hard to enjoy it to its fullest....when you are there you just don't want to stay in your room but go out and walk, ride and marvel!!My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights and really enjoyed the room, the grounds, and the friendliness of the staff.  We would definitely stay here again.  The breakfasts were tasty and quite healthy.  The only reason I don't give The Lodge 5 stars is that we were expecting access to a pool and fitness center (based on their website) and when we arrived found out that there was no longer access to those facilities.  Otherwise a great stay!Loved this place.  The rooms were clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated.  Every morning, we walked downstairs and were treated to an amazing gourmet breakfast (example: chorizo eggs benedict with poached pears on the side).  Then, around 5, hor dourves are set out.  After dinner, hubby and I would return to the Lodge and play board games they provide downstairs.  The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.  Everyday, someone would ask us where we went, what we did, etc.  One night, while I was waiting for hubby to come downstairs, the manager asked if I needed the fireplace lit to keep me warm.  They even have a basket with actual menus from nearby restaurants.  When we returned from a pizza joint with one of the menus to add to the mix, the manager explained that a menu from that restaurant had not been included because they only carried menus from restaurants from which they get ""consistent"" good reviews.  In other words, they weren't about to clutter the basket with menus from random places - they wouldn't want their guests to be disappointed.  How thoughtful is that???  Yes, L'Auberge may be more luxurious, and Enchantment might be swankier.  However, you can't beat the price at The Lodge or the warm hospitality.I'm currently a ""local"" so I've never stayed here, BUT if you enjoy walking labyrinths, and I do, The Lodge at Sedona is home to the nicest one in Sedona. There is a little parking area at the back of the property right beside the labyrinth, so access is easy. The labyrinth is well maintained and has a nice energy about it. The only drawback is that a newer residential area is close by and I've been there on afternoons that house construction noises have made the experience less than peaceful. This is the best kept secret in Sedona!Where do I even start?  My husband and I got married here, and stayed for our honeymoon.  It is our dream to return for a vacation, sans kids, and for maybe a whole week instead of a couple of days.  Actually, it's our dream to live here.  But I don't think the owners would like it, given we come with a teenager, a baby, and seven cats.  :-)The Lodge features a reasonably priced wedding package that includes a wedding officiate, a bouquet for the bride and a boutonniere for the groom, a wedding photographer, a gift certificate for Rene's at Tlaquepaque, a gourmet breakfast, and one night's accomodations.  I loved, loved, loved our minister, Margaret Van Damme!  We are not a traditional couple, spiritually or otherwise, and we were so happy to find someone who ""got"" us in just a couple of phone conversations and emails.  She wrote the most beautiful, touching vows for us that I tear up just thinking about them.  I did tear up during the ceremony, as a matter of fact, and Margaret saved me by reading something that I was supposed to read, while making it look like it was part of the ceremony.  She's a seasoned professional for sure.Our flowers were also beautiful, very simple and elegant.  The photographer was awesome, and really worked with us to get some great shots that utilized the striking beauty of the red rocks and Arizona sunset.  We chose the labyrinth for our wedding rather than the Celebration Terrace, but either location is visually stunning.  We had two different rooms as the one we initially wanted was booked for the first night of our stay.  The first room, the Meadow Breeze, was very comfortable and featured a private patio.  The bed in that room was unbelievably lush and for the first time in months, I woke up without a backache.  The jetted tub for two was perfect for a newlywed couple and had space for candles on the sides.  The second room we stayed in, the Mission Grande, was larger and a little more luxe than the Meadow Breeze.  It had a fireplace, and a private, outdoor hot tub with the most amazing view of the mountains I have ever seen.  There is also a private entrance and we got our own parking space.  The bathroom is much more spacious in here; the tub, while large enough for just one, is jetted, the vanity has two sinks, and I seem to recall there being a bidet too (all of the bathrooms feature Lodge lotions and soaps, BTW, which are delicious and natural).  Both rooms had mini-fridges.  Right after we left, The Lodge opened up another suite that took the best of the Mission Grande and Meadow Breeze and put them together; I am still happy with what we had, however, as the view from the new room cannot possibly beat the Mission Grande.  Service here is impeccable.  Whether we were at the snack bar eating some of the most healthful, yet delicious, fare around, or just walking out to our car, we were greeted by staff and asked if we needed anything.  They took care of dinner reservations and generally met any request we had.  Though we did not take advantage of it, other services include in-room massages and bodywork.  Internet/WiFi is available, and you can also arrange for flowers/balloons/gift baskets to be waiting in your room.  In short, this is the closest I think I will ever come to living Heaven on Earth.  Whether or not you believe that Sedona is a mystical place (I certainly do), you cannot deny that it has a calming effect, and The Lodge exemplifies this.  I highly, highly recommend The Lodge, not just for a wedding, but for any type of getaway.",,,,"['booked', 'room', 'via', 'hoped', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'type', 'cabin', 'feel', 'middle', 'nowhere',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sugar-loaf-lodge-sedona,Sugar Loaf Lodge,4.0,$,35,"This is a great budget hotel. I was concerned at first when I made the reservation because there was no confirmation number, etc. However, the room was just as we reserved it and there was no problem with check in.The hotel is in a great location and the rooms were older but nice. We had a small refrigerator in the room and the water pressure in the shower was great. This was the quietest hotel we stayed in on our whole trip!There is a pool and hot tub which are great in the evening.There was good wifi and a comfortable bed. Overall a great place to stay and much more affordable than any other options in Sedona!Read about this place in a guide book a few weeks back and made a mental note. Husband and I were taking a road trip to Sedona and we rarely make reservations in case we decide to be spontaneous and do something else.  On our way into the town, we passed by Sugar Loaf and decided to see if they had a room available for 2 nights. They did. John the owner was very friendly and made check in a breeze. Even though it was early in the day, we were able to get our stuff in the room before we hit the hiking trails. Room was outstanding for a motel/lodge. Very clean. We had a king bed that was very comfortable and lots of pillows. There was also fridge and microwave, hair dryer and an iron. More than anticipated for a motel. Would stay here again. Price was perfect under $100 since we spent most of our time on the trails and not the room.Went to Sedona without making any hotel reservation... duh.... :-)   while there i jumped on my iPad and searched hotels and rates and there were nothing available or everything over $250.  We drove around and found Sugar Loaf off the road.  Looks very 60s, but when you are desperate for a room, you gotta take what you can.  We got lucky!  it was the very last room availabile.the room was right in front and the entrance was a sliding glass door and we parked our car right outside the glass door.  it has all the neccesities and it was comfortable.  we just needed the room for sleep - left the next day for scottsday.Rate $89!  you cant beat that in sedona at peak season.  wondered why the place didn't charge over $100/night - we would have paid for it.  This place is centrally located to everything.  it was quiet.  one funny thing we experienced was the front desk guy went into the room before we got in there with gloves and a spray bottle of disinfectant :-)   again, the room was comfortable.  had iron, blow dryer, shower, tv, refrigerator, and comfy bed.Great place, I highly recommend this small place to anyone looking to stay in Sedona on a budget.The nearby hiking trails are fun as well as challenging. The room is small but it is very cozy, the beds are soft and the Wi-Fi is high speed.The location is close to anything you would need, Walgreens, various grocery stores, health food stores.Great experience all around.To the people that complained, I am so sorry that they didn't have HD TV. Maybe you missed the sign out front that DID NOT say Hilton Executive Hotel of the Gods.We had stayed in several different places in Sedona, but this place is my now my favorite.It is a smaller hotel and right on 89a. You can pull right up to the room! No schlepping your stuff across the parking lot and up stairs or down long hallways.It is very quaint. The check-in area is surprisingly small. There is literally only enough room to stand right inside the sliding door in front of the counter. If there is someone else in there ahead of you, you will have to wait outside.The room was clean and neat when we checked in and nicely appointed. I like that fact that they had blue towels instead of the boring hotel white or beige. Rooms come with a fridge, microwave, hair dryer, iron and board, but no alarm clock. Wifi was fast, and the room had flat screen TV with cable. A/C worked well and was not very loud. The sink is outside the shower/bath area. There is no fan or window in the bath room. Inexpensive for Sedona. I will definitely stay again.This was a nice inexpensive hotel.  Not a lot to look at from the outside but the room was clean and had everything we needed.  Although our reservation confirmation said breakfast was not included it was. The wi-fi was great.  The pool and jacuzzi were welcome at the end of the day.  The gentleman who worked in the office was very friendly and helpful with the questions we had.  We would absolutely stay here again.I travel ALL the time for work, and have stayed in all sorts of places all across the country and beyond.  I hadn't set my expectations high for the Sugar Loaf Lodge, but they were definitely exceeded.  It is NOT fancy, but the price is amazing for the area and our room was clean and had everything we needed - including a fridge and microwave- and free wifi!  Be warned - the beds are really soft.There are few times when my (&amp; my wife's) expectations are utterly exceeded. This was the case at Sugar Loaf. We made same-day (off-season in November) reservations on our way south from Grand Canyon. Our intention was to find a simple place to crash for the night and then be on our way. Well, one night turned into 3! Sedona is a natural wonderland for those looking to get outside and connect with Mother Earth. Sugar Loaf positions you perfectly to get out and about. When it was time to come back for rest, the beds were very comfortable. As others have noted, there is an extremely friendly woman running the place. The rooms are clean, come with plenty of space and nice amenities such as free WI-FI (good too!), a microwave and refrigerator. The BEST bonus was the pool/hot tub and surrounding area. We asked to use the cute fireplace by the pool and even roasted a few marshmallows. There was a large &amp; new-looking gas grill available as well.In short, this place made us feel at home and I'd love to visit again some day. If you are looking for a no-frills spot with a lot of extra charm, you can't possibly do better!Very accommodating hotel in a great area. Surrounded by beauty and wonderful local restaurants.  We showed up early after our plans were cut short and the manager was able to let us into our room right away. It was such a nice surprise and we rejoiced to see such a welcome environment. The rooms are quaint and fit 4 people without it being cramped. The beds are probably the best hotel beds I've been in. Practically melted right into the sheets and comforter, which were also so soft and warm.  The ac is a nice way to cool down from the hot Sedona sun, as it gets quite cool in the room. The bath towels were different from the usual droll white hotel towels and the shower head ran steady and hot. Pool was beautiful and the hot tub was scorching. All this for quite a great price of $100 for four people.  Great little lodge in a great town.We went through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> and got a decent rate for a rather large king bedroom. We had a hospitable experience with the check-in desk where he not only made us feel welcome by explaining what makes Sedona great, but he also gave us great restaurant recommendations. The a/c was up to par and the pool is open late so that was super convenient. The breakfast was nothing to brag about and the room itself is due for sone rennovations so thats why Im not going to go for the full 5 stars, but overall I wish we could've stayed more than 1 night!An incredible deal for the money - clean, cheap digs with soft beds, a nice bathroom, and  even a mini fridge!  The location is great - close to a wonderful the health food store, coffee shop and Oak Creek Brewery locations (with Simon's Hot Dogs!).  Sedona has so many super expensive hotels and crappy cheap ones - this is the perfect alternative to both.  We didn't get a chance to try out the hot tub or pool, but they looked really inviting.  Looking forward to staying here again.I'm not going to tell you how awesome this little motel is. I won't tell you that the beds are really comfy. I also won't tell you how convenient the location is. You definitely won't hear me tell you how friendly and accommodating the woman at the front desk is. Or how the rooms are really quaint and clean and close to the parking lot. Or how there's a mini fridge in each room, and tv and little soaps and stuff in the bathroom. I won't tell you any of these things because it's so inexpensive to stay here and if I come in town and find that all the rooms are booked because I told too many people, I'mma be pissed!Too bad I can't do less than 1 star.  I should have known this was going to be trouble from the ""hello""; which by the way the kindest thing Jerry said to me.  Although the room  was clean, the bathroom shower head could use a bit of scrubbing.  The TV was NOT HD and shoddy reception.  When I checked into the room, I asked about places to eat and if he knew where the Wyndam Hotel was.  He grunted out some sort of response having to do with spending too much on coffee and he doesn't do timeshares.  I told crabby pants Jerry that I had my little 5 lb dog with us.  He gave me the key and sent me on my way.  We literally spent about 6 hours total in the room as we spent time in Downtown (with our dog) and at the Wyndam (also with our dog) visiting my friends who were also in town from Vegas.  When we checked out, again Jerry grunted something about the weather and off we went.We stopped on the way home for a bite to eat (next review) and I noticed a missed call from the Lodge.  I listened to my voicemail and he was rattling on about how we violated policy by having a dog and he was going to charge my credit card a cleaning fee.  OH HELL NO!  I told Crabby pants when we arrived that we had her with us.  I immediately contacted my credit card company to dispute any additional charges.  In the morning we found out that he tried to charge $50 and then tried to charge $25.  Luckily I had already called to dispute them so they did not process.  When we called him to discuss he was nasty rude on the phone and hung up on us.  I wonder how many other people he has done this to and they just went ahead and paid the fee or they never noticed it on their credit card statements.  BEWARE!  This man is a con artist and a Shyster!  Check your cc statements and make sure you were not charged for something extra.We certainly will NOT be back!I love this place.1. This place is not only clean, but updated. our walls look like it's been freshly painted the season before, and our rooms were equipped with a newly-renovated looking bathroom. The lighting is bright and adjustable.2. Affordable. Where other lodging options would have cost us $100+ a night for far less value, this place granted as a super soft comfy King (and a single bed in our room; good for a family of 3), with legit HD TV and a micro fridge + microwave.3. Convenient. It has a lot of affordable dining options around the neighborhood and we were even able to do our laundry just a block away.It's definitely no-frills type place, but it's clean, it's quiet, it has a fridge and microwave  AND free in-room wifi (which, after staying in several casino hotels that don't offer either, seems like HEAVEN), and the hot tub was definitely a plus. It's not fancy, and for penny-pinching, just-need-a-place-to-crash road trippers like us, it's definitely a lovely oasis.You want lotions and 20 different kinds of coffee served; go next door to the Hampton Inn which I'm sure you'll be pleased with the free maxi pads and tampons available for guests in the lobby restroom. This spot just isn't that.WILL definitely return.It took me all day to book a room at this motel. I called about 8 times before I finally got a hold of a (very) crabby person who stated they had people waiting and would have to call me back (and quickly hung up the phone). I never received a phone call back so I called another 4 times before I was able to book a room. For the price of 65$ a night I can get past a crabby owner. Other than that- great location- tv, mini fridge, free coffee &amp; comfortable beds. If you don't need all the bells and whistles this is a great place to stay in sedona.There's nothing charming about this little hotel, but it is pleasantly clean and bright. We had a very comfortable bed, we appreciated being able to freeze our water bottles overnight in the mini fridge, and we were pleasantly surprised by the variety of breakfast snacks: yogurts, granola bars, juice boxes and muffins. After returning from a dawn hike, it was just what we needed.Looks like ""The Loaf"" has renovated their rooms! For those reviewers knocking the place, I guess you are used to staying at the Ritz Carltons of the world. While having been there, done that, I go to Sedona to hike, swim, relax, shop, have some 4x4 adventures, and experience the outdoors. The idea of laying around some luxury resort doesn't appeal to me whatsoever, so now you know where I'm coming from. Rooms are clean, spacious, and have all the amenities you'd expect in a modern establishment- wi fi, microwave, HDTV, fridge, coffee maker, blow dryer, ironing board, etc. There's even a gas barbeque out at the pool. Located nearby supermarkets and dining choices, it's in a great location as well. While almost everything in Sedona is overpriced, this remains a great bargain and now, it's even new &amp; improved!Exactly what we wanted and needed.  Cheap, clean, quiet, all the amenities we could possibly need.  I stayed here with three friends when we stopped though Sedona on a road trip.  Close to shops and restaurants and the hot tub was exactly what we needed after a very long day of travel!found this place on yelp and we were pretty pleasedTwo queen beds, round table with three chairs, two lamps, microwave , fridge, iron and board... No coffee maker,iron &amp; board,bathroom had a nice tile counter, but not too many bath products, maybe one conditioning shampoo and two soap bars. One of those heating lights in the bathroom, mmmpool and hot tub looked great but we didnt get to use it, got in too late, but the gate was unlocked so we did go in and check it out.close enough to DT sedonna. Lady at the counter was very nice each time we called.there is breakfast, available, but it is just some oj pastries yogurt maybe fruit etc set on the counter in their very small office.  We grabbed a couple pastries and a yogurt for the road.overall, we were pretty happy with this place and the price.Check out the sugar loaf... Jerry is a super cool guy... If you are in sedona looking for a good deal....Here it is...","Whether you're a traveling student or simply looking for a low-budget place to crash in Sedona, this place is THE place to stay.Homier touches, such as the furniture and comforter make you feel a little more comfortable than you would at say, a Motel 6.Quick, clean, easy. Stayed here purely off Yelp recommendations like that other gal did, and everything turned out great. *For the record, I'm not sure whether due to Yelp criticisms or not, there is now complementary shampoo and soap. :DPlease know that I am giving this place five stars based on its category. It is not a fancy hotel. It is a decent hotel which most valuable service is that they accept pets. It is clean and the owners are delightful. Also they let you use their bikes for free. SO NICE!It's tough to find a clean quality room for this price especially in such a convenient location. For the price, you can't beat this place.Question: Were all my fellow yelpers high on peyote when they reviewed this place? From the moment my gf and I drove up to this hellhole I was worried.First the lady who runs the place tried to have us take a room that had a patio door that faced the main street. The door was not at all safe looking. Once my gf and I decided that, that would not work for us, we were taken to another crappy room. This room reeked of piss and something else that I could not identify. The room was clean, so that was a plus. The towels however looked like they had been once used at a dog grooming joint. Other annoying stuff included spotty Wi-Fi, a leaky toilet that got clogged, nasty hair in the bathtub drainer, and my favorite: shower water that went from super cold to super hot. I seriously hated this place.Bates Hotel Spoiler Alert! Stay ONLY if desperate.I can't believe anyone would give this place a 4 star rating!!!  WOW! You need to get out more.  Anyway, this awful little hideaway should continue to be hid away for the horrible service, first just get someone to answer the phone I had to call 5 times attempting to actually get to the hotel.  Then once there, the ""gent"" at the front desk was rude and lifeless (I guess I would be too if I had to work there) and couldn't care less if we stayed the 3 nights.   Not a good sign.  Once I got a glance at the rooms, we high-tailed it outa there!We stayed here on pure yelp recommendation, and their rates were far cheaper than any hotel in Sedona.  This place truly is a special spot.  Away from the Disneyland that has become Sedona's main street, and away from the mass amount of construction goings on hwy 179.  We stayed in one of the two main front rooms, which had a micro and a fridge, which was great.  Also, there is free wi-fi, so when we were researching our hiking trails for the next morning we were set.They also have a jacuzzi and pool in the rear, where you can star gaze and relax after a long hike.  It's soo quiet and peaceful.  The staff is very friendly and they provide much needed hiking fuel every morning, OJ, coffee, granola bars, fruit, etc.  With such a great price and fine location, Sugar Loaf is the place to stay while in Sedona.why would you stay anywhere else? Seriously? I refuse to overpay for anything and this was TOTALLY worth it!! it got the job done and did it great, bed was comfy and so was the hot tub! Loved it here. if you want a no frills place to stay in the middle of everything for a reasonable price stay here!! The staff was also super nice!This is, by far, my favorite place to stay in Sedona.  I'm almost hesitant to review it for fear of revealing my secret haven to the world.  I've tried many hotels/motels in the region and nearly all of them rape you.  I hike all damn day and prefer cheap, unpretentious, quality lodging.  ""The Sugar Load,"" as my friends and I call it (and as I often mistype on my laptop's keyboard), is family-run, small, humble, cute and within walking distance to a grocery store, 24-hour convenience store, clothing outlet, thrift store, food options, a drugstore with booze and an amazing Indian restaurant.  It's right in the center of Sedona so all the good hiking trails in Sedona and Oak Creek are within easy driving distance.  Rooms are clean and spacious and have microwaves, refrigerators and free wi-fi, in addition to a ""Teaching of Buddha"" book placed on top of the Gideon-placed Bible in the nightstand.  So appropriate.  The pool and jacuzzi are clean and a perfect end to a day of balls-out hiking.  I am going to wake up hungover and married in Vegas to the heat lamps in the bathrooms someday, they're that good.  In the morning, there's also free granola bars, juice, coffee, yogurt and fruit in the tiny front desk area.  Adorable.Sure, I dream of staying at the Enchantment, but the cost of one night there could buy me a 10-day stay at The Sugar Load.  I've stayed here more than 10 times and will continue to rock this place in the future.Jerry at the front desk is the sweetest and the best, by the way!Convenient no thrills place.  Clean and comfy.  No complaints.  If you're looking for things like internet or gym, this ain't your joint.I stayed here my first time in Sedona. I was on a budget, and thanks to my yelpers I found this place. It was definitely do able for me. If you're on a budget, go for it! It is a little 70's ish, but it does not smell. I love that they have a POOL and JACUZZI. It's like you have your own bungalow. Your car can be parked in the front of your door. I particularly liked that. I will stay here again. Don't expect luxury, expect comfort. Also, It is a lot closer to downtown. It's maybe a 2 mile drive.My husband and I stay at the Sugar Loaf Lodge almost every time we go to Sedona. It is homey and quaint. The furnishings are dated, but it is clean, with a pool and hot tub to boot. If you want hi-flautin this is not the place for you. If you want value and cleanliness, you are at the right place.Great place- especially considering the price.  Nice people work there too.  It was very quiet and a great night's sleep.  By far, the best priced place in the area.Recently stayed at the Sugar Loaf Lodge in Sedona. Reasonable rates for the area - rooms were $60 + tax in September. Clean, well appointed (with fridge &amp; microwave) and quiet, the furniture is not 30 years old as you often find in similar lodgings. The owner/manager was helpful and friendly. The rate included a basic breakfast (pastries, granola bars, yogurt, v8 &amp; orange juice, coffee &amp; tea etc) in the tiny office that you could take back to your room. Swimming pool, jacuzzi, the Sugar Loaf was an all round good deal - I highly recommend it.We concur.  See below.Super clean fun motel with Big TV and nice bed and bathroom.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/oak-creek-terrace-resort-sedona,Oak Creek Terrace Resort,4.0,$$,38,"We have been here twice now. The first time was with my in-laws and we stayed in cabin 17. This cabin was a cute A-frame two-story cabin that was secluded from the others and set back on the property. We had a beautiful view of the Oak Creek from our patio. There was a grill on the patio, an oven/mini fridge inside, and a spiral staircase leading upstairs to the loft.The second time was for our five year anniversary. We stayed in cabin 19 this time. It was cozy and spacious with a Jacuzzi tub. My favorite part of this place is that it is directly on the Oak Creek. Exit out of the cabin, walk down some steps, and BAM. You are at the Oak Creek. I love playing in the water, trying to find fishies, and just general relaxation on the rocks. If you don't want to be on the actual creek, there are several places near the creek to relax and enjoy the view. My second favorite part is the koi pond. I love feeding them! They are located right outside the front office. Overall, it's a great place for a mini vacation - whether it's for an anniversary, a get together, or just a quick spur of the moment vacation. Since it's off the beaten path, you can really relax and unwind here. If you want to go into town, it's just a short drive away. It's a great location!Definitely will be back. Love how close to the creek it is, and the in room fireplace and Jacuzzi were amazing. The staff are super friendly and honest. I accidentally left my new age cards in the room and they mailed them to me. Love this place.My Husband and I decided to plan our destination wedding here at Oak Creek Terrace Resort. We wanted a small intimate affair with our closest family and friends. Oak Creek Terrace rents their gazebo for a nominal fee for about 4 hours of use. We planned this out and ended up having the most exquisite creekside wedding. Our wedding party and guest couldn't keep the tears from flowing it was simply the most beautiful wedding any bride could dream up. The pictures down by the creek with the bridal party are gorgeous and unique. Besides the wedding we had about 8 different rooms throughout the property and everyone of them had their very own charm. All of my guests loved being on the property and claimed to leave feeling rejuvenated... of, course that's partly due to the said beauty of being near all the amazing energy in Sedona... but I say Oak Creek Terrace Resort is itself a hidden Vortex that you have to be staying at as a guest to truly discover all its power. I'll be back again many times in my future.Oak Creek Terrace is a quiet resort  with a beautiful  view.  surrou ded by the majestic  mountains and the calming babble of the oak creek.We started with room 12 where we had an unexpected, and unwanted, extra occupant (spider) and air conditioning  that didn't work.  The good part is that Chris at the front desk was understanding  and was able to move us to room 14, which had a better view of the creek and lights in the tree and on the patio.This was a great place for my wife and i to celebrate  our 1 year anniversary.Great place to stay in Oak Creek Canyon, Sedona, AZ. Stayed in cottage #11, which had a king size bed, kitchenette, flat screen tv, huge two person jacuzzi tub, shower, large private deck with lounge chairs, large glass table with huge umbrella and nice bbq. Room was undated, clean and in good shape. Nice stair case leads to the adjacent oak creek. Only downfall is Wifi only works in shared area. Highly recommend. Staff was super nice. They also have fishing poles for free use.On a scale of 'shitty to awesome', it was 'good'. After reading reviews we were excited about our 1 night stay, at this quirky place... Unfortunately, it fell short as far as cleanliness. It's clearly a little on the older side, (which is what we found intriguing to begin with) BUT we probably won't be returning.  On the plus side, the staff was friendly, scenery and koi pond were cool, and they offered their visitors complimentary Red Rock parking passes for daily use.Wonderful, peaceful hotel with creek access. Even picnic tables &amp; hammock on creek for guests.Very clean, although they forgot to clean our room one day. Lovely little charming get away.I treated myself to a Sedona Trip last week and stayed at the Oak Creek Terrace because I prefer rooms with jetted tubs.  My usual place discontinued those room types so I tried out the Oak Creek Terrace.  Well, the Oak Creek Terrace is now my new favorite place.  Everything about it was perfect.  The location is on 89, but it's on the very quiet end of 89, past the bridge.  There was zero road noise throughout my entire stay.  They gave me a park pass for each day that I hiked and knew the area well enough to direct me to where I wanted to go.  I stayed in room 19, which gave me exactly what I wanted: An apartment-style setup with a fireplace and an enormous jetted tub.  I even had my own entrance with drive-up parking and a private patio.  The patio had a fountain, some lush landscaping that I could see out my kitchen window, and a brand new gas grill on the patio. It was also the cleanest jetted tub I had ever encountered at a hotel.  When I arrive at any establishment, I fill the tub with hot water, a gallon of bleach, and a packet of automatic dish detergent to clean out the hoses.  Usually some pretty funky stuff comes out.  Absolutely nothing came out of the hoses which means the tub has been properly maintained and cleaned.  The water was also plenty hot enough and the water pressure in the shower was great.  Both are tough to find in privately owned places.On my last day, I explored the whole property and found even more surprises.  There is a Koi pond with a fountain.  There are also walking paths, picnic tables, and a really cool back deck with sitting areas.  There is a manicured lawn area with a gazebo and beautiful statues that looked very nice.  While I was walking around it appeared there were room types for everybody.  The rooms towards the back of the property are right on the creek and you can hear the rushing water.  These rooms also have mature trees nearby that surround the patios.  The rooms in the middle of the property have less water views and less growth.  The rooms up front are more desert-y, which is what I wanted.  I am from New England, so I'm sick of seeing trees and creeks.  I want Red Rocks and planned landscaping.  The rooms at the very front of the property are a bit more traditional hotel-style.  They still had balconies and patios, but were not apartment-looking.The place was incredible.  I loved it.Once again, a lovely stay. It was great to escape the heat in Phx and come up for a midweek getaway. I stayed in room 10, which is perfect for me as a solo traveler. Queen bed, big jacuzzi tub, fireplace (with complementary Duraflame logs), fridge and microwave. This room doesn't have a table to set things on, but I tend to grab food and eat on the patio right outside my room. I lounged down by the creek in one of the hammocks, watched the stars, and felt my stress disappear. I highly recommend Oak Creek Terrace for anyone looking to stay near Sedona, without all the new-age-y crap ;-)This was mine and my husbands first time staying at Oak Creek Terrace, and we will definitely be back. There are so many things that we loved I'm just going to list them, (along with the cons.)Pros: The gorgeous view of the mountains and creek from our second story patio.-The clear mountain air with a hint of burning leaves that wafted through our windows. -The generously sized and (CLEAN) hot tub next to our bed. -Lovely fireplace at the foot of our bed, complete with Duraflame logs replaced every day.-Kitchen stocked with grilling utensils/plates/cutting boards/cups/ etc. -Two personal patios with a BBQ grill.-The winding staircase that split our unique two level accommodations. (Room 16, get it if you can!)-Courteous and genuinely friendly staff who have great recommendations for food and shopping without coming across like salespeople. (Abby is awesome!) (They were also very quick to meet our requests for extra towels/pillows, within 10 minutes of calling the front desk.)-Free unlimited Red Rock pass for the duration of our stay. -Pet friendly, didn't feel judged for bringing our puppy in the slightest. -Lovely grounds with hammocks near the creek, (perfect for stargazing on crystal clear Sedona nights, which we did!) Cons: Rooms feel slightly run down and would probably bother some people although not us. -Our DVD player was broken, not that we were there to watch much tv anyways. (We were informed that we were in one of the last rooms which hadn't been updated tv-wise so at least they've acknowledged the problem.)-Floor tiles in both bathrooms were cracked. -Creepy figurines of children scattered throughout the grounds, (this is actually humorous if you've seen them!) -Lumpy pillows. -Slight mold in the downstairs shower. For what we paid, we got what we expected and more, it was an excellent experience and we can't wait to go back!Eh. I had such high hopes for this place.  I get that it's not a new resort. I get that it's a quaint little place nestled along a 2 lane highway with access to the creek. I also get that it's more about where it is than what it is. But could you do something about the smell??? I stayed in room 20, which looked to be their largest cabin with 2 small bedrooms and a sofa bed. I was ok with the fact that one of the ""rooms"" was a small pantry sized area with a bed squeezed in there and curtains separating it from the kitchen. I was ok with the old sagging couch. I was ok with the outdated kitchen and bathroom. But the dead animal smell that literally woke me up from my sleep was staggering. And what did the management do? ....they handed me an industrial sized spray bottle of room deodorant. Yeah.  They did that. Then during checkout the second morning, told me I could've packed up all of my things and moved to another smaller cabin. Really? Oh, and they did finally agree that it smelled like there was a dead animal in there. But that was it. Eh.We had a larger room, 4 people, 2 bedrooms very small &amp; couch bed. Only 1 bathroom, no doors on rooms only drapes on hooks. Over priced for this room, plus the uneven flooring was dangerous too. Nice location, help was considerate. Red Rock Pass was nice amenity. This was Room #20.I love this place. The ground are beautiful, the creek with all the hammocks us to die for. Great seating space throughout the property with gazebos, reclining chairs etc. Rooms are perfect with just what you need for a romantic getaway. Most of the room have a jacuzzi and fireplace. Prices are very reasonable and the temperature is always great specially during the summer. We will be  back.Horrible wi fi, old rooms with wood laminate, outdated jacuzzi tubs, shower/toilet old and run down. In a quaint area but don't want to be stuck here like we were during a snow storm. Those flat screens mentioned, as well as the fridge: tiny. Stay in town at Hyatt, better bet.My Hubby and I stayed here to celebrate our 5 yr anniversary last weekend. We were looking for something out of the desert heat, some place small and relaxing and pet friendly. This place fit the bill! They only had 1 room remaining when we booked (they only have 20 some rooms). Each cabin is unique, which I like, most, if not all have jacuzzi tubs and fireplaces and a tiny kitchenette. Ours also had a private patio and grill which was great! We got room 19.  I will start by saying the room was clean, the bed was comfy, the linens had no stains, spots, or tears. The AC unit worked great and the water from the hot side was HOT! All good stuff! Here is the reason for only 3 stars... the room needs some work. Maybe they are working on remodeling the rooms and we got the short end of the stick? Though it was clean, I'm not sure what they were thinking with the iridescent gold and pearlescent ivory paint scheme on all the walls AND the ceiling. The maroon and gold boarder in the room was peeling away from the walls, in places, especially the bathroom it looks like they have touched up the paint numerous times, yet each time the paint color is just slightly off making it looks like a patchwork quilt of tacky. The dark blue carpet was stained and in places near the fireplace was completely melted away (carpet in a room with a Jacuzzi tub just doesn't sound like a good idea anyways). In the entryway, the kitchenette and by the fireplace is nice marble tile, however, at one time it looks like they tried to clean it with something you shouldn't use on tile and it stained it which makes it look dirty... a good buff and seal would take care of this. Lastly, we decided on our last night we were going to test out the blue heart-shaped retro-looking jacuzzi tub.... after filling it (because I know how bacteria likes to hang out in the jets and who knows the last time it was REALLY cleaned thoroughly), I ran the jets to circulate all the water through it, then had plans to drain it and refill with ""cleaner"" water... after turning on the jets and letting it run for about 5 minutes, our room began to stink up. I was so grossed out by the smell, we ran the fireplace to clear the air and we skipped using the tub all together... I think it either needs to be replaced or bleach needs to run through that thing before anyone else uses it.For what we paid for the room, we thought it was a bit over priced given the state of what the room was. However, would we stay here again? ABSOLUTELY! If we tried a different room next time...The room was not what we had hopes for, but it didn't ruin our time there. The whole property is awesome! The grounds are very well kept. No trash anywhere. The creek being right there to fish in or walk along was nice! The grassy areas were all well maintained as well as all the landscaping around the rooms. The hammocks and lounge chairs everywhere made it easy to kick back and relax and enjoy the serenity.The staff including maid service were all very friendly. It was very easy to check in and check out. AND they offer a free Red Rocks pass during your stay so you can park and hike without having to pay fees at every fee area. It was a peaceful weekend get-a-way, just wished the room fit that theme as well.This place is the lowest price that you will find in Oak Creek.  And it is right on the creek too.  It is a magical little place and I love staying here.  The rooms are older and some of them are very small.  But we don't spend much time indoors anyhow.  The property is very pretty.  It is a steep downhill walk to the creek but it's not far.  They have a green grassy area too with a gazebo that is very pretty.I will definitely be back!!We called to make reservations and they were helpful on the phone and recommended a room for us. We had a standard room with a jacuzzi and fireplace. Pros:The staff was friendly when we checked in.Bed is very comfortable.Fireplace comes with a duraflame log. Matches were provided in the nightstand.Jacuzzi in room.Room was nicer and updated since the photos were posted on the website.Nice grounds: koi pond, creek, bbq, lounge chairsLocation just outside of 'busy' Sedona.Cons:No refrigerator Bathroom lay out is a little too tight - toilet nearly bumps sink.TV location is in the corner of the room.In all, we would recommend the room for a short stay for a couple.Spent a couple days here on our honeymoon.  The gentleman that checked us in apologized for all the traffic noise, but reassured us it would calm after dark.  We got a good chuckle at that, because we get more traffic by our house in one hour than Oak Creek Terrace gets in an entire day.  The room was cozy and clean, as well as well stocked, all the way down to a bag of microwave popcorn!  The view down the canyon was amazing, and just sitting on the deck on the swinging chairs was a vacation in itself.  The location is ideal, just 5 or so miles from downtown Sedona, and across the street from DQ. The only bad thing we found was that we had to come home.  We are already making plans to return.Honestly, I was a bit disappointed. I have only stayed in Room 7, so all my comments will relate only to that particular room:The bad: Cleanliness. We did find quite a few bugs in the room. Secondly, I don't think the rooms were cleaned very thorougly; I noticed a condom wrapper left by the previous occupant when we checked in - right next to my bed. Even after two subsequent cleanings, the staff did not remove it, nor did they remove the dirt and debris around the rest of the bed. It made me question how well they were cleaning the rest of the room. Access to the creek: The resort touts their access to Oak Creek as a selling point. However, that particular section was a MESS. There was a broken porch swing plunked down right in the water, and there were piles of debris EVERYWHERE. Frankly, it was disgusting. The bed: The mattress sagged in the middle, which meant an uncomfortable night of sleep that left me with back pain. The shower: Tiny, without an adjustable shower head. Which meant that if you wanted to turn on the shower to warm up the water before getting in, you would literally spray the bathroom with water. You were forced to get in, and either freeze or burn. No table in the room. NONE. We put all of our things on the side of the Jacuzzi or on the bedside. That included the coffeepot, since there were almost no accessible plugs in the room. The good:The Jacuzzi and the fireplace.Cable TVPorch swingsWe could not have picked a better place to stay at for our honeymoon. We stayed four nights in Cabin 12. It was peaceful and quiet - we have never slept better (although we do live in NYC ;)). There were families staying in other cabins, although we never heard them expect when we were outside. The room was small, but big enough for two people.The jacuzzi was more then big enough for the two of us and we loved that they provided free fire logs every night. We used the grill and had a wonderful Easter dinner. We also laid out in the hammocks by the creek which was relaxing and very easy to get to. I cannot wait for our anniversary so we can come again.","We stayed in two different properties in Sedona for two nights each and this was by far our favorite.It is quaint and charming. It feels (and is) owner operated. The jacuzzi tub was big enough to swim in and the fireplace could  be seen from bed or the tub.They decorated with wonderful bronze sculpture all over the grounds. They also have hammocks and comfortable swinging chairs to sit on to enjoy the creek.It is a little ways up the canyon, but close enough that pizza places still delivered. (We did not want to leave our room after a day of hiking and soaking in the tub.)The only reason I cannot give five stars is that they do have some technical difficulties with the shower heat, the heater and such. It is an old place, renovated, but they did not go all the way back to the bones to renovate.We will be back.This is a wonderful place to stay if visiting the Sedona, AZ area. There are hammocks down by the creek to lay in, and the rooms are awesome, affordable and the staff is very kind and courteous. The gazebo area is beautiful, and Oak Creek Terrace is the perfect place to escape to either by yourself or with a loved one. It is simply the perfect magical retreat!I stayed in Room 23 with my kids for two nights. Our girls loved playing in the creek just behind the cabin. The front desk offers free fishing pole rental so they spent a whole morning ""fishing"" crayfish out of the creek. The Koi pond, volleyball net over sand, hammocks and privacy in each cabins were just perfect for us. The only issue we had was strong moldy smell coming from the bathroom. The hotel offered to move us to a different unit, but we had already unpacked and our girls had already made themselves comfortable so I decided to stay. They ended up giving us a discount for staying in the room. Besides the bathroom issue, it was a great stay and I would go back to the same cabin even, if they fix the mold issue. :)I was impressed by my first contact with OCT.  The guy took our reservation, sent a confirmation within minutes and it spelled everything out.We met him 4 months later when we arrived.  So knowledgeable and content to make us feel welcome and part of ""the family"".We spent four days and had our two granddaughters with us.  Talk about a circus in search of a tent.  The sisters, 8 and 10, were excited about EVERYTHING.  Our cabin was everything we hoped it would be.  The deck overlooking the creek was fantastic for breakfasts and dinners.  There's plenty of room to walk around, relax on green lawns in chairs or creekside in hammocks and chairs.  If you love the sound of a gurgling creek, you'll love it here.This is one vacation we'll never forget.I must add, the lady who took care of our room was gracious and helpful to a fault.  We couldn't have asked for better service.Stayed here on my honeymoon.. The quiet location of this resort cannot be understated.  Rooms are very clean and cozy.  The location in Oak Creek Canyon is simply divine.  You're connected with nature during the entire stay as the creek isn't far from your room.  The staff is very nice, and very helpful.  I would HIGHLY recommend staying here!!  The only bad thing about the trip was having to go home.  We will definitely return.  Huuzah!!nothing as described, avoid if you can ! plenty of fine places in sedona for same price !Wow, what a great little place!!My boyfriend and I drove by on a Saturday evening so of course there was no vacancies. We called Sunday morning to see if we could get a room for the night and we were able to get a good price on a great room.Our room had a beautiful entry gate and courtyard leading to a somewhat enclosed porch with a grill and patio table/chairs.Our room had a fireplace, microwave (they even provided a package of microwave popcorn), flat screen tv, small kitchenette (as we discovered in what looked like a closet after I began frantically searching for a coffee maker), decent sized bathroom (although the shower was a bit small), king size bed  (the pillows were very nice!!! I hate to sleep on my pillows at home now, and will be looking for some nice fluffy pillows like the one's provided here!) and a jacuzzi tub (red, heart shaped). The kitchenette was very well stocked with coffee, creamer (powdered) and coffee. Nothing like those hotel chains that give you 2 sugars in a little packet. There were paper towels, plates, coffee mugs, glasses and silverware.The Dairy Queen across the street was definitely a plus for an after dinner treat!After awhile we decided to go down to the creek to relax, and to our surprise and delight there was a lawn area with a gazebo, and closer to the creek was a beach area with big trees, hammocks and lounging chairs/tables. This made for a wonderfully relaxing evening with my Kindle by the creek :)We absolutely love this place and will be back! Beautiful!I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I am dissappointed!  Prior to seeing our room at check in we were told that our room was just remodeled. Yay! .... NOT! The first night was horrible with the freshly painted room smell!! My gosh what were they thinking by putting us in there with NO FANS or ventilation??? It was BAD! When my fiance went to the office to let them know they told him they would have the maid try to do something about the smell and nothing! No fan still and one window in this room is not enough when you're breathing in TOXIC FUMES!  We took it upon ourselves and went to find a market to buy some vinegar after googling ways to help with the fumes. We put vinegar in all four corners of the room and that seemed to soak up some of the smell but obviously not all of it. Whoever did the flooring in the room was NOT  a professional because the floor dropped down like if there was a hole there everytime you would walk by the jacuzzi area into the restroom. Speaking of jacuzzi: It was not used by us, but it made some really LOUD noises in the middle of the night while we were trying to sleep like bubbling and it sounded like it was going to explode or come up from the drain. All 3 nights we were there we had the same issue and were woken up by that loud noise!!    The grounds of this place were beautiful and the bigger cabins looked absolutely amazing to stay in. As for our tiny little rooms, it was not a pleasant stay. We tried to make the best of it as it was my birthday and I love SEDONA. Definitely will not be staying here on our next visit again.This place is absolutely beautiful. Not your average hotel. Rooms are very small, but roomy, there is a fireplace and hot tub in every room. My boyfriend and I absolutely adored this place. The people who work here are so friendly too!Charming little resort on Oak Creek, just outside Sedona, AZ. Wifey and I have stayed here a few times, including 5 days on the first part of our honeymoon! Some rooms are better than others- Not telling which one we like best in case we want it on a particular weekend! Some have kitchens, patios, BBQ gills, and views overlooking the creek. There's a Dairy Queen across the road for those with a sweet tooth! Rooms also have HDTV, ours had a Jaccuzzi tub as well. You can fish in the creek, lounge on patio furniture or a hammock... Very quiet, peaceful place! Our room with the kitchen was $150. Very nice getaway spot!The little cottages are cute and cozy with an outdoor feel and if you get the right cabin, you will have a nice view of the creek. We stayed in to different cabins on our visit they were both nice. The first cabin we stayed in had an awesome blue heart shapped jacuzzi that so said 1985, but it was fun, the lay out of room was nice &amp; bed was comfy. It had a nice porch with grill. The 2nd cabin was set up a little strange, jacuzzi in the kitchen and bedroom upstairs, it was still nice. This cabin also had an upper and lower deck with great view of the creek, also had a grill.All the rooms had fireplaces, flat screen tvs, dvd players, and kitchen supplied with limited dinnerware/small fridge.The staff was very friendly, housekeeping also gave you what you need more towels,ect, The had two gazebos for all guests to use and have table and chairs down by the creek.They have all differnt types of cabins, so check there web-site for interest in cabin or room type. There is a dairy queen and vistor center across the street and slide rock state park just a little ways down the road I would and plan on staying there again.I'm not sure if I want to give this motel a 3 or 4 star review. We definitely enjoyed our stay, but we ran into a few interesting issues.It happened to be snowing, so it was really cold. We walked in our room and could see our breath. It took quite a while before we were able to get it warm.The rooms have jacuzzi's in them with some instructions, but don't mention anything about not putting soap in there. Let me warn you: DO NOT ADD SOAP. You will be shoveling bubbles out through the window, naked, for twenty minutes. Strike two with the jacuzzi is that in our one full tub we used all the water for the whole motel. How this is possible, I will never know, but we got a call from the front desk informing us we ruined everyone's night and nobody could shower.The property is really cute and they have videos you can rent for a dollar. There are tons of popular hits. Also across the street from Dairy Queen and they have a nice Koi Pond.I would come back and stay here in the summer once I felt comfortable that we wouldn't use all the hot water in the place! $105 for a holiday week day isn't bad.We have been traveling between Phoenix and Flagstaff for the week. On our second pass through Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon we had not made a reservation for the night. Our first stop was at Oak Creek Terrace. The place looked small and quaint. A lovely lady in the office checked us into a room with more amenities than we were expecting. Queen bed, real fireplace with a self starter log, jacuzzi tub, flat screen HD TV with DVD player, cable and WiFi. The rooms are smaller but have enough space for two. The grounds are attractive with outdoor TV, grill, seating, Koi pond with many large and beautiful fish. The lower terrace and river side seating/hammocks was a nice place to relax. Great alternative to chain hotels. We really enjoyed our stay!Oak Creek Terrace Resort is rustic and funky. When you first pull up, it looks like there are only 10 rooms. However, the resort spreads out to the back with little rustic cottages for a more intimate stay.There's a koi fish pond with fat, healthy koi fish adjacent to an outdoor patio. The outdoor patio has it's very own 42"" (est) television. Perfect for the TV fanatics and sports fans. The TV was still on when we returned from dinner around 10pm with only ghosts watching it. They didn't bother us, so we left it on.In the back of the resort is a huge terrace with comfy patio furniture to enjoy the beautiful weather of Sedona. From there, walk down some stairs and it will lead you to a wall full of painted lizards. F-U-N-K-Y. Then, down more stairs, you will end up in a grassy area with a gazebo. My doggie had fun prancing playfully on the fall colored leaves sprinkled across the lawn. CRUNCH.There is a creek that runs along the back of the resort. Also, hammocks are set up to kick back and relax in the warm Sedona weather.We had a small standard room with a king size bed that was adequate for one night's stay. The only bugger was that the low shower pressure. The room is equipped with a mini fridge and microwave.Overall: This is a rustic, funky, clean, and dog friendly resort. The highlight is the many choices on the resort to relax and enjoy your vacation. Oh yeah, free wi-fi!I took my boyfriend to Oak Creek Terrace last weekend for his birthday and we had such a relaxing time staying here. The rooms are nothing fancy but they are very comfortable and quite spacious. Ours had a jacuzzi, fireplace and our own large patio with table and chairs and BBQ. We grilled out and took a walk to the creek. It's also a dog friendly resort. The front desk was really friendly and helpful and even upgraded our room when it wasn't ready in time for check-in. We would definitely return here for another relaxing night away in Sedona.This place needs updating on some of it's infrastructure. We had an ongoing, frustrating time with the broken ice machine. It is old and needs replacing. It never worked when needed.We held our wedding at Oak Creek Terrace recently.  From the moment we checked in the staff was really helpful, Heidi was AMAZING in making sure we had everyting we needed.  She even noticed a problem that wasn't their problem, and offered a solution for it without my saying a single word!  She went above and beyond every time she came into contact with us.  The TV's and Internet were having issues when we checked in (because of a storm that knocked out the power) and, while not convienent for a bride to be out of internet planning the final details, they stayed on top of fixing it and gave suggestions to help me accomplish what I needed to while it was being fixed.  The area is beautiful, and the rooms are all a little bit different which is nice for those looking for options and price variations.  We checked out knowing we'd be back!",,,,"['twice', 'first', 'time', 'laws', 'cabin', 'cabin', 'cute', 'frame', 'story', 'cabin', 'secluded', 'others', 'set', 'back', 'property', 'beautiful', 'view',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-views-inn-sedona,The Views Inn,4.0,$,41,"Great place, good deal, good breakfast, nice rooms, quiet area in the heart of a magnificently majestic place, staff were nice too.Pros:- good location (Big Park, AZ), closer to many hiking trails if you compare it to hotels in Sedona (about 8 miles from Sedona)- clean- across the street from a small shopping center- many items to chose from at breakfast- big rooms with fridge, microwave, efficient and clean heaters- compared to hotels of the same caliber in Sedona, quite cheapCons:- had a bit of a problem with room service (found strange hairs in freshly changed towels and 2 days out of 5 room service thought we didn't deserve shampoo and conditioner). It is true, the first day I didn't leave a tip since I usually leave a larger sum at the end of my rather long stay. The next day, seeing that I didn't get shampoo, I started leaving tips and the shampoo reappeared as by miracle. I would have left a larger tip if it weren't for this ""now you see it, now you don't"" game.- I would have preferred to keep my towels and reuse them but they do not offer this eco-conscious/money-saving option here.  - very spotty to no WiFi reception- if you come to this area for shopping and not for hiking/nature, Big Park is considered a ""commuter-city"" by some, therefore may prove not cool enough for the more urban/glamorous types ;-)Great bed!! Good for a one night stay. Breakfast could have been better but does the job.We extended our stay because of the comfort and great value.-friendly owners.-super clean rooms and facility.-great breakfast and outdoor dining area, relaxing.-convenient and clean laundry room.-large rooms with nice linens and furnishings.-comfortable  matress.-quiet atmosphere.-beautiful views.-within walking distance to the village cafes and shops.- directly across the street from the visitor's center.Recommendations-move smoking area. It is the centerpoint of the property and nonsmokers have to pass it to get to the front office and all amenities. I also smelled it while using the pool.-open the pool at 6:30 am so guests can swim before breakfast. 9:00 am is late for those planning a day of activities or travel. We will return the next time we visit Sedona!Staff was very friendly and accommodating for our early morning arrival. Rooms are very clean,  well appointed. We stayed for 2 days and they were greeting us by our names as we would return to the room to freshen up. I'd recommend this hotel to other's that don't need the appointments that a resort offers.Nice quiet hotel. Everything in the area (food-wise) closes at 9pm - so be prepared. We arrived early and our room was ready (clearly seen through window) and they wouldn't let us check in. Quiet irritating and they watch you like a hawk to make sure you don't go in. The hot tub closes at nine and the owner is out there monitoring the entire time - creepyRooms are clean comfy and modern - free wi-fi is a plus!All in all a good place to stay for a quick trip or if you're over 60I decided to go on a last minute mini vacation for the night and so I was looking for a descent hotel for an affordable rate and I saw the Views Inn online. The pictures looked ok so I decided to just book the room. The lady at the front desk was extremely helpful and generous; she stayed a few minutes past her shift in order for me to get checked in. (Since I arrived shortly after office hours). The room was clean, nice and had a great view. The breakfast isn't too fancy - no pancakes and waffles but it's enough to get you through the morning. For the great price you pay you can't expect to have a fully cooked meal in the morning.Got a king sized room on 2nd floor with red rocks view.  The room was very nice and updated.  The bed was comfortable and had plenty of pillows.  Having a fridge and micro was great too. Hotel is within walking distance to several restaurants and fast food places. Also next to a gas station and outlet mall.  The free breakfast was nice. Had fruit,  hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, cereal,  OJ, coffee, yogurt,  toast, and bagels. We would stay here again for sure!Beautiful views, easy access to parking, the pool and hot tub, restaurants &amp; gas station are short walking distance.   Very friendly staff!   Clean property and rooms.  Highly recommend for the price!Nice economical motel for Sedona. PROS: -Clean and cheap-Located next to an outlet mall however the only good store there was the Gap.-There's a small pool and jacuzzi area-Laundry room available with free detergent-Free breakfast available, though the choices are limited. Stock up on the apples and free OJ (found in the fridge where the yogurt is!)Recommend having dinner at Cucina Rustica which is very close by and a wonderful restaurant.Actually I mean 4.5.                               Pros-- Clean modern rooms. Microwave, frige, coffee pot. Desk people very nice and accommodating. Decent (not great) views. Basic simple breakfast choices, cereal, bagel, hard boiled ceggs etc. Near good reasonable prices food choices. (see Pagos) Bed ok. Shower ok.                   Cons-- heater a little noisy.                  Basically a good choice when going to pricey Sedona.I stayed here for 3 days. Great price, very clean, updated rooms. I was actually not expecting the rooms to be this nice. Very nice considering this is a budget property. The breakfast is ok, hardboiled eggs, coffee, yogurt,cereal, juice,Coffee, pastry,bagels and toast. Everyone is very nice. I will definitely stay here again.So here's my thing with the Views Inn:  First, the room I booked included a ""mountain view."" That's a feature included in their website description, as well as my confirmation.  What would be a reasonable expectation for a room that had ""mountain view"" included as a feature in its description?  Our view was of the Arizona Tourist Information Center across the street.  That's it.  To be fair, the room itself was as advertised.  Just nothing I would call a view.  Knock off a star.The continental breakfast was okay; the cinnamon ""rolls"" were about the size of a quarter.  Knock off another two stars for the way we were treated by the proprietor, in a dispute over a certain insect we found on the floor.  It blew up in a hurry.  My wife was called a liar.  No one calls a guest a liar, even if they are one.  The room discount we were offered disappeared and so did we, never to return.They call it ""The Views"" for an obvious reason,When you look out the window your eyes you'll be pleasin'.Comfortable and clean in a cute neighborhood,I wish I could move in and stay here for good.I recommend waking up before 7am to see the sunset. You will look out the window and lose your marbles. The bright red rocks will be screaming at you as the sun peeks over the horizon and lights them up. Then head to breakfast, where the coffee is hot and the cinnamon rolls are OFF DA CHAYNNNNN. The beds are firm and very comfortable. Very cool southern decor in the rooms. They give you full-sized bars of soap and high quality soap and shampoo. You can tell the owners really take pride in their mom 'n pop hotel.We were able to walk to the Red Rock Cafe for lunch, to the gift shop, to Circle K for a coffee, and to the Full Moon Saloon for a beer at night. Prime location, Prime hotel. Stay here. You can't beat the price for what you get.Hands down, the best deal in Sedona.  Super clean, great staff and the price can't be beat! The breath taking views, OMG!Yay for The Views Inn! It's everything we were looking for in an economical hotel. Friendly desk staff, clean room, quiet, comfortable bed and deep tub. It has a jacuzzi to soak your sore muscles after hiking the red rocks all day. It's away from the swarm of tourists that are in Sedona proper and close to fine eateries and a great coffee shop. If your just looking for a nice clean place to rest after a long day of hiking this is a great place.Here's the skinny. While this hotel is clean, local to Sedona (7 miles out), and touts amenities like free Wi-Fi, a free continental breakfast, and views of the Red Rocks of Sedona, it is all a cover for poor hospitality service and hidden fees.I booked the room with Expedia for four nights, three weeks in advance. I read the online fine print about additional charges, etc. and called the hotel to find what these fees, charges, and surcharges would be. When the woman answered on the end of the phone and I confirmed my reservation I asked about it. Her words: ""You have prepaid, so you're all set."" She seemed in a hurry to get me off of the phone, so I took her word and left it at that. Big Mistake. We arrived around 9:30 p.m., and because we knew the desk would be closing soon, we rushed to the desk to check in. The woman confirmed that the booking was prepaid, and then asked for my ID and card used to pay for the booking to confirm (standard procedure at most hotels, so I did not blink). When I gave her both, she tried to authorize the debit card. When I asked her why, she stated that there was a $75.00 deposit required in order to book the room. Without this deposit she could not allow us to check in.When I said that we were first of all not informed about this deposit, and second, that we were not prepared to pay it, she flatly said that we would not be checked in. We had to deal with this behavior after driving for 10 hours straight--we were both dead tired. I asked if I could speak to a manager. She said that the manager would not be in until morning. When I asked the manager's name, she refused to give it; her entire manner was very abrupt. My husband just paid the deposit in cash, and we checked into the room. But the entire affair left a bad taste in our mouths. This was only the beginning.The breakfast was anything BUT Continental. Little cinnamon rolls that they bought from the local grocery store; tiny, GREEN apples; boiled eggs; pre-packaged bagels and bread; and packaged cold cereals and oatmeals. I felt gypped, which so far was becoming par for the course with this place.Free Wi-Fi: A day after I patched in, I started receiving suspicious emails that matched some internet searches I had done the day before, so I immediately stopped using it. I always carry my own mobile hotspot, so I was not at a loss--but this only increased the bad taste that started upon check-in.I asked another clerk when I could speak to a manager, and she said he would be in shortly, then asked for my room number, which I gave. She explained that the manager would knock on our door when he arrived. I asked her for the manager's name, and she told me it was Danny. We went back to the room, and stayed for at least another hour and a half after this with no no visit from the manager. We had to leave, as we had a paid tour to attend in Sedona. When we returned to the room later that night, there was not even a phone call. Crappy, crappy customer service.The next night I found an item of clothing missing from my room. We always take any valuables with us, then conscientiously repack our clothes in the suitcases. So for an item that I was sure I had packed in my suitcase to come up missing was very strange. This was after 9:00 p.m., and I encountered the same brusque, uncooperative night clerk we had dealt with on check-in. She said that obviously the maid had gone home for the day (duh), and she would leave a note for the maid in the morning.The next day we actually ran into Danny, who acted as though he did not want to be bothered, then motioned to me to walk to the lobby area. I calmly stated that not having policies written down on paper was not fair to the customer, nor was it fair that I had called ahead to get answers on extra surcharges, and had been told that everything was fine. Danny obviously did not like me, and did not like criticism, because he became hostile, and started talking to me like I was stupid. He then tried to pass it off to Expedia. When I let him know that I spoke with Expedia and they said that any additional policies were the policies of the booking hotel, he became even more hostile, and told me that I must think I'm a queen who deserves special treatment. That this is the hospitality business, and I am only a customer, not a queen. Then he had the unmitigated gall to accuse me of being the one who was hostile, said I was nothing but a problem, and that my issues with him must be with his skin color.Then he threatened to call the police. I told him to go right ahead. He then backed down, but said in so many words that he wanted me to check out. I told him I would NOT check out unless he refunded me IN CASH the last night of my stay and the $75.00 deposit given to them for ""incidentals"".His desire to get rid of me was more pronounced than his desire to be right, and after the room was checked, he refunded both. No one should have to go through this, and I am still appalled.Great location. The rooms are surprisingly nice and clean. Isabelle was friendly and very accommodating. I would definitely stay here again.This place is good and cheap. Sedona is so expensive and this place is a money saver. The rooms are clean, there's tv and free wifi. (How much more could we ask for? Lol) the bathroom is really small and the beds are a bit uncomfortable though. On the plus side, they serve a decent breakfast from 7 am- 9:30 am. We will definitely stay again when we come back to Sedona!I really loved my stay here! I had a king size bed with spa jet room, also had a mini view of the red rocks which were beautiful. Good price for the location! The staff was very courteous and assisting! They also had brand new furniture arriving the day I was checking out!","Hotel room is clean &amp; very nice for the $85 price. Comes with a fridge, microwave, iron &amp; full size ironing board. Hairdryer, nice TV &amp; free wifi (which we haven't had any problems with). Pool, spa &amp; pretty good views. It doesn't smell &amp; is a nice size room. Bed is a little hard for my taste but my kids think they're fine. We will stay here again!Man behind the front desk was also very nice!Location was perfect, great views and near the Bell Rock pathway trailhead. The owner and staff were friendly and accommodating.  The price was very reasonable and with the clean rooms, pool, spa, free wifi and continental breakfast I really felt I got a great value.  We booked three rooms on the ground floor  for a mountain biking trip so we could keep the bikes in the room.  You can hear people walking upstairs so get a second floor room if you'd prefer to be the stomper instead of the stompee, but it wasn't bad at all. This will be ""my place"" if we make it back next year. Hot tip, the bar at the golf course up the highway has reasonable food and drinks too.This place was awesome for the price. Just a bare bones motel, but it was very clean (not something I always expect from a small motel, so that was a nice surprice) and just a short drive from downtown Sedona. I would definitely come back here.If you just need a bed while you're out exploring Arizona, I would recommend this place.Stayed here as it is in the village of oak creek and near verde valley school where I was attending an event. Room was clean with fridge and tv. Free wifi. Not the fanciest place but it did the job. Continental breakfast was extremely minimal. Staff was friendly. I would stay here again if I found a good rate on Hotwire. I did not swim in the pool but it was very small. The hotel was also very close to the Bell Rock trailhead.My friend and I love to visit Sedona and although our trips there are usually day trips, we decided to spend the night this time around, especially since we were going hiking though Red Rock country. Since we were traveling on a limited budget, we decided to book a room at The Views Inn. It turned out to be a good choice: the staff was friendly and helpful, the room was spacious and really clean, and the large beds really comfortable. It's just a few miles outside of Sedona proper, so it was convenient as well. And the name is appropriate; there are great views of the famed red rock formations of Sedona from the inn. A really good deal for the money.We stayed here only one night when we were in Sedona for hiking.  It was a very pleasant surprise because it was so clean, fresh and in my opinion, perfect for a one or two night stay.  The rooms are large, the bed comfy,and  the bathroom fresh as if it were just redone. Our room was very clean and tastefully, yet simply decorated.The people who worked there were  helpful and friendly. Our friend left his gps in the room after we checked out and they called us to let us know, I was impressed with that! They had a breakfast of apples, eggs, hard boiled eggs, toast, yogurt and mini cinnamon rolls. It's in walking distance to little shops and restaurants.  I'm giving this a five star as compared with other hotel/motels in this price range. (I would compare this with a nice Hampton.) I highly recommend staying here if you're going hiking for the weekend. It's not a resort as you probably already can tell.  But great place.This hotel saved the day for me.  After weeks of efforts to block off rooms for my wedding at other hotels I got in touch with the Views Inn.  They were very helpful in getting me everything I needed at  a great price The rooms were nice and the views breathtaking...ok maybe that's a bit of a stretch but definitely impressive.The breakfast options on the other hand not so much, but luckily they were within walking distance of subway and I didn't really book them for their breakfast anyway.Clean room, friendly staff, great price and incredible location.  So happy that I stayed here.  Will definitely recommend to anyone who is heading to Sedona and is on a budget.For the price The Views Inn is not a bad deal there were just a few parts of my experience there that caused me to give the inn only two stars.First of all they don't have fitted sheets for their king sized beds so our sheets were constantly coming off during the night and exposing the mattress.  The people at the front desk are not very friendly and when my girlfriend called to ask some questions the front desk attendant hung up on her before even allowing her to ask another question.The swimming pool was dirty and had lots of trash in it.Finally, during each of the mornings of our stay there was at least a few breakfast items that ran out which was a disappointment.The price was right but there were too many inconsistencies for this motel to receive a good rating from me.I have good news and bad news about The Views Inn. First the good news. The rooms are very clean. The beds are new and comfortable. The prices are reasonable for the Sedona area. The staff was helpful and courteous. Now the bad news. Our room smelled like insecticide. The smell is overwhelming when you first enter the room. The breakfast is a miserable collection of itty bitty pasteries, yogurt, fruit and waterery coffee. The wifi goes down ever ten minutes or so. Wait a minute, it will come back up.Not sure I'll be back.me and my wife stayed here . we got a ground level room with a king size bed. and it was great and it is right in the middle of the town. very close to all the hiking trails that we wanted to go on. great service at the front desk and the room was nice and clean, i will be back to this place in the future and it was cheap . we booked it about 10 days before our trip to sedona and it wa under 100 bucks.Excellent all around.  Comfortable, clean, well-located.  Staff very helpful.  I would definetly stay here again and would recommend The Views Inn.I gave the views inn 5 stars. My wife and I come to sedona often to take care of family affairs. Denny has gone out of his way to accommodate us every time we come and is very professional. The rooms are clean &amp; the price is very reasonable. Located close to hiking trails and other activities. Need a place to dine or having car problems, Denny can give you a referral. My overall experience was excellent. I continue to come to Sedona &amp; stay at the Views Inn. I would highly recommend the Views Inn. Denny and his staff are very professional, they make us feel like family.$79 on a saturday isn't bad at all. The pic looks just like our room did, although the bedding was slightly different. Mini Fridge and Microwave in room. Plenty of brochures in the lobby, breakfast items avail in morning, although we skipped it and went to a bakery down the road...that's a separate review for sure.Place is clean, newly refurbed - they are doing the pool area now. So, that'll be great by summer.Views are good. Walls are thin - it is, after all an old motel. So, come sun up - you will hear everything as people get up and start to load their cars, shower, perform bedroom aerobics, etc.But, it IS out of the construction zone of Sedona - and the traffic mess that is causing right now. I liked it. I'd give it 3.75 stars for sure.I stayed here back in 2009.  It wasn't anything great but was clean.  This year I was pleasantly surprised with the minor upgrades.  Great staff and super clean rooms!  This is a great location - gas station across the street &amp; eateries within walking distance.  I will definitely be back :o)My husband and I stayed in one of the king rooms at the Views Inn for a wedding we were attending in Sedona. We were very pleased with our stay! From our arrival they were very accommodating, we got in early and were extremely tired and they made sure we were able to get a room, even though they were still cleaning the rooms from earlier departures, which made everything so much easier for us! The rooms were very spacious, comfortable and clean. They have a microwave, minifridge and large TV in the rooms, as well as nice fixtures, so its very comfortable. The only 2 issues I had with the room is the shower was very small and the sheets would not stay on our bed (I have no idea what kind of linens they used, but they refused to stay tucked in, so we woke up on the mattress each morning, bummer) but other than that, everything was very nice, actually more than I expected. They have free wifi, the pool was smaller but extremely well kept and clean, well stocked with plently of chairs and towels. The morning breakfast was fine, a variety of continental items, bagels, toast, fresh fruit, coffee, etc. The location is great, very close to everything, and within walking distance to several restaurants as well as the tourist information center. The back area of the hotel looks out to the redrocks so its very pretty, but I wouldn't say that every room has a view, ours looked at the parking lot, but we didn't really mind. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, my only complaint there is that they literally called us at 11:02 the morning we were scheduled to checkout (checkout it at 11:00), so I sort of felt like they were watching us making sure we leaved immediately, but I know they probably were just trying to get the rooms clean for the next stay, still, a little annoying. We would definitely stay here again if every back in the area and would recommend it!Nice room and close to man part of town without being in the chaos. Only complaint is owners (or maids, or both?) children seem to play all over. In the parking lot (2-ish year old ran out in front of my car and almost got hit-no parent in sight) and the others (at least 3-4?) seem to run around screaming most of the time-all hours of day and evening. It was not that big of a deal but when we just wanted to relax in our room and had to listen to kids screaming, it should not be the maid or owners kids doing the screaming at least!This is a no-frills hotel but it's spotless, well maintained, the room (2queen beds) is comfortable and has a fridge and microwave.  It's outside Sedona about 5 miles or so but easy to get there.  I did hear two women complain that they had the same view but one had been charged extra by Expedia for a room with a view.  They were asking the manager for refund but I don't know how that turned out.  Don't pay extra for a view--who spends enough time in a hotel room to worry about that?  Especially here where the views everywhere outside are so awesome!Stayed here for our first time to Sedona. Keep in mind, that this inn is NOT near thedowntown Sedona area, but about 5 miles from it. However, the rooms are clean, and the staff is nice. Not luxurious, but fit the bill for us for 3 days. The best part of the area is Desert Flour, the bakery/restaurant across the street, where you can use your breakfast coupon.....delicious!We stayed at this motel only one night, but I was very favorably impressed.  It's actually in Oak Creek Village, which is a few miles outside of the traffic mess of Sedona proper; but as the name indicates, it has fabulous views of the local ""red rocks"", from just about every room.The room was big, the place was clean, clean, CLEAN, and the owners/managers were friendly and helpful.  We had to leave very early to catch a plane, so we didn't get to try the brekky, but the fixings were all there.Check the Sedona Chamber of Commerce website for specials... it cost us only $60 before tax, on the ""Chamber Hot Deal"" (Sept. 2009).Oh.. a bonus...  ""Maria's"", about a block away, is a very good Mexican restaurant.  Quite different from what you might find in NY.  Just avoid the carnitas, unless you like them dry.  Large portions, generous drinks, and decent prices.","Very affordable, clean, great views, friendly service.  We paid $84 a night (with tax) for the 3 of us (a room with 2 queen beds).  There was light breakfasty stuff in the morning, a printer and computer to use in the lobby, a pool, and stunning views.  This isn't ""The W"", but in this price range, absolutely wonderful.",,,"['great', 'place', 'good', 'deal', 'good', 'breakfast', 'nice', 'rooms', 'quiet', 'area', 'heart', 'magnificently', 'majestic',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/wildflower-inn-sedona,Wildflower Inn,3.5,$$,44,"Stayed here with my dad on a father/daughter weekend trip. Our destination was really Jerome but we couldn't find a room in Jerome that appealed to our relatively simple tastes as well as our budget. We found the Wild Flower via Trip Advisor on a Google search. Great rate... I don't know the rack rate so I won't post what our cost was.Rooms are recently renovated (last couple of years) with great consideration as to what really makes the difference... New bedding and solid surface counter tops. Clean with basic necessities plus a few bonuses.. Flat screen TVs, free wifi, continental breakfast (including a waffle maker), awesome veiw! The beds are very firm (which I love). Front desk staff was so friendly... Shannon checked us in and gave us a great recomendtion for dinner (Chinese... The Red Chopsticks right behind the hotel - check out my review there). The morning clerk was just as helpful. I drink A LOT of (tap) water. I carry a 32oz cup and fill it with ice and water about 6 times a day. They had a pitcher of water but I asked her to fill it at the source so I didn't leave her pitcher empty. She apologized that all they had available was tap water (which is what I prefer) and was happy to help. No doubt I'll be staying again. Perhaps next time with my BF for a more romantic trip to Sedona!We stayed at the Wildflower Inn in the Village of Oak Creek 15 or so years ago---I think it was brand-new, then. We don't remember details, except being pleased.  But now my son lives just around the corner, albeit in an apt so small it's tough to have company, so we made a reservation at Wildflower.  Still pleased.  The room was clean-clean-clean!  And you can tell it was recently refurbished.  Nothing super-fancy-schmancy---but I think the guy from Hotel Impossible would be impressed.  (And frankly, with some of the greatest hiking on earth a stone's throw away, how much time are you hanging in the room?) Furnishings modern and unbattered, linens fresh and white, carpet and draperies well-swept and unstained.  (Thank you, Rosa, the housekeeper!)  Only ""decor"" was a nice photo/painting of the Red Rocks---but really, can you compete with what's right outside the window?  Amenities included microwave, mini-fridge, coffeemaker, and even a basket with complimentary water and popcorn.  Staff very pleasant.  And excellent views of Cathedral, Courthouse, and Bell.  My son works at one of the 5-star resorts in Sedona, and he was impressed by the attention to detail and service.  If you want to stay outside of the craziness of Sedona and aren't looking for a total ""resort"" experience, this place is highly recommended!Note: This is a great location for hikers.  You are within a five minute walk of the trailheads of Bell Rock, Slim Shady, Made in the Shade, Courthouse Rock, Cathedral...On a spur of the moment trip to Sedona, we took a chance and stopped at Wildflower Inn, as they were close to where we wanted to hike the next morning. Friendly, accommodating staff, clean rooms, continental breakfast, and did I mention clean and friendly?!My boyfriend and I decided to take a last minute trip to Sedona. I am sure finding a hotel while in Sedona would normally not be difficult as there are so many however, as we were being spontaneous, we didn't stop to think that it was Easter weekend! We had missed attending a 'sports car road trip' the prior weekend, so as goofy as it sounds, we loaded up with both cars. We arrived in the later part of the evening and as we both called hotels, realized we may be spending the night in our cars!! Finally I reached a very friendly voice, connected to a man by the name of ""Jack"" at this location, 'Wildflower Inn'. Jack was VERY friendly and stated he had ONE room left and had saved it for this exact reason! (Someone coming into town who had no room) I immediately was over-joyed stating we wanted the room, and jokingly asked if I could get him anything and believe I offered beef jerky and or soda! Lol. Needless to say Jack laughed and stated that wasn't necessary and our credit card information would suffice.The location of the hotel really is great as it is just on the edge of this side of town and though the night we arrived we did not notice, the next morning we could see we had quite a wonderful view of the beautiful red rocks surrounding us!! The parking lot is a little small which did lead us to having an issue with having a spot to park once we returned from finding something for dinner that evening. Jack fixed our problems! The next morning, we explained our parking problem the previous night as well as the phone ringing at late hours (they were having issues with their phone system which we were unaware of) so Without hesitation, Jack gave us a discount for a future stay. We decided to stay another night and use the discount and enjoyed it just as much with no issue! In short, though the parking lot is small and may be over crowded on a holiday weekend, they will make accommodations as Jack explained we could have parked my car in the empty handicapped spot and they wouldn't have towed it under those special circumstances. They do offer a breakfast in the morning, though we didn't partake so I cannot say much about that other than its there. The rooms were BEAUTIFUL, well kept and very clean!! As far as pricing, you get what you pay for here!! Sedona tends to be a bit pricy however, we found that the amount we paid was well worth the comfort and friendly nature of the staff!! We will most definitely stay at this location again should we find ourselves in Sedona!! We enjoyed talking with Jack so much that the morning we went to share our parking issue, we spoke with him for over an hour!!! He really made our trip fun as he is full of life and laughter!!! And yes, I left a bag of beef jerky for him when we left as well as a note thanking him! Naturally I did this to be funny as we had joked about my excitement and silly offer!!The views are fantastic but the beds are super hard and uncomfortable.  The bathroom had no fan. Some rooms,  our first one had no fridge. Gas fireplace didn't work.  Absolutely no early check-in, 45 mins early and they said no. Some in room strobe light went off all night, maybe a motion sensor.This place was great. Large room, king size bed and it was at a reasonable price. Will definitely go here again!This was our first visit to Sedona.  We planned to drive through on our way home from the Grand Canyon.  Unfortunately, Bell Rock Vortex had other plans for us and we decided we NEEDED to stay the night and venture longer.  Wildflower Inn is literally down the road from Bell Rock on the 179S at the Bell Rock roundabout.  We decided if the price was right we would stay there.  The receptionist (forgot her name) was knowledgeable.  Jack (assistant manger) was very knowledgeable and gave us hiking as well as restaurant recommendations.  I requested a room facing Bell Rock and chose #107 (2nd floor was sold out).  It was a handicap room with a king bed.  It was large enough to also include a double sleeper love seat, coffee table, desk, mini fridge, microwave, and large upholstered bench.  The bathroom was large with a regular seat, hair dryer, and coffee maker.  The water pressure was good.  The WIFI was free and fast.  The price also included a free continental breakfast with fresh waffles that you make yourself.PROS: Views, location, great customer service, free breakfast, free WIFI, microwave, mini fridge, mini dryerCONS: Towels smelled of bleach/chemical, decor was datedRECOMMENDATIONS:  Give staff raises :)my wife and i stayed for a night for a sedona getaway. great place, very clean, great view from our room.Pros- nice staff and very helpful. Good price and an excellent view of Bell Rock. Terrific location.Cons- the beds are so hard I think I'd rather be sleeping on Bell Rock. The internet connection is equally bad. Great place if you love hard beds and do not want internet.I am trying to sleep on this bed and cannot fall asleep even though I am tired, so I decided to write this review.We stopped in here last night on our trip back East. Found a great rate online and booked the reservation. Within 10 minutes the clerk at the hotel called to check with us and give us any information we needed to get into our room. Very friendly. The room was great! Very clean with a fireplace, free WiFi, and a view that can't be beat! One thing that was a huge plus with me was the shower! Traveling across the country we've found it hard to find a place with good water pressure; no problem here! I loved the toiletries offered too; they smelled good and didn't feel ""cheap"". In the morning we stopped in for a continental breakfast. They had waffles, bagels, bread and apples with juice and coffee. Was a good start to the day. Overall a good experience here and I'd return if we ever come through Sedona again!First i want to say Jack at the front desk was awesome! Best customer service i have experienced in a long time. Next, you have to understand this is a 2 star budget hotel, this isn't the Fairmont or any other luxury brand so you can't compare it to a hotel like that. The beds were nice, rooms were clean. For a cheap Clean hotel in Sedona, this works. Free continental breakfast, waffles,coffee and bagels. The only thing i didn't like was the smell of the room, which smelled like old lady perfume, and made my clothes i had on smell like that. Im assuming it's the cleaning products or deodorizer they use to clean the room..so, if they read this, i would recommend changing that. Otherwise all good, especially if you are on a budget.BED BUGS!! I stayed here in October 2012 and brought 1 bed bug home with me. The bites showed up 2 days after staying here and I immediately packed up all my clothes and called the exterminator. He literally only found one bed bug in my house, but we found about a dozen eggs underneath the second bed (which we just threw away). It was two weeks of hell. We called the motel and they said that their staff is trained to always look for bed bugs and defended that they didn't have bed bugs, but they refunded our money--which makes me think they knew. I wasn't going to post but I just drove by (shiver) and decided to see their reviews on yelp and saw someone else experienced bed bugs here too.Great service! Accomodating owner. Clean tidy rooms. Phenomenal views. Stay here!!! We had issues without Expedia booking so we called the hotel directly and he matched our lower price. They are courteous extremely helpful and overall great customer service. The red rocks are right in your face too and you can walk to restaurants nearby. Love this place!Two words... Bed bugs. Room 207.  Checked out immediately.  Told front desk and they relocated us to a sister property (which was great!!!) I can't make this stuff up.  Check under the bed skirt at night and use your phone as a flash light.  Boom!!! There they were.  Nasty little blood sucking creepy crawlers.  I'll have to wash all my clothes before the suitcase comes into my home.  Sedona was off the charts beautiful.  Pick a different hotel.We check in November 28th2015. Room is clean and front desk guy so kind. Most good point is walking distance from Bell Rock and nice view. We really enjoyed our staying and will be back next our visit.We booked the Wildflower Inn through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a> and the rates were very reasonable.  This inn is nothing fancy so don't expect too much other than clean beds.  The check-in and check-out processes were very quick which was much appreciated and the desk clerk was very friendly.  The room we booked had two double queen beds and it was smaller than the pictures we saw online but who are we kidding, aren't they always a bit deceiving?? The room has just enough space for two beds, a rocking type chair, a dresser, a little walking space, and a bathroom.  At first I wasn't too fond of the sink being in the same room as the beds rather than being in the bathroom, but it did end up coming in handy.  One person was able to use the shower while someone else could start getting ready outside with the sink.  I read some reviews where people were unsatisfied with the beds but I didn't have any issues.  The beds were comfortable enough but the pillows weren't that great.  They lacked fluffiness and were kinda sad.  There were some stains on the floor which I wasn't sure what they were so I wore socks most of the time I was in the room.  The bathroom was clean and no complaints.  The shower had plenty of hot water and the water pressure was strong.  Overall the room is nothing to write home about; it is a little depressing when you first walk in but it somehow grows on you.  The room included continental breakfast which didn't have too much but they did have bagels, fruit, waffles, coffee, juice, etc.  No eggs, sausage, bacon type of breakfast but for the price of the room I'd say it's a steal that they even include breakfast.What was so great about Wildflower Inn aside from the reasonable prices was the location.  The views immediately outside were amazing; you could see Bell Rock and other rock formations.  The Inn was also in a prime location since you can walk to go hiking or drive like 15 minutes (which we did because we wanted to hike at Cathedral Rock).  There are plenty of places to eat that are nearby.  I highly suggest eating at Red Rock Cafe and getting coffee at Firecreek.  Overall I would suggest booking Wildflower Inn if you need somewhere cheap to stay in Sedona and want a clean bed.  The room will not impress you but the views will and that alone was good enough for me!This was our second time staying here, and yes, we are fans.It's not the most luxurious of places, but the price is super nice and we got a room with a freaking hot tub in it.  Holler!  Their front desk folks are very nice and have lots of knowledge (as well they should) about the surrounding area and things to do/places to eat.  Speaking of eats, they have a decent little complimentary brekky, better than your average continental crap (not just mealy red apples and bruised up bananas), they have bagels and juice and coffee and milk and WAFFLES!!!! Maybe I'm just a sucker for waffles, but hello!  Not some janky Eggo business, no no, they have the real deal peeps.  Anyway, to the room.  The king sized bed was nice, not too hard and not too soft.  There's a mini fridge and a flat screen tv, although we didn't really use either.  The bathroom is kind of generic, but they offered organic shampoo, conditioner and body soap.  We really loved the hot tub, so relaxing and cozy after a long day.  If you're not too picky about all the glitz, I would definitely recommend this hotel for your next trip to Sedona!Mediocre. On the second floor we have one heck of a view of Bell Rock. The room is decorated nicely. The beds are very firm. The water pressure in the shower head was very low. The fan in the bath room was very loud and turned on when you turned on the light. It was annoying when i got up in the middle of the night and will most likely wake up who ever you are staying with. The air conditioning worked well and there was a gas powered fireplace. The tv had lots of channels. There was also a mini fridge and microwave in the room.Wow, What an incredible view of the red rocks from the viewing deck!!!This is a cute little hotel in a premium spot, short drive from downtown. They apparently have recently upgraded the rooms, and I loved the neat look with modern furniture, the molding on the celing, the absolutely immaculate housekeeping details.... I can go on and on. The staff was friendly and super helpful with finding local joints to eat and with all local trails and attractions. Made our stay memorable!I would recommend this hotel with no reservations and I am definitely coming back!!This place is located 6 miles from the hustle and bustle of downtown.  It is right on hwy 179.  The scenery is amazing from the top deck.They need to do some updates to the bathroom.  The ceiling was moldy and the floors didn't seem the cleanest.The front desk people weren't the most helpful but that is ok.Breakfast was average.   But there is a cafe across the street and a circle K if you get the munchies and need some nachos!","I stayed two nights at the Wildflower Inn recently and really enjoyed my stay. It's cost effective and the staff is very friendly. Another perk is that Bell Rock Trail is close by so you can literally walk out your door and go for a hike. Another perk of staying here is the continental breakfast. They offer bagels, fruit, waffles, coffee, juice and milk. The waffles are the real deal, too. No frozen Eggos here!A big bonus: free wi-if! Just ask the manager for the password and you're good to go!The Inn is also within walking distance of some great shopping areas and restaurants. I'll definitely be back!Clean rooms, firm beds, has burning fireplace in room, great view of the red rocks. Weak water pressure and the hot water takes a little to heat up. Great stay for 1-2 nights, wouldn't stay longer. Breakfast consisted of waffles, bagels, toast, coffee and juice; wish there would have been a bit more variety and/or something more filling.The Wildflower Inn is just OK but then again you get what you pay for.  To make this review quick:Pros and Cons (depending on your point of view and how this is written):No fan in the bathroom (steamy but quiet)Weak Wi-fi (Enjoy the outdoors and hang out by the lobby area)Very efficient air conditioner (loud white noise but kept the wine cool)Refrigerator in room (was planning to go to Circle K but a car drove through their window that night)Room is clean and no surprises here (WHEW!)We did ask for extra towels and were happily supplied.  The front desk person was helpful and pleasant.  Everything was clean and in good order.  Didn't enjoy the breakfast as we left early that morning for a tour.  Bottom Line:  It's your basic 2 star motel that is clean and the rooms are not dingy.  You're there for the night and hopefully not a romantic get-away!We stayed for one night on the 2nd floor, beautiful view, room was cleaned. Room has mini fridge, no microwave, but one in lobby, a rockin chair and flat screen tv. Also on 2nd floor was a nice viewing deck with chairs to relax and enjoy the view. B-fast was good in small area, 1 waffle maker, bagels, fruit, coffee and juices. Price was $150 total for 2 queens, usually would not pay that price, for the type of hotel, but labor day weekend and a great last minute getaway.Made a reservation online 1.5 weeks in advance, but canceled over the phone  the next day. I get a call on the day of my canceled reservation asking if I was still coming  . I explained I had canceled over a week before and not to charge my card. They did anyway.We got here at 8:30 pm after driving two hours from Grand Canyon. Very friendly front desk lady. It's a very compact room with two queen beds. Clean overall and I love they offered free WiFi. Competitive price if book through online travel website. Nice mountains/rocks view!!This is a good hotel to pick if you're looking for something simple, clean and cheap.  Because Sedona is a very small town, this place is not that close to their ""downtown"" area, however is close enough to their outlets!  They have some nice views of the Red Rocks, a mediocre continental breakfast (bagels and waffles), and nice customer service.  Nothing special or fancy, although at the same time, nothing gross nor a horrible experience.Very clean..  Friendly.  Up to date.  Nice breakfast of make your own waffles, fresh bagels, fresh butter, cream cheese, OJ, apple juice, fresh fruit, good coffee.  Great pizza place nearby.  I'd give a five if not by noisy freeway and had pool.  Great view!We check in June 17th and Check out 19th.We have a spacious room, a King size bed, and a nice Jacuzzi.  All these for 79.99! We enjoyed our stay in the place.Early morning we almost lock ourselves because the deadbolt wasn't working that time. Make sure this doesn't happen when front desk is only available 7am to 10pm. Their emergency phone number is in a busy mode when we made that emergency call.I was getting married on 10-10-10 in Sedona, and since I knew it would be busy I tried to getting rooms blocked off well in advance.  This location seemed ideal at the time so I called to ask about blocking some rooms.After weeks of calling and being told I needed to speak with the manager who was never there, being promised he'd call, we would get a discounted rate and rooms reserved I finally got in touch with this person who refused to block off any rooms unless I paid in full up front for each room.  Not only was I disappointed that I was now weeks behind in finding rooms, but the person I spoke to was extremely rude and practically accused me of lying.  Luckily The Views Inn was able to hook me up with the rooms and a discount! :)The Wildflower Inn...Ok yelpers. My Fiancee is an avid user of groupon, living social, deal chicken and the like. We got a stay at this hotel along with a wine tasting at a nearby local vineyard (the winery was a completely different experience and is in it's own review).  We paid for their jacuzzi suite and a wine tasting. We got a wine tasting and a key to a dirty jacuzzi suite. I'm talking windows open, lights on in the room, bed un-made, wet towels on the floor. The front desk clerk said the maids must not have serviced the room that morning and the hotel was full but that he could put us in an out-of-service room which they just had the carpet cleaned. Having no where else to go, it had to make do. Floors were wet and I had a very unhappy girl for the rest of the night (she was really looking forward to using the jacuzzi).Because we got the room through groupon they would not give us a refund for the whirlpool suite which we paid for. We instead received a free stay certificate, with the catch that it expired in 3 months and could not be used for any holidays. While I live in Phoenix and my fiancee in Tucson, needless to say we were not going to be able to use the certificate even if we would. I loved Sedona it's such a beautiful place, but the next time I go I'll be staying somewhere else.Pros:Nice locationBell Rock ViewsJacuzzi TubAffordableFree breakfastFridge in RoomPlasma TVConsNo sheer curtains so you have to use dark curtains all day unless you don't mind curious humans.Front door opens directly to the parking lot.Chair looks like it belongs to Archie Bunker.Rough dirty carpet.Bizarre Green stains at bottom of jacuzzi. Creepy looking light fixture that hangs from the ceiling.Possessed Air Conditioner that keeps you up all night.Bathroom light when turned on sounds like an jet engine.The carpet is probably softer than the sheets.Lumpy pillows.Hollow bed.This pretty much sums up why we just gave up and are now back on the road at 11:45pm to head home to Phoenix. Couldn't sleep. Office was closed. Lovely.  I guess we won't be enjoying the free breakfast.This cute little roadside motel is just that. A roadside motel. It's not the hilton or the marriot so don't expect it to be. The front desk staff checked us in and told us about the free breakfast in the AM. then we went into our room and it was clean. Had a great king bed. Our bed was firm so maybe all of the past gripes about the bed issue prompted them to buy new. We took in the view of the mountain and then shut our curtains for privacy which was ok because we only stayed in the room long enough to get ready to go out exploring and have some dinner. Not sure who comes to Sedona to sit in their room and gaze at the view but we went there to go out on the town and go hiking. The most time we spent in the room was after dinner and it was just fine for us.Only 2 small issues, we did have a few spiders crawling around, which is to be expected on a ground floor unit. And I forgot my toothbrush and even though there was a sign stating to ask if we forgot those types of items the front desk didn't have any. Other than that it was exactly as expected...it as an inexpensive roadside motel with clean sheets and a nice plasma screen TV. The tub in the room wasn't really a big draw for us because my boyfriend is 6' tall and he really couldn't fit in the tub but it was funny watching him test it out lolSo pleased we found hotel out of Sedona, great location for hiking. Hotel was clean, rooms comfortable and very quiet. Our room had a jacuzzi bath in room. Breakfast was included, just coffee, juice and donuts but keeps you going.Staff very helpful. Would certainly stay there again.I'm basing my rating on the fact that this is a roadside motel. For the price, this is a tremendous value. My room was most importantly, super clean, and secondly, actually quite spacious. It has a comfy loveseat, flat screen, mini fridge. The lady at the front desk was very informative and friendly. A real budget find.Great value and the manager was really nice and helpful at check-in.  Pay the extra $10 and you get a sweet view of Bell Rock.  Better view here than at the Hilton!!! For $120 less/ night!  Rooms are clean and seem recently updated with comfy beds.  What more do ya need?Well, I am re-entering my April review since I see it was removed...and NOT by me. The room, at best was so-so. We did not have WiFi when we first checked in, until I asked the front desk clerk, who was nice, to tweak the connection in an adjacent room until we got it. We had booked the room through a travel service at $135.92 for 2 nights and it was paid and on our credit card bill long when we checked in. Then when we checked out, the desk lady said there were no incidentals and off we went. When we checked our credit card bill, they billed us again $203.17! When I called Wildflower, they said they'd investigate &amp; credit us back. When I checked my credit card statement a couple of days later, I saw ANOTHER bill for $203.17! That's $406.34 for a room I had already paid for long before we even got there. I got my credit card company involved and some two weeks later, including a talk with the owner, I was credited back the $406.34 and all was good.  The owner said for my troubles, he'd give me a $50 discount on my next stay with a Choice Hotel. I asked him to put it in writing. I have YET to see it but hmmm, my review had somehow been deleted. My suggestion to you all is: drive right past this place and stay elsewhere!pretty happy with my choice to stay at the wildflower. but for the price, it's a little farther out from sedona's ""city center"" (hence the loss of a star). but all in all, really nice place. very nice breakfast, nice rooms, free wifi, and great location to bell rock. i hiked bell rock and courthouse butte the morning of my departure from sedona and the owner let me leave my car in the parking lot so i didn't have to buy a parking pass at the trailhead (it's about a 5 min walk to the trailhead). the views are beautiful and it's only a 15-20 min ride into town. if you can get closer, maybe try but this place is very comfortable and clean.Alright, this place has the roadside motel layout where you can park right next to your door (which is a bad thing in my book), but it has a few things going for it. There's a jacuzzi in the rooms, with a plasma screen TV that can be angled toward the tub. It's also right across the street from the Bell Rock trailhead. But don't look at the picture of the pool on their website and assume they have one. You just can get access to the Hilton pool down the road, which doesn't cut it.However, I'll remember this place mostly for the noisy air conditioner, which kept us up all night and we later realized was far far noisier than the neighboring units, and the lobby clerk saying ""Oh, I'll have Maintenance take a look at it"", which is decidedly not the appropriate response for a couple that was already in the process of checking out.After a long day of activities in Sedona, this was a great place to stay! Right off 179A. The things that made this hotel great included,: Amazing rock views, comfortable beds, friendly front desk staff, nice contintental breakfast and a spacious room. We will come back!","We reserved the room from the local tv stations special deal, king size bed and jacuzzi.  When we took a shower the water didn't go down and we were standing in ankle deep water (gross); and the knobs on the jacuzzi were broken!  The view from the deck upstairs was very nice, but the patio cushions were torn and very worn! The front staff was friendly, but only there from 7am until 10pm! The hand soaps were great, smelled wonderful!  Overall not a bad place considering it is not a large chain and doesn't charge resort fees.  I would try them again.Great roadside motel. Simple, clean, friendly staff, free wifi, handy fridge, very comfy king sized bed. The jacuzzi tub was a bit small...maybe you could have crammed 2 adults but we didn't try.  It was relaxing after hiking though. We didn't have a view from the room--it just looked out at the parking lot. We'd stay here again.While the layout of the hotel is similar to a roadside motel, the rooms are very clean, updated, plama screen and all!  Fireplace, nice bedding and furniture.  Overall, a great deal.  It is about a 10 minute drive from Uptown Sedona so be ready to drive.  The hotel does have great views of Bell Rock.  Staff was friendly.So my second time around.... I booked this a little less than 24 hours so it's my fault I didn't get many options. It was decently priced and that's because I said I had AAA. I did get one of the best prices though. This place was newer. Note: You either get the room with jacuzzi or the fireplace. So if you care about that, then make sure you request either or.  It's at least 15 minutes! to Sedona downtown! I'm sorry but that was too far for me. I did like the fact that it's close to one of the vortices. View was alright.  I would stay there again but I'll check for another place first. Continental breakfast was cool that you could make your own waffles! Front desk needs to be a little bit more professional. They seem a little too young to be able to handle customer service. I overheard a couple checking out with a little complaint and front desk did not even address anything. You get what you pay for or less.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/baby-quail-inn-sedona,Baby Quail Inn,4.5,$$,43,"This review is long overdue.  Stayed here on a whim, passing through town about 2 years ago.  Found the place on an app, while looking for a lower priced option.  Adorable spot, walking distance to shops &amp; restaurants.  Room was cute, quaint and clean.  Owners were very friendly, welcoming &amp; attentive.   Fast forward 2 years, during conversation with a work colleague from Sedona, we discover the owners are long time family friends of hers.  Small world.  HGreat little place to stay. I booked a queen room for 1 night. This is a cozy little place to spend a weekend. It's on a residential street, and is quite for the most part. The room was a bit smaller then expected, and I believe the bed was a full, not a queen as booked. The appearance of the room was clean and well maintained. If I were to be spending multiple nights, I would have liked a larger room, but a 1 night stay was fine. The hot tub was not very hot, luke warm actually. It was not enjoyable. The whole property is non smoking, including the parking lot.Awesome awesome awesome. Why stay at a chain, when you can indulge in a lovely experience at a boutique type hotel?Dick and Misty (the owners) are very personable and involved. They have lived a heck of a life and definitely know how to accommodate. I will return and would highly recommend this place. Excellent location and ownership.Beware. Even though I only made my reservation two days ago for a November stay Misty the owner still charged a 10% cancelation fee. That's 10% of our entire stay!. We were so looking forward to our visit but due to circumstances beyond our control we had to cancel.What could the 10% possibly be for? Just a money grab. Definitely will not be staying there on our next visit.Cute little hidden place on a quiet residential street. Very close to grocery stores and shopping. Very clean and tidy rooms. I slept great in the super comfortable bed and was pleased that the bathroom was so big with a big shower and lots of counter space! Pretty little yard and owners were so cute and sweet.  Very enjoyable stay!Very quaint little B&amp;B in a quiet area. Rooms are small but they are clean. Two waffle pattern white bathrobes are in the rooms which is nice for the hot tub. Boyfriend and I wanted a little getaway for Thanksgiving weekend. checked in on thanksgiving afternoon and the person at he desk, James, was very pleasant and helpful. We needed to move our dinner reservations to an hour later and James offered to call the restaurant for us. He was able to change he reservations for us which was very nice. We didn't feel like having takeout dinner in our room. The hot tub closes too early (9 pm tonight) in my opinion but maybe it is early because of the holiday. The office has classic old VHS movies you can watch in the rooms. OK, OK so the Tube tv and VCR in the room is a little crusty and from the 90s but I am paying to get away a few days, not to sit on my duff and watch HD TV.Only complaint is the room we stayed in seemed like you could hear everything. There was a man in the next room who talked so loudly two mornings in a row I thought he was in the same room. Maybe he just is a loud talker but dang at 6am!?! The hotel is owned by Dick Curtis and he was there the morning we checked out. He was telling a story about Desi Arnaz to a group of people when I picked up some fruit in the lobby. When I checked out he autographed a glossy pic he gave me, nice man. They don't serve a cooked breakfast FYI- it is just yogurt, fresh fruit, muffins, coffee and tea. Overall I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet getaway.I booked a room at the Baby Quail for the same night on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a>. <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a> messed up my reservations and the lady in the front office that works in the AM made a call and fixed everything. She is awesome. The motel is right off the main hway on a residential street. Very quiet though. The parking lot is very small.The grounds are immaculate. Its a small 2 story building with about 12 rooms. Reminds me more of a bed and breakfast then a motel/hotel.When we went to check in around 4pm, nobody was at the front desk. A maid that didnt seem to speak english, walked in and out looking at us but not saying anything. Finally after the maid walked in a third time we told her we need to check in. She went and found the evening front desk lady. The front desk lady finally came into the office. Not friendly and said sorry i was fixing something for another guest. And immediately asked our name. She quickly gave us a key. We had to ask her where the room was located and a few other things. She wasnt friendly.The room was small but very clean. I mean REALLY clean and organized. They really made an effort to remember the small things and the finishing touches. The room had 2 robes, luggage rack, soft and firm pillows, fan, window a/c, large bathroom and shower, little coffee pot, iron, mini fridge and small flat screen tv with cable. The queen bed was very hard and uncomfortable and you sink to the middle of the bed. Not good when 2 are trying to sleep. The room we were in was downstairs, room 3. We heard the older people above us the whole time. They must of had a hard bed too because they were up all night walking and moving around. They were not loud. I believe its just an old building and you can hear everything downstairs. So we didnt get a good sleep.But the grounds were very quiet and beautiful. Very relaxing and lush with trees, bushes, and plants. They have a hot tub and fountain in the courtyard along with some lounge chairs and tables.I dont smoke, but if you do, this place isnt for you.  No smoking in rooms or anywhere on the property. If you do, your card will be charged 300.00. They have it written in the checkin paperwork.Also they do not allow pets.They offer a small breakfast bar in the am from 8am to 11am.Dry cereal, oatmeal, fruit, yogert, muffins, oj tea hot chocolate and coffee. Nothing fancy but it fills the hole until lunchtime.The owner, was a hollywood actor who played bit parks in movies. He is 87 now and hangs out in the breakfast room waiting for the guests to come in.Once he sees you, he asks where you are from and then starts to tell you about his life in film. He tells everyone the same story word by word. He has the walls of the breakfast room plastered with photos of himself and he enjoys telling you about them all.He then will try to sell you a 20.00 book about himself.He stands around in the breakfast room waiting for the next guest to tell the same memorized story to while watching you eat.After a terrible night sleep, i really wasnt into being forced into hearing about someones life story.But others may enjoy that kind of thing. When we left, the owner gave me a signed autograph. PROS: The room was cheaper and cleaner than your basic economy motel in the area. And the grounds were beautiful and immaculate. Big bathroom and shower. Quick check out.CONS: Terribly hard bed, Small room, No pets allowed, Owners forced song and dance first thing in the am. Lots of rules printed, posted and verbally noted.My hubby and I came here on our first visit to Sedona for 3 nights.  Based on reviews, I booked this spot 'cause, you know, we're on a budget and it seemed like it was a good deal considering how expensive things get around here.  We loved it!  Friendly staff, VHS tapes, good location (we walked to many restaurants to get food and drinks and it's a short drive to downtown) and a nice outdoor area to relax in.  We even locked ourselves out of our room at 9:30 PM and one of the owners graciously and effortlessly drove over and gave us another key, all smiles.  It's also very close to Red Rock State Park, Soldiers Pass Trail, Cresent Moon/Red Rock Crossing, and others.If you're looking for a clean place to rest your head after a long day of hiking and exploring, this is the place.  Grab a VHS and some wine and enjoy!We loved this place. It was VERY quiet. We loved all the chairs in the cool garden area. The hot tub was a GODSEND after the Jeep tour. Breakfast was simple but filling. The owners were pleasant and helpful. Yes the rooms are not huge but who spends a ton of time in your room in Sedona? They were clean and comfy and great to come back to. We will definiately be back. If you have a choice between chain type hotels and this place you are missing out if you don't check it out!I recently moved across the country so my friend and I decided to make a cross-country road trip out of it. We were at the Grand Canyon when we realized that all hotels between there and Zion, our expected next day adventure, were booked. I was totally bummed, but fate took over and we rather accidentally ended up in Sedona. Thanks to the great energy, amazing views, thrilling mountain drive, and the Baby Quail Inn, it ended up being our favorite part of the whole trip!I think other raters summed this place up very well: it's cozy; owned by a couple, the gentleman who was a Hollywood actor in the 60s, and whose adorable Bichon comes to hang out during the day; there's a nice hottub with beautiful views of the night sky; the bathrooms are very large; the whole place is very clean; free breakfast and VHS tapes (love it!); and most importantly, it's all extremely affordable! I could go on and on about this place, but I think you get the point. Just stay here, you won't regret it (unless, of course, you prefer to stay in stuffy places like the Ritz).Great little inn. The office staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. You must meet the owner, Dick Curtis, His stories are pretty impressive. Rooms are a good size, very clean. Would recommend this place highly for a great stay in sedona.Went to Sedona with my boyfriend for a quick trip and last minute decided to stay the night. The innkeeper was super nice and welcoming and our room was comfortable and clean. The continental breakfast in the morning was supplemented by Dick Curtis and his tales of his days in show business. Overall wonderful.Nice looking small inn tucked a short distance off the main street which keeps the road noise almost none existent. Small breakfast in the morning but had enough to satisfy our hunger. Great selection of classic VHS movies to play in your room. The neighbouring rooms had good soundproofing however the rooms on the second floor did not, could hear the people above us walking around all night very clearly. Good location to a number of restaurants.What a great place! First impression when we got here was the property is very nicely maintained and surrounded by pine trees for a very private feeling. Lots of outdoor furnishings with a cozy hot tub. Check -in was fast and easy. Our room was very nice. It appears to be newly remodeled because the paint on walls was very clean, the rug is very clean with no signs of wear and the bathroom has clean up to date tile. The bed was extremly comfortable (very soft just the way we like it) with quality linens. There were extra pillows and blanket in the closet which was thoughtful and appreciated as my husband and I always sleep with 2 pillows each and I with extra blankets. There were even robes in the closet. The room has a table with 2 chairs, a microwave, mini fridge, and a coffee maker in the bathroom. The bathroom was very roomy with a large shower; there probably was once a tub in its place based on its size. The room itself is not large but totally adequate. In the morning we had the continental breakfast which had more than expected; cinnamon rolls, large muffins, cereal, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit, orange juice and coffee. The owners and employees are very polite and friendly. The room rate was very affordable in comparison to other available lodging. We will certainly stay here again in the future.My friend and I stayed here after a day of hiking in Sedona and we had plans to leave very early the next morning. The Baby Quail Inn was PERFECT for this reason. It's a small inn owned by an older couple. They are extremely nice and they provide continental breakfast each morning. Upon check-in we we're greet by a very nice older woman and I am ashamed to say I do not know her name. She informed us of their no smoking policy which is AWESOME and that they also have VHS tapes that we can rent and bring back to our room for no charge. Nice little perk! She also gave us a yummy cookie. This was my first encounter of how they pay attention to personal detail. Our room smelled and looked clean, and was cool upon walking in, not musty like a lot of hotel rooms I have been in before. There was a red washcloth in the bathroom with a tag that instructed us that it was to wipe out shoes with. How perfect since mine were covered in the red dust of Sedona from hiking all day! Again, personal detail and a nice touch. There were also your basic amenities except there were also makeup removing wipes! Again, more detail :)The room had a mini fridge, microwave, tv, VCR, coffee machine and coffee supplies also. Extra pillows and a blanket were also in the closet. Overall, I recommend this inn if you need a nice, quiet, clean, and functional place to say. It served it's purpose for us and I would definitely stay here again!We loved coming to this Inn. It is tucked away, so it's easy to miss when you drive by but it keeps things pretty quiet. The staff was nice, and everything was really clean. We will definitely be staying here next time we go to Sedona. Make sure that you stay for breakfast here and meet one of the owners, Dick Curtis.My boyfriend and I had a really great experience here. Dick Curtis is very hospitable and the rooms were clean. The price point was great. It's also not very far from up town. We enjoyed this small quote property. It was tucked away in a little neighborhood. We will definitely stay there again.Was drawn to this Inn only for the price, and it was a great decision to stay here. The owner's and staff were friendly and the room was very clean. A great place to stay in Sedona!Really enjoyed this place!  Dick Curtis is a hoot. You can find him in the breakfast room every morning (telling the same stories). The rooms are clean, basic rooms. It's right across the street from a Whole Foods and the microwave and refrigerator are a nice touch, as are the complementary robes. Rooms are ample and clean. the whole place has a very homey feel.A great little hidden gem of a place!  Stayed here last weekend and had a wonderful time.  The owners are very nice and I enjoyed talking to them the morning we checked out.  They've got a breakfast and the coffee was very tasty.The price is definitely nice and the rooms and grounds are clean and well taken care of.  The only bad thing was that we attempted to sit outside and talk and apparently we were being too loud.  I think that because the place is so small, the noise travels.....so we moved!  No harm, no foul.  But it is a tiny place.Location is great and I loved the idea of being able to borrow VHS tapes to watch in the room.Suggestions:  Post somewhere what time the office will be closing, so that you don't miss out on getting a video.  And, offer guests the password to login for the Wi-Fi.Other than that, awesome stay!  Clean, comfortable and great location!","Searching for a place to stay as a solo traveler to Sedona, AZ, this place is a bargain. While staying in Sedona, you don't spend much time in your hotel room, but rather enjoying to sights! Stay at Baby Quail Inn if you're searching for economy priced accommodations with friendly service, extremely clean rooms and free breakfast! I'd recommend this place without reservations! I had a very pleasant stay, and would return again. Thank you!This place is fantastic! Very clean and extremely friendly staff. It's super affordable and within walking distance of a lot of great Sedona restaurants as well as Oak Creek Brewery. It's got a hot tub out front as well. The breakfast isn't much, just beverages, fruit and pastries. This was my first time staying here and I'll definitely stay here next time I'm in Sedona.This place is awesome. It has so much character. Yes, it is more of a motel, but the price is unbelievable for the location and for Sedona. Our beds were comfortable and for an older place, it was quiet. We were even on the first floor corner room and still weren't bothered by people walking by. The man who runs it is awesome. He is 86 and a retired actor. I would love to hear all of his stories, but for ease, he has a wall set up with all his memorabilia so you can glance while you eat the continental bfast. They have a nice hot tub and on saturday morning, there is an art show right through the parking lot. We walked to eat and to the art show- location was awesome. I am going to stay here every time I come to Sedona!I will keep it simple with a list of pros and consProsClose to allQuiet areaNice ownersHelpful info about areaConsVHS player and micro TV (VHS, really?)Needs longer jacuzzi hoursShower/bath combo made for oompa loompasRooms are kind of cramped for two peopleDon't expect a continental breakfastThe price a little high for what it is. I wouldn't say it was horrible, because you really shouldnt expect much, but I wish it could have been a bit better. I would choose somewhere else if I chose to visit Sedona again.I felt like i was staying at my grandparents house for the weekend.  You will enjoy breakfast whether you eat or not.  I will always recommend anyone to stay there!!!We stayed at the Baby Quail for three nights last week; two nights in room #4 (downstairs) and one night in room #5 (upstairs). The price is right, no doubt, and the rooms and bathrooms are clean and functional enough. Still, I would have preferred to pay a little more for a slightly better experience. The king bed in room #4 is lumpy, but much softer/better than the extremely hard, sloping queen mattress in room #5, which left me with two days of back pain. If you're downstairs you can hear people walking above you, but it's not terrible--I'd take the better mattress. Temperature control in both rooms was difficult--it was mostly too hot. On our last night, a Saturday, there was a loud party going on somewhere nearby. We couldn't figure out if it was a house party on Willow or maybe noise coming from Olde Sedona, but it was so bad I eventually called the police at around 2AM. The owners are sweet and helpful. Hearing the ""60 years in 60 seconds"" history of Dick's career--followed by the long version and then book pitch--wasn't really my thing at the crack of dawn, but I probably would have been more game if I'd gotten a wink of sleep the night before!We decided to stay here based on the price and reviews, and I'm glad we did; this place was great! We originally booked 2 nights, but ended up staying 4 nights because we loved Sedona so much! Our room was very nice with a big bathroom. The only downside was that the bed sagged quite a bit in the middle, but we slept well despite that, and the body shop next door was a bit noisy at times. The staff was great; they offered great advice on restaurants and hiking trails. Overall an awesome place, highly recommended!Absolutely perfect experience. Room was completely clean, complimentary robes, etc. Breakfast was outstanding, and Mr. Curtis is extremely friendly and attentive. I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Sedona on a budget.The gf and I stayed here after the drive from San Diego.  It was perfect. Super homey and they had a hot tub. Clean and toasty. Rooms are basic but with everything you need and great bathrooms. Met the owners in the morning and had a blast talking with them. The place is walking distance to the Red Planet Diner, one of my favorite little guilty pleasures when in Sedona. All in all, a great place with cool peeps you want to support.  Really good price too. Do it.We were happy to find this cute place, off a main road yet tucked away from it all. We stayed here for two nights in December, just before Christmas.After reading what others had written, we got a room on the second floor and had no complaints with noise. Pros:- Getting to meet Dick Curtis &amp; have him explain the collages of his performance life on the walls of the breakfast room- Very pleasant, helpful service- Large bathrooms- VHS tapes to borrow (we actually enjoyed this and watched The Thin Man &amp; On Golden Pond)- Fridge &amp; microwave in the room- Jacuzzi with a view of the trees and the stars - although it was in the 30s, we put on our complimentary bathrobes over our swimsuits and took a nice dip here-Complimentary breakfast-A reasonable amount of outlets for electronic appliances- Across the street from New Frontiers Natural Marketplace (kind like a whole foods - you can pick up sandwiches etc. from their deli)- Good locationCons:-Breakfast is simple: oatmeal packets, pre-packaged pastries, fruit, coffee, tea-My husband thought the bed was old and uncomfortable-Price is a little high, but seems to be a decent deal by Sedona standardsI loved this little place! First, the family who owns it is so nice and helpful. They have breakfast such as yogurt, fruit and cereals in the morning, and what's even better is they have some classic VHS videos if you find yourself hanging in for the night! It's a mile away from the main strip of shopping, so easy access to everything. This is not some fancy hotel, so don't expect it to be. If you're a little quirky and like things a little less mainstream, this is the place to be! Enjoy!Given that this was a last minute booking in the middle of December,  we were pleased with our choice to stay here. I got my booking done through expedia and thankfully got to the motel before their closing time which is around 7 I believe. So call this make sure you're not late. We were greeted that evening by a very pleasant young lady. She helped us by answering questions on what to do, see and eat that night. The room was decently sized and clean. We didn't get cold that night either. The next morning we got to traipse up the airport mesa for a gorgeous sunrise. At breakfast we were fortunate enough to meet the owner. He is a famous film star from the 60's by the name of Dick Curtis. Great man! Overall we enjoyed our stay.It's great for the price. It has all your basic needs and it's super clean. Cozy and peaceful.We made reservations for Thursday, but had to postpone at 3pm the day of. We counted on eating the money, but called and they allowed us to reschedule with no problem. Unusual, but appreciated. We arrived on thanksgiving day at 4pm. There was an envelope taped to the office door with our name on it. My wife said that was the most painless check in she ever experienced. The room was small and the bathroom was huge. Seemed like a waste really. The place was immaculate and cozy with charming decor. The grounds look neat with several patio sets throughout. We stayed ok the second floor (rooms 5-8 I think). Not much of a view (for Sedona), next time I thinly we will opt for the lower level.Solid 4! This place is pretty simple, but personally I really like it that way. It's in a great location, near all the action, yet somehow manages to keep a pretty quiet and serene atmosphere. The zen-like lounging area and hot tub helps a lot!The room was a decent size, nothing huge, but had plenty of room for two even with all our hiking gear. Everything was incredibly clean. The bed's a good size too. I wouldn't have complained if the mattress itself were a little softer, but neither of us had any trouble sleeping. There are plenty of extra pillows, too!The bathroom is super cute, and had every amenity I wanted (blow dryer, shampoo/lotion set, towels). Most importantly, the water pressure in the shower was pretty good. Showers without good water pressure are always a fear of mine in new hotels, so I was relieved when this one felt just fine.Other perks? Complimentary breakfast, free wifi, the service was great and we had a fridge and microwave, which is actually really good for restaurant leftovers. For the price, I think you'd have trouble finding something that compares. Definitely will return!Nice people and great price for the area.  Comfy beds to sleep because the town closes at 9. Big bathroom and very clean.This place would have been MUCH better with a new mattress and later hot tub hours. We stayed in that same room as the photos and you can clearly see how awful that bed is. I wished I had slept on the floor.one other thing... this town dies after 8pm. Everyone here is afraid of vampires.They seem to take pride in being ""Pet Free"". Not for animal and wildlife lovers.Stayed here last weekend for a quick getaway with the bf and was very happy we did.  While the room was on the smaller size it had everything we needed, was decorated wonderfully and very clean.  It is walking distance or a short drive to everything and because it it not right in the middle of the action it is quiet and peaceful place.  I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Curtis in the morning and his stories, smile and genuine warmth made my day.  A great place that I would stay at again.Loved staying here! Comfortable rooms with huge bathrooms, very friendly staff, hot tub open late at night, and generous continental breakfast.","I stayed here for 5 nights and was very pleased. We had a nice sized room with a great bathroom. The bed wasn't as bad as other commenters say!! The owner of the inn is super friendly and very kind. A real treat to talk to. And I enjoyed that it's on the west end of town on a quiet street. When I go back to Sedona, I will be staying here!!Very warm and clean Inn in the heart of Sedona. Off the main street so the night is pretty much noiseless. This Inn has two floors with about 18 rooms, a heated jacuzzi outside, and a BBQ area. We stayed in a room with a king size for about $50 a night (it was early February). The rooms have your usual- a coffee maker, TV, microwave, table, mini-fridge etc. Mattress could have been a bit better as the middle kind of sank. Overall, nice experience. Wouldn't mind staying here again!The Baby Quail Inn was quiet, quaint, and located on the quieter side of Sedona. The room was spacious and the bathroom was great! Free breakfast in the morning as well.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/super-8-sedona-motel-sedona,Super 8 Sedona Motel,3.5,$$,46,"Hotel prices in Sedona are on the higher side so and this was more on our buget for our family of 4. We only needed comfy beds and a clean bathroom since our plan was to eat out and spend all day at slide rock. This hotel is about a 3-5 minute drive from old town which was perfect because it was really busy when we went (cowboy day...which was actually all weekend). There are plenty of dining options, grocery stores,  a few churches near by and a circle k across the street for late night snacks. Friendly staff, clean and quiet grounds, decent breakfast and nice size pool for relaxing. My only negative side to the review isn't a deal breaker for next time. Bring your own swimming towels from home. The ones they provide are fit for a 2yr old. Also, pay attention to the bed description. They are DOUBLE'S. Comfy but smaller than most. There was no way my husband and I could peacefully sleep together so we each shared a bed with one of our boys . To me that was a plus since it's no longer cool to sleep with mom. :)We would stay there again and recommend it to others.My husband and I booked a room here on our most recent trip to Sedona, and had a pleasant stay. The room was only $83 for the night (Thanks Groupon!), and included free parking, free Wi-Fi, and free breakfast from 6:30 to 9:30 AM. The breakfast buffet was a solid spread of oatmeal, waffles, cereal, yogurt, and hard-boiled eggs. Our room was clean, and had a mini fridge and coffee maker. The location is great! The hotel is close to a Safeway, Starbucks, gas station, and several local eateries. The front desk staff was accommodating, and we were able to check-in early and check-out late at no extra charge. This is a dog friendly hotel, with ample space to walk your dog in the grassy area outside. There is a $25 pet fee, which covers two dogs. My only complaint is that the shampoo dispenser was empty in the shower. We would definitely stay here again!Awful! First things first we planned on traveling with our pets we called in advance to see if this hotel was pet friendly the woman I spoke to said yes and there was a designated dog area.!Great so we get there and we get informed pets are not allowed to be in the rooms unattended! Are you joking me we only booked this room since it was pet friendly, the designated dog area is not even fenced! The air conditioning did not work at all!!! Horrible.. The maids were super sweet though!Excellent location, really nice room, noisy, but a great deal with lovely views in beautiful Sedona (especially if you get a groupon like we did). Pros:- Surprisingly nice room with a large comfy bed, a mini fridge, a giant TV, a comfy chair and a work desk - the room is definitely more hotel than motel.  - The breakfast area is large and has lots of seating, but we never made it during serving time to see the selection. Cons:- The hallways of rooms are definitely the seediest aspect of this place, but they do have a key-card lock on the doors to get into them.- It's Super noisy - dogs barking, kids yelling, cars, etc.  My husband and I didn't mind a bit, but in case you do, it's important to know.We stayed here this past weekend and found this ""budget"" brand to be quite nice.  Sedona rates are a bit higher x summer x weekend making this not so budget.  It was still a decent rate considering; and I got a last minute same day reservation..  It's right on one of the main drags through town and close to some restaurants and shops.  The front desk personnel were polite, and accommodating.  They offered discounts through several programs unsolicited and I was able to get 10% off.  The grounds and the rooms were clean.  The pool was functional and packed.  We didn't use that but it looked very well kept.  It was pretty warm but the air worked perfectly (you'd be surprised at how many places don't).  The bathroom was clean and had updated fixtures.  Beds, linens, towels, and room were all clean and pretty well kept.  A little bit dated, and small; but there was a tiny fridge and pod coffee pot.  They serve continental breakfast with a little dining area too.I was pleasantly surprised and would stay here again!This room is very decent for the price. It includes a fridge, coffee maker, a 32"" LCD TV, a closet unit, secured free WiFi (very slow), and a blow dryer for the ladies and some fellas out there! The area where this hotel is situated is very clean with great views. The only negative I've found thus far will be the lack of power coming from the shower. It's a pretty weak stream but it does get very hot.This will probably be my go to spot whenever I'm in Sedona, AZ.Obviously there are posh options in Sedona. If you're looking for an affordable way to visit the Red Rocks, then this is a nice option. We opted for two double beds, which isn't a huge room but it doesn't feel cramped with the additional furniture. The TV is large if you're going to do any watching while you're there. There's stowage places for your gear so it's not right in the middle of the floor. The fridge is a decent size, too. Our view from the window on the back side of the hotel looked out over houses and into the rocks. Pretty excellent for a Super 8.The sheets are not heavy and the blanket at the bottom is more like a table runner, so if you get cold or visit during the cooler seasons you may want to ask for additional cover.The pool is a little small if there's a bunch of people enjoying the water, but the pool area and seating is clean and access to the pool requires a room key.I got this room at a good rate with <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FPriceline.com&amp;s=a7fbdccf674e97746685dfb19eddf988696e5a62d38c815fc567f952b1c07748"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Priceline.com</a>. Later I called and ask if I could stay for a second night and they gave it to me at the same good rate. $25 one time pet fee for the entire stay. A continental breakfast had the basics, nothing good. Coffee was ok. The people are great, polite and the maintenance guy I called to fix the he TV (which he did quickly) got all my jokes. I think this place was awesome for the price!The hiking trails are all within walking distance..., lol!Pros: - affordable price- very clean- comfortable- close to alot of restaurants and main streets- continental breakfastCons:- thin walls so you can hear people talking outside in the hallways- there were no thick blankets in the rooms (I guess you can always ask the front desk for some). Would I stay here again? Most definitely.I was very impressed with this hotel!  I usually stay at Hilton or Hyatt properties, but had free nights here from business travels.  I was a litle worried, as Super 8 is not usually very nice. But this place has been redone recently and was clean, comfy beds.  Nice front desk lady.  Pool was clean.Only negatives: no protein on the breakfast at all.  No eggs, yogurt, nothing.  All carbs.  Also the air worked awesome.  But it was loud.  I'm a heavy sleeper, so it didnt bother me, but hubby said it bothered him.The room layout and bed was good.  Bed was firm and clean.  The place is dated but does not smell like a old motel.  Good cheap place to stay for 1 night.  Breakfast was BAD.  No quality selection and food was cold.  The biggest issue was the AC unit and mechanical noise.  VERY noisy and ongoing all night.  I suggest paying a little more for a lodge across the airport that is 100% better.As a person who likes to travel on budget hotels with good quality this was one of them! (4.5 stars really) Purchased as a groupon and was only under about $90, although it will be changing its name from super 8 to another name soon. The views around the area are breath taking and the front desk was kind enough to give us a map of the city and told us scenic places to visit. Also breakfast has a pretty good selection with the staff always accommodating if certain items are out. From waffles, yogurt, bananas, oatmeal, cereal, cinnamon roll bags, toast to the drinks coffee, orange juice, apple juice, and even HOT COCOA! (Yum!)I travel allot for work and usually avoid the super 8. Nothing fancy but the rooms were clean and updated. Decent pool and facilities. If this was a Hilton I would have given it only 2 stars. This was above average for a super 8, thats why I gave it 4 stars.Yep, a very inexpensive place to crash, but honestly the room was very clean.  Rooms are a bit thin walled, so not the quietest of places.  The guy at the counter (Nick?) was super friendly and helpful.  There is a Circle K directly across the street and in the other direction (still just across the street) about 1 light away there is a pretty nice Safeway.Horrible room and service!!!  Our room was leaking, and I mean full-on shower leaking!  Front desk could care less and said too bad!  Grrrrrr!Great room for a great price! We were here for the weekend for a wedding and got this deal last minute through Priceline. All the hotels in the area were $175+ per night and we came up under $120! I was skeptical about staying in a ""2 star"" hotel but we had a great experience overall. The room was clean and had a brand new updated bathroom. There was a large flat screen TV, which was better quality than our relatives staying at the Orchards Inn. The beds were comfortable, there was a coffee machine, microwave, and fridge as well as hair dryer in the bathroom. The hotel is clearly older, there are stucco ceilings and plaster walls with limited electrical outlets. The walls are thin and you can hear muffled noise in the room next door as well as housekeeping in the hallways. Also, a lot of light comes in under the door and thru the window, despite the curtains, but we are heavy sleepers and didn't mind too much. Best part was the fact we were on the third floor and had an amazing view of the mountains!If you have dogs and want a mountain view room, they will not tell you until after you book your room. Then they will upgrade your room to a downstairs room at the back of the motel with views of the parking lot.This place is horrible!!!! Got a room on the 3rd floor and all we heard was the fan in the roof all night. The place had a really bad odor in the common areas and the rooms also. After my first night of no sleep I had to fight to get my money back for our second night. The breakfast was horrible. The police woke us up at 2:30 am looking for someone. I will never stay at a crappy 8 ever again!!!!!This is probably lowest price hotel around that area. Its every convenience and close by following-Cafe restaurant front hotel - show room key and get 15% off-Circle K gas station - across street - walking distance-Barking Frog Grille Restaurant - across street next to Circle K-Crescent Moon Ranch at Red Crossing - Cathedral Rock Trail - 5 to 7 mins drive-Devil Bridge Trail - 5 mins drive-Main Street on Sedona - 5 mins driveService is okay-Front desk is very helpful with question like hiking trial -Hiking trail map is available on front desk - just ask for it-Breakfast is okay. Waffle, Bread, Pasties in bag, banana, cereal, yogurt, coffee, milk, orange &amp; apple juice   There are lady there to clean and stock up whatever is low.. if you like her service there are tip jar on counterRooms-3 Floors-Clean, neat and new-mini fridge-TV-free wifiI used hotwire and used their secret deal and got Super 8 in Sedona. I was a little nervous since it was a motel and wasn't sure how nice it would be. It was a good location, the room was pretty nice and clean and they had free breakfast. If I go back to Sedona I would stay here again.","This Super 8 location is truly a gem.  You'll easily find yourself paying much more elsewhere for the value you'll get here.  Kudos to the Management of this location for attention to detail placed on all key aspects of the hotel experience.  Rooms are clean, stocked with high-quality linens, towels and modern furnishings. The same can be said about the bathroom.  Other nice features are pet-friendly rooms, fully functional Wifi and a flat screen Tv.  Basically, the rooms do not at all seem like something you'd expect at a Super8- by this I mean the rooms are nicer than what you'd think.  I've now visited this location for two consecutive years during the Thanksgiving holiday and am convinced this is one of the better deals in town at under $100/night.I will never again stay at this fleabag hotel first of all our toilet ran all night and I brought it to the managers attention and they said they would fix it they didn't my husband had to go to the restroom the next day and the toilet got clogged and they blamed us really,  there is other places to stay in Sedona that are much better quality spend the money because I wish I would've spent the extra $50 and got a triple a rating instead this place.. I should've paid attention to the reviews before the manager the front desk and everybody else all the other minions that work there do not care it's all about money to them . I will be sending a letter to their corporate office but again I doubt that helps if you go read super eight complaint department it's really bad. And then general manager Anthony what a joke . He just sent me an email blaming my husband again for the toilet being clogged, accusing me of trying to get a discount all I did was ask do they except AAA discount obviously they don't you have to be a triple a hotel to offer that avoid at all cost there's so many other places to stay in SedonaGood location, clean rooms, nice and helpful staff and good priced!!! Free breakfast in the morning is always a plus too!!!We stayed here in the begging of January 2014 and I am beyond impressed!!! The price is more than perfect and the rooms are very clean. The staff is also super friendly. I didn't have a problem with customer service, we even decided to stay a few extra nights and they were great at accommodating for us. If you're visiting Sedona on a budget then this is the perfect place to stay. It's super close to Uptown and there's a ton of nearby hiking trails. They even have a grill and picnic area for hotel use. The free breakfast is pretty basic but it's free so I wasn't expecting much. They have cereal, coffee, cinnamon rolls, juice, fruit, yogurt, oatmeal and waffles. Sorry if this was too long but I like to be detailed because that's what I look for in other reviews.the front desk was super nice guy i believe his name was phillip or joseph. he knows the area well and his recommendations were spot on. he helped us w hiking and p;laces to eat. we came with no plans or schedule so it was perfect. also our standard two bed room was definitely way better than the budget room idea. it was newly renovated clean and smelled great. nothing was like we thought. it was wayyyy wayy better! also bonus free breakfast. and the location is perfect. we saw mountinas every where!! definitely choose this place!!!We recently stayed here. The room was clean. The facilities were well maintained. We have stayed at many places in Sedona but this has to be the best bargain in town. Our room actually had a nice view of coffee pot rock.. The best part was the young lady at the front desk, Dasia. She gave us a warm welcome and was very pleasant throughout our stay.The hotel is exactly what you get for the price: tiny rooms, paltry breakfast. That's ok. It's the employees that were so rude and made the hotel awful. Woke up early (at 4 am) and wanted to sit in the 24-HOUR lobby and read since the room was too small and would have woke everyone else up. The night clerk had the lobby locked, didn't want to let me in and finally when she did she said she wouldn't make coffee, or give me a cup of water, nor would she let me turn on the light. Seriously? The door battery died on the morning we were checking out and the clerk wouldn't call maintenance or do anything to help us- she said we just had to leave our door open as we loaded up luggage etc. Who leaves their door open and unlocked? Why would I do that? And she was so RUDE about it. Don't stay here.Room is clean enough but our toilet is clogged twice, even after they fix it. Breakfast room is always full and the food is average. You get what you paidGood location, very clean and reasonable. Manager is very understanding with a situation that existed for us. We will stay again!Rooms.are clean.  Breakfast is bear minimum.  Cinnamon roll is good. Nothing to speak of other than rolls. They were doing some construction so don't try to sleep in.Meh is right.Neither the AC nor fan worked in our stifling hot room. The lady who checked us out was less than sympathetic. The room eventually cooled down with the window open, but what's the point of having a thermostat in the room if it doesn't do anything.The room was very nicely furnished and clean, but  when the primary purpose of a hotel is to have a place to get a good night's sleep, Super 8 missed the mark here.My friend and I were stranded in Sedona past the time our funds allowed due to car problems. I looked online and came across $75 a night and that fit properly into our tiny budget. I figured clean sheets, shower and a pool for $75 a night I shouldn't complain...but WHOA! our room was beyond lovely and clean, they have a nice little ""proper"" continental breakfast that covers all of the basic food groups, and the staff is quite friendly. I was SUPER DUPER impressed!Way to go Super 8!Me likey!Yahoo or Google had a bunch of negative reviews, so I was a bit cautious, but booked it anyway. I ended up extending my stay for 7 nights because I love it here. Okay, I think that it had a lot of lousy reviews a FEW YEARS AGO because it probably was lousy, hehe. BUT, that was before the renovations! I am very happy with my room, the bathroom amenities, the comfy bed, the little fridge, the clean and new lobby and with friendly front desk people, especially lovely Ruth. The most wonderful surprise was a brand spanking new bathroom including a bathtub which was a life saver after all the hours long hikes and walking that I did all around Sedona. I really like it here and am getting a great vibe, very casual, light and unintrusive. I plan to book this place again, and I'll def be back in Sedona! Tomorrow I'm going on the Ye Old UFO Store UFO Sighting Tour!!!! I'll let you know how it went too!!!Thee is a Safeway/Starbucks, Jose Cafe (voted best homecooking for a few years in the row), right across.   Breakfast is served for free. Nothing stellar, but orange and apple juice, toasted waffles, apples, bread for toast, boiled eggs, butter, jam, etc. And some cereal - in containers and in packages, both. Coffee and Tea is available 24/7! Trust this place, everybody here looks happy, and so am I.A good friend of mine stayed here in March--the room was small but very nice. (He as mad it wasn't cheaper. Hello--this is Sedona!) The free breakfast was God awful, the worst I have EVER had at any motel, but the staff were fine. Personally for low cost I would stay at the White House Inn, but this is realty close to my house, Not bad at all, in my opinion.I am writing this review on their service alone, as I haven't actually stayed at the hotel.  I booked a room through Hotwire (first and last time ever), ended up being placed here.  The ""Hot Rate"" was 50% off a $215 room.  This room was booked at $107, which is actually full price.  But that's another review.  Reached out via email to the hotel to determine what kind of room was booked because we are traveling with an infant and wanted to make sure there was room for my little guy as the hotel website didn't say anything about these accommodations.  The GM emailed me back same day (on a Sunday), let me know he was glad I contacted him, there is not, in fact, room in the Single queen room Hotwire had contracted for me, and since it was booked at full price, I could call Hotwire and be refunded and cancel the reservation.  He made arrangements with the front desk to be prepared to cancel my reservation when the representative from Hotwire called.  For this reason, I will consider this hotel in the future when I travel to Sedona and I need a reasonably priced room, and not as much space.If your looking for a one night stay in filth this is your place. Everything is out-dated and over priced. Continental breakfast was so gross my eat anything husband couldn't find one thing besides the cereal that was edible (milk was warm). Coffee tasted 2 days old and juices were basically water. The walls in the hotel room itself looked as though it hadn't been painted since it was built. Carpet was filthy, shower curtain looked as though it had mold and soap scum from previous guests. For the same price we paid for the room we got here we stayed at a 5 star resort up the street the other 2 nights.Yes, I agree this place is a  bit too pricey for a Super 8, but it's also the cleanest, most comfortable Super 8 I have ever visited!The lobby has a computer for guests; the room had a fridge, super-good central heat (not one of those loud wall units), and a giant bathroom with hair drier.The bed, sheets, pillows, and towels were all plush and like new.  The service was outstanding.The only downside was the continental breakfast, which was flavorless and unappetizing, even moreso than most continental breakfasts.After seeing the low rating here on Yelp, I was a bit worried about this one.  I have been to other Super 8's that were pretty dodgy.  However, this visit taking place on Thanksgiving in a touristy town, AND traveling with a dog proved difficult to find an affordable lodging option.  Super 8 fit the bill.  We arrived and were warmly welcomed by the front desk staff.  The room was small but newly furnished, super clean and the bathroom and walk-in shower were huge.  Quiet and comfortable.  Easy and smooth internet access.  Nice sleep and everything we experienced was great. Yes, the price was high for just a Super 8 ($80--though it was a holiday), but we will definitely come back here!This place was very gracious when we arrived quite late after checking out of another Sedona hotel because of bedbugs.  We found this place to be reasonable and clean.  On the way to breakfast the next morning, the incline from our building to the main building was covered in black ice.  Of course I didn't see it and I fell flat on my back.  The management should have salted that immediately first thing in the morning.  They responded immediately when we told them, but ice is ice.  No harm done, but only 3 stars because of that lack of attention.Rude. Long story short they sold our PREPAID room out from under us. The gentleman at the front desk was not only unsympathetic, but down right insulting in his response to our situation. They also lied about trying to contact us ""all day"". The booking company had no record of them ever trying to rectify the situation even though that is what the guy at the front desk said. I will never patronize Super 8 again. Here or anywhere else.","I decided to book Super 8, since I figured I wouldn't be in the hotel much.  I figured if the room was bad, I only had to sleep in it.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The bed was good, no funny smells, AC worked well, and the staff were pleasant to deal with.  It was the cheapest hotel I found in Sedona.  If I return to sedona and need a hotel, I will likely return to the Super 8 for a great value.  Only downside I see is the breakfast...  juice, milk, cereal, bread, waffles, and apples.  Could use a little more variety, as  with all Super 8's I have been to.I stayed at this hotel out of sheer despair and necessity on hour eight of a 10-hour drive when it happened to be the only affordable thing left in town on no notice. That said, I was shocked by the quality  and value for the price, and visited on two subsequent occasions. The best part about this hotel is its location--walking distance to dining options and a Harkins movie theater, and running distance from a hiking area. The rooms were surprisingly nice, clean and spacious for the price point, and the front-desk service was friendly on the three occasions I visited. The breakfast did leave something to be desired, but hotel breakfasts always do.Stayed 3 days - fine, but accidentally double booked the first night.  The Owner is a real jerk not to refund a satisfied customer - even if it was the customer's mistake.  I told him, ""In my business the customer is always right.""  I don't think that's so in his.  My advice, don't be his customer!This is an above average Super 8.  We booked here as all of the hotels the weekend we were in Sedona were beyond pricey.  It certainly is not a resort, but the nice rooms, amazing price, nice views (for view rooms), and convenience more than make up for it.  However, this location is very convenient.  The rooms are recently updated and very clean.  Super comfortable beds.  Free continental breakfast is ok for saving money.  I definitely would stay here again and would splurge on things to do while in Sedona.  Highly recommend.Staff was just friendly enough to get by, but refused to keep our bags until time to check in.  Pretty sure there's mold growing in our bathroom.  ""Pet-friendly"", but when we checked in, we had to sign a contract about all these rules that weren't listed when we made the reservation.  Wouldn't even consider giving us our room before 3.  Even when we came back, our room wasn't ready until 4.  Gets the job done, but really isn't up to par and they aren't here to make your stay exceed expectations.i was forced to stay in sedona because my truck engine blew up on the way to flagstaff. the tow guy brought us to this super 8, not in the uptown area (the main drag), so it was cheaper then having to stay in uptown where resorts &amp; simple hotels will cost a bunch. with a aaa discount, this was $80 a night. still pricey, but not as bad as others. the room had a fridge and microwave. the bed was very uncomfortable &amp; hard. anytime the air kicked on, it sounded like a train coming thru the room. between the bad bed and loud airconditioner, we got no sleep. the front desk was super nice and they do have a full hot breakfast for free. i couldn't stay here again because of the bad beds. so, it depends what's more important to you. nice grounds. has a pool.  so, i don't know.... would $80 a night be moderate in sedona? i would consider it pricey in a different town.",,,"['hotel', 'prices', 'higher', 'side', 'family', 'needed', 'comfy', 'beds', 'clean', 'bathroom', 'since', 'plan', 'eat', 'spend', 'day', 'slide', 'rock', 'hotel', 'minute', 'drive', 'old',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ridge-on-sedona-golf-sedona,The Ridge on Sedona Golf,3.5,$$,55,"Not great, but not bad either. Nothing knocked my socks off about this hotel but it was a decent stay. If you are looking for a hotel with all the bells and whistles, this isn't it. If you're looking for a clean, reasonably priced hotel, this will do. This is not a traditional hotel that offers breakfast, room service, etc. These are timeshares as well, so this would be a good place if you are doing a long stay in Sedona, as they have a kitchen and laundry available. Pros: -comfy bed -in suite kitchen -big bathroom -pool -laundry on site -reasonably priced -close to restaraunts/hiking etc Cons: -no continental breakfast -thin walls, can easily hear neighbors -timeshare sales pitch (just say no right from the start) -not pet friendly -early checkout (10:00)Stayed in a studio and it was okay.  There were beautiful red rocks all around but we had no view.  We stayed near the pool,  which can get pretty loud.  We could also hear our neighbors coming up the stairs,  entering the room,  and talking at times, because we had adjoining rooms.  Overall,  it was a decent room. The restroom wasn't my favorite because it didn't have a bathtub.  The people at the front desk were very nice and helpful.I Forgot to mention that the pillows SUCK!!!!. They are way to big/puffy to sleep on.I will definitely come back here again! They have a pool, gym, Jacuzzi and a golf course! The area is great and close to all the landmarks to see in the area! The rocks and hiking area is a plus in the area. It is a drive from the restaurants and shopping area but it's worth the drive! Plus: couch pulls out into a comfy bed, the kitchen has the basics and everything needed to cook up a meal! The actual bed was comfy as well! It was clean and everything the picture showed prior to purchasing. The bathroom is a great size and the water pressure is hot! Must check it out!The Ridge on Sedona Golf Course Resort was in a beautiful area in Sedona in my opinion.  The place we stayed at was very nice and had a kitchen, washer, dryer, and fireplace.  The kitchen had an oven, microwave, stove, dishwasher, toaster, coffee, and blender.  It was nice and definitely a change of pace from other places we've stayed at.  There was a pool and two Jacuzzi's (one of which was very close to our place).  The Jacuzzi near our place didn't work for one night but was fixed and working the next day.  We used the kitchen to cook some dinner a couple of nights in a row since we didn't want to go out to eat.  All of the appliances worked fine and looked pretty new.  I thought this place was good and was a few minutes from downtown Sedona.If you make the mistake and get a room here- DO NOT get sucked into any of the timeshare presentations!! They will offer $75-$100 just to go, and they will say it's not a ""high pressured"" meeting, but it is. It's actually a huge scam that Diamond resorts is running! As far as the rooms here, they are nice... But this company is all about getting you to become an ""owner"". So once you are in their territory- they will constantly bug he crap out of you to try and attend one of these meetings. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. Any location run or owned by Diamond resorts is pathetic and likes to try and scam their guests.When I came to Sedona 2 years ago, I stayed at Sedona Summit with my mom because she has RCI and timeshare with Diamond Resorts. This time around, I was looking into going through her timeshare but it wasn't working out. So i found a good deal for this place on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotel.com&amp;s=1c9cd25474134bd332ead348e1af3dd34ef04702a504940ac882b95d1297049a"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotel.com</a>. I was a big fan of Sedona Summit, and knowing Ridge is part of Diamond Resorts, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. I booked a studio for $77/a night. 3 nights + hotel fees = $275. I personally thought that was a great deal!The studio came with a full sized fridge, 2 electric stove tops, microwave, coffeemaker, and a dishwasher. We cooked full meals perfectly fine. We went to the hot tub every night we were there. We thought the pool and hot tub near the lobby were the best. The one hot tub near us didn't have a light, but it wasn't that big of a deal. We were offered the timeshare talk and if we went, we were suppose to get a $100 Visa gift card, but we didn't want to waste our time. Location wise, it is on the outskirts of town, not too big of a selection of restaurants but we made due. It's near Bell Rock, so that was the 1st hike we did on our trip! Also not too far are Cathedral Rock, and the Church of the Holy Cross.Absolutely excellent!  We had a one bedroom connected with a studio, so two kitchens and two bathrooms (huge tub), three tvs, laundry closet, two balconies, two living rooms.  We had everything we needed for the perfect vacations for our small family of three.  The decor was up to date, clean, and Sedona appropriate colors.  The kitchens were stocked well with pots, dishes, coffee pot, etc.  The front desk man and the house cleaner were friendly. The location was slightly out of town but in a really nice area near the Sedona Hilton.  We heard very little noise from neighbors aside from NYE cheering.  My husband and child visited the hot tub and pool daily despite the cold weather.  We will try to stay here on our next visit to Sedona.  On a side note, Sedona doesn't have much for children aside from some parks and hiking.I gave 2-stars because I am a Diamond member, otherwise 1-star would be about right. The shower has mold in the corners (noticeable), and the metal door jamb is basically dirty. The pull out couch was dirty and had hot cheeto stains. After pulling it out there were hot cheeto in the seams. When one of my daughters dropped her crayon behind the pull out bed, what did I find? A ton of hot cheetos, oh and someone's deoderant.  The extra bedding was in a plastic bag that was sealed (to prove on some measure that it was clean), but found hairs on the bedding. I spent extra points on this resort because of previous reviews. What a waste :(Driving into the property is pretty, location was ok. Everyone in the front lobby was super polite. But as a Diamond member, the stay was not the best. They were at capacity I was told, so I could not upgrade from our studio. The studio was very small. Although the plus side was it had almost a full kitchen (just no stove...no problem)the blankets for the pull out sofa were thin and very rough. I sleep better with a fan blowing on me no matter how hot or cold it is...and I called the front desk to request one which never got delivered.Good little time share, senior citizen condos, mixed with obviously a resort style ""hotel-condo.""Once you get checked in, you get to go to the concierge desk and they will try to sell you a time share presentation with a ""free"" trip to some decent locations within the states (ie. florida but no hawaii).Parking was decent near the condo and once you walk in, you feel like home.  Why? because you get a nice sized kitchen, large living space/dining area, and a large bathroom and master bedroom.I def. enjoy staying here because it has all you need (except the free breakfast of course).  Will I stay here again? Most likely.  They also have a good sized pool and jacuzzi.However, one star is deducted because of the thin walls and ceilings (and resort fees).I've stayed here twice, in two different room styles.  I'd definitely opt for the bigger 1br (as opposed to the smaller studio) which is incredibly nice by any standard.  A small but nice kitchen, huge living room and bathroom, and comfortable bedroom.  A balcony area is a nice touch as well. Although not walking distance to Bell Rock for most people, it is still convenient to walk down to Cucina Rustica (for some excellent food) and the Full Moon Saloon (for some inexpensive drinks).  I haven't played the course yet, but it looks interesting, so maybe I'll get a chance next time.  Will stay here again, but only in the 1br version.Had a room right by the pool.  loved how spacious this hotel was! Stayed here on a bachelorette trip.. had more than sufficient space to live with 10 girls for a weekend!Staff brought plenty of blankets and ice as requested!!Overall, it's hard to say if I'll come back but I doubt it. Pros: 1)Decent price for the accommodations2) Nice heated 82 degree pool until 10pm3) Condo esq rooms with every amenity you'll need 4) very clean rooms Cons:1) front desk staff are full of incompetents.I did an early check in, hoping to be able to check in a little bit earlier. Front desk staff informed me the room is still being cleaned and that they would inform me when my room was ready. I waited for 4 hrs until when they checked me in at the usual check in time. Multiple parties that arrived after Us got their rooms before we did. It was just ridiculous. Solely for this reason, I would not come back.Great place to stay! Located close to restaurants and shopping We stayed a week and really enjoyed it.The unit was spacious and had a great view . The staff was very helpful and always friendly! Highly recommend staying here.LOVE THIS PLACE! Great value for the price of a nice place to stay in Sedona. The one bedroom will be more than enough room, and the studio really isn't that bad either. Full kitchen and laundry right in the room make it a nice place to just hang out as well. When taking along some guests be sure and get the double room lock-off, as it's great space and privacy for everyone. Even the fold out couches are top notch and don't disappoint as well.Super pretty, awesome.. PoorCustomer service. They clean your room once the whole time your there and they aren't every thorough. They had tons of activities for kids but you had to pay for all of them.. And there wasn't any kids. The movie by the pool activity is free end was the most enjoyed by my kids.Very nice hotel property!!  We stayed 2 nights.  We were supposed to be at their sister property, but they overbooked and moved us here.  Wow!  Are we gld they did.  Our 1 bedroom was small apartment!  Full, stocked kitchen, large 2-person tub.  This would be a great option for an extended stay or with a family.Rooms were a nice size. Very clean resort from the areas that I was able to explore. Staff was pleasant. I would come back.We go North to Sedona fairly often.  I found this place thru a third party timeshare rental for half the published rates (inbox me for details! lol)This is a very well kept Golf Resort.  We visited the club house restaurant for just coffee and a meeting.  They seemed fairly busy with the golfer clique; it was clean and well appointed with a beautiful outdoor patio and gorgeous views of part of the course and mountains.It is not close to downtown Sedona, but there's restaurants nearby, and accommodations on the strip can be sketchy sometimes.  We reserved a studio room with a partial view of the mountains beyond the parking lot.  Our room had a small kitchen and was fully stocked with utensils, cookware, etc.  The room was clean, nice linens, large updated bathroom and a small patio.  Our checkin was fairly fast, and they did direct us to the concierge for the tour promo, and maps.  I read other reviews about the tour push, and the wi-fi.  I wasn't charged for use of the wi-fi, maybe part of whatever rental agreement I found thru a timeshare holder.  They did ask the one time at checkin for us to participate in a tour.  After that we didn't hear from them again.  The wi-fi can lag at times, but it worked fine for the most part.  They are a strict non-smoking property and our room was on the second level of the building, stairs only, which can be a drag if there's a bunch of luggage to haul.  Also, they aren't pet friendly, and if you bring the kids they won't let them into the pool unaccompanied.  This is currently our new go to place and I recommend it.Watch out they will double charge you. Already paid for a room using <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and they also charged is a 2nd time!  When we called no one new what the charge was for and said they need to talk to the manager to resolve.  Still haven't heard anything. Not worth the hassle","I am extremely upset with this hotel's corporate office. I booked a room for 2 nights in October and then read online that they had a bedbug problem at one time. I called to cancel my reservations and they refused to refund me, 5 months in advance! I would never recommend doing business with a company like this. I told them why I wanted to cancel and that made no difference5 stars based on location &amp; a Interval International ""Getaway"" deal of $319 for a week.  Had it been regularly priced, they would have received 4 stars.Great location just outside of town, super close to Bell Rock (a must do hike) and Cucina Rustica, a fabulous restaurant next door.  We got a steal @ $319 for a week in a studio unit.  My sister got the bed &amp; I threw a sleeping bag on the super comfy pull out couch.  The pull out bed was brand new, with a memory foam mattress.  So much more comfortable than the spring kind.Ok pool, nothing special.  We stayed in the #8 bldg, which sported fantastic views.  The kitchen was perfect, small but adequately stocked.  No oven, but I'm fine with that.Bathroom was large, but shower only.  Large closet, room safe, ample sized lanai, updated TV's...... Basically all you need.Pleasant front desk staff.  I truly loved this place.  I'd imagine the whole unit would be awesome to stay in.  However, for two this was more than perfect and well worth the price.2 1/2 hrs from Phoenix and 3 hours from South Rim Grand Canyon.  If you make the trek to the Grand Canyon, realize that if you head back after dark elk are EVERYWHERE and you will need to drive alert &amp; slow.  50+ miles of Elk Hell and the highway also had a few darting by.  Just plan on extra time.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Have a great time, Sedona is such a magical place!*We couldn't do the timeshare presentation bc my husband was not present.  Had we attended it, we would have received a catered breakfast &amp; $75.this place is gorgeous and immaculately clean. the people who helped check us in were the BEST ! totally generous in giving suggestions on what to do, what to see, what routes to take etc. also they showered us with bottled water, chocolates and starbucks coffee. the room was perfect. the bed was super comfy with high thread count linens and dreamy pillows. i'd stay here again ANY TIME !I would definitely stay here again.   The rooms are studios, very clean and the staff was very nice and helpful.  It is within walking distance of several good restaurants and 10 minutes driving distance from uptown.Beautiful location, nice clean and spacious 1 bedroom rooms.  They could improve sound attenuation at the adjoining doors.  The front desk and housekeeping were great but the only negative with customer relations was meeting with the concierge person who was really a timeshare sales person.  Once we told them off the bat that we are not interested in the 90 minute sales pitch the person turned the other way and had nothing more to say or ask us about the resort.  A little more professionalism is needed here.  Just say ""no"" and stick to it and they will leave you alone.  I would have given the resort a 5 if it wasn't for the poor concierge relations.Great value for $150. Full kitchen. Patio. 1 bedroom with living room. Quiet, clean pool. Great views. Clean room, well maintained. Exceeded expectations for the money.I stayed here back in March with a girlfriend for a spring break week in Arizona.  Although we had our whole itinerary planed the staff was very helpful and friendly in helping us settle in and answer an questions regarding activities in Sedona.  The property is a time share so very private and homey. We did have to listen to a presentation but were rewarded with gift cards to two local restaurants.  The rooms were spacious and the pools were nice.  The kitchen was a great perk for a week long trip for cooking and storage.  I think this place is the perfect stop for a family or friends getaway.  We were close enough to everything around to enjoy the beauty of Arizona.Place was nice.  I don't like the ""resort fee""  but at least it wasn't too steep.  Great that there was a kitchen and appliances.  I would stay again.If you can sleep in a bright room, then by all means this is a great place.  If you require a dark room, think again before booking a stay here, as the room is extremely bright!  The kitchen window in the studio room where we stayed had no curtain, merely a shade that lets the sunlight fill the sleeping area.  A blackout curtain over the sliding door but none over the kitchen window does not make for a good night's sleep.  As a matter of fact, I woke up with migraine at about 5am when the sun came out and after attempting to block the light with the laundry basket, towels, and a pillow from the couch, after only having been asleep for a few hours, we eventually moved into the bathroom and slept miserably on the floor in there.  The property is cute, and I would have loved to have had this be a place we would frequent.  However, I found the property staff very unaccomodating after mentioning to them that I was simply uncomfortable paying the amount I had paid when my boyfriend and I had to sleep on the bathroom floor, and were extremely sleep deprived for our time in Sedona due to our stay at their property.  The only compensation that they gave was refunding the $10.00 resort fee, which is about 1/17th of the amount paid.  As a business owner myself, I think this place needs to study customer service and business principles a bit.  I would never dream of treating my patrons that way if they were dissatisfied for any reason whatsoever.  A discount of 30% off of a future stay does not solve the problem, as it is not a future stay that was dissatisfactory, and by leaving a customer dissatisfied, they can pretty much guarantee they will not be a returning customer to use the 30% discount, thus avoiding any kind of compensation for the negative experience whatsoever.Also, a 10am checkout is ridiculous.  I have never heard of anywhere having a 10am checkout prior to staying here, and getting a late checkout here is nearly impossible.  I guess they figure most people will have been awake since 5am when the sun entered their room and don't mind being out by 10.A Balcony,  a View, and That's About It   The Ridge on Sedona Golf Resort is attractive, well situated and well maintained.  The adjacent but unaffiliated golf course, nestled among dazzling views of the area's red rock formations, couldn't be prettier.  But don't expect much service, Just  once during our weeklong stay, they took out our trash and brushed up the room.  There are two heated and pleasant pools but no room service, no bar, no restaurant and no elevator.  Most shops and restaurants are ten miles north in and around Sedona proper.      The Ridge is one of 250-some outposts of Diamond Resorts International, the time-share chain that specializes in selling portable rights to vacation homes, mostly condos.  But nonmembers can often sample the Ridge without committing to buying s time-share.  You can stay a week at discounted rates, though in return, you're urged to sit through an hour-long ""presentation"" about buying a time-share.  Two salespeople park you and your spouse at a card table and make alternating pitches.      For us the Ridge had one great, irrefutable merit.  That was our room, No. 1408, a second-floor, one-bedroom suite with a fully equipped kitchen in Building 14. Staff told us that the buildings were 20 years old. But 1408 felt new. It smelled new. Everything worked, everything fit.  It was remarkably furnished, down to a gas-fueled fireplace and a flashlight for power outages plugged into a kitchen wall.       Many rooms are studios, albeit bigger and better equipped than many a hotel room, and many first floor rooms face parking lots.  Happily, up on the second floor, 1408 came with an unobstructed view of those glorious rocks.   To gauge our flat's space, we counted the doors. There were nine, including a sliding glass door to the balcony where we savored brilliant pageants of sunsets and stars. Thus if like Proust we wanted to root ourselves to a hotel room--not play golf, hike in the rocks, take the two-hour drive north to the Grand Canyon--the Ridge and our room would get five rocking stars.     One complaint--trivial until it wasn't--is the Ridge's advertised Sedona address.   The Ridge is in the unincorporated and little known village of Oak Creek, not in celebrated Sedona.  The night of trek up from Phoenix, the address drove us and our GPS systems nuts.  Finally the Ridge's telephone operator managed to lead us there, turn by turn.This is a hard review to write because the place its self was very nice and clean.  The golf course is beautiful.  But we had bad experiences with the service, this is why I only gave it two stars.  First, they put a hold on your card for $100 and that doesn't come off for at least a week after your vacation.  They tell you a day or two, that's a lie.  Most places only charge $25, if that.  Marriott resorts never charged me anything and they are nicer.  Then the front desk (intern) was not friendly and everything I asked about he said NO.  Which is ironic, because their business card says, ""we are all about Yes"".  Then you get directed to the concierge desk who puts on high pressure to get you to their time share sales pitch.  Internet is $7 every 24 hour period (yes you pay for Internet, everywhere else is free) and that is just for one device.  It was a rip off because it wasn't even fast Internet.  At the end of the trip we went in the night before to ask for a late check out because their checkout is 10am (very early).  Hoping for 11am at least.  They gave the person in front of us a 10:30am check out (30 minutes...big deal) and then they told us NO.  So I called the front desk the next morning to request again and they said NO again.  How is that fair?  Others get it but we don't?  And what hotel doesn't give you an extended checkout?  So the Ridge on Sedona Golf Resort is all about the NO.The rooms were decent, nice little kitchen, no view except for the parking lot, but housekeeping was very good.  Location:  If you like Bell Rock, it is a great location, but if you want to go into town a lot it is far from town and impossible without a car because there are no shuttles only taxi's and they charge $25 each way to town.Great experience! When we asked about the view from our room we were shown pictures of the views and were able to pick the view we wanted. Lots of activities scheduled. Unfortunately, we had a lot of other stuff going on and didn't have a chance to experience any of the activities. Very clean! I enjoyed having a kitchen. It's a little bit off the beaten path, but we really enjoyed being on the outskirts of Sedona.What a beautiful place to stay. My husband surprised me with a mini trip to Sedona for my birthday weekend. The room we had was a studio apartment. We were in 1406P and the bathroom was huge (with just a shower) nice bed, decent size kitchen, smaller size tv, but all in all a great place to stay. They are very serious about there pool towels. To the point that they let you know if any one of those suckers comes up missing, you will be automatically charged $25. They tell you how many should be in each room and I was actually afraid to use said towel for fear of actually getting charged just for using it. LOL! Oh cell phone service is interesting at this hotel. Some spots we had a signal and other spots we got nada. All in all, it was a great resort and we will definitely be back again soon.Free internet &amp; free wine tasting for us when we arrive at 8pm.Service is great.  They hand us wine right away. After 10 hours drive, it is what I need. Is a small town so everything close at 8 or 9pm, so they tell us right away that we should eat first before is too late. I was like, wow... These people actually care!!!! So the roomWe have the studio so...... Kitchen is small as excepted. But they got everything we need. Parking, plenty even on a busy week Nice view, nice pool, nice place, and free wifi everywhere, in the room, the lobby, the pool, everywhere.Had a great week here. The property is gorgeous and overlooks the golf course. The rooms are clean and very spacious. Great kids program with activities. Great location. Nice resort. Would recommend.We are first timers.  Great pool and rooms.  Spacious for two adults and two children.  Nice kitchen, living area, bed and bathroom. Close to beautiful views and national park or monuments. A couple of miles from main shops but thats ok. Three days are enough.  Very nice golf course but i wasnt prepared to play.  79.00 fee and has driving range.  Room has 30 in screen, i home and dvd player. U can rent dvds at registration for two bucks.  About 100 reg dvds and about 50 for kids.  Only thing, no free wifi.  I would come back.I booked our stay through VRBO. This was our very first time visiting Sedona and I have to say my biggest disappointment was selecting this ""resort"". Check in was busy and took forever. They then try to steer you to the concierge desk (aka sales desk) where they try like the Dickins to sell you a timeshare. They are relentless. We were told this was a child friendly place as well as it was advertised ""no resort fees"". Neither were the case. It was more geared towards an older crowd and they hit me with those $21 in resort fees upon check out claiming it was for wifi. If they mean the super slow wifi that kept timing out, what a rip off!! The beds our horrible, we had no view. I take that back, we had views of the maid quarters and a busy street. The street noise was also very loud. When asked how my stay was, I told them and they simply brushed it off. They could care less about their guests. Just swiped my credit card for their resort fees and sent me on my way.  They care more about trying to sell you a timeshare then caring for their guests! Never Again!!!!This place is awesome!  We only stayed 1 night but the staff was super helpful and friendly! I would definitely come back and definitely recommend it!  Ashley at the front desk was amazing! Free internet, workout room, and pool. There is a $10/night resort fee, but Priceline had already added it to the cost.This place is a pit.   After trying 3 rooms we finally got one that didnt smell but they did have to come back and vaccum.  The first vaccum was broken, and the maids just didnt bother,  so got another one.  I had to sweep the front porch off with renants of tissue and bugs.   Wont stay here again.   All three roooms we trid were just as dirty.   YukEh. We stayed here via a timeshare trade. We own at a gold star resort. I traded a sleeps four unit that has a big, full sized kitchen for a studio at this resort. Pros: nice location, on the edge of town but not far from the main portion of town. Grocery, nice restaurants, etc are close by. Nice, well maintained pools. Most of our 2nd room was fairly maintained. Most of it was clean but the carpet could use an update. We experienced nice staff but some others we spoke to did not. The concierge was very helpful. They offered free washers and dryers at the laundry facility.Skip the welcome wine and cheese. It was a tiny table with broken up crackers, big lumps of grapes that were not broken up for guests to share, the wine was way too young to serve and the woman serving it even said the same. There was virtually no interaction among the guests.Cons: I called a day ahead telling them please give us a nice room, this was our wedding anniversary. Ha, waste of a phone call. When we arrived at 5pm, we were told that there was some confusion and that the person in our room before us had not yet left, or maybe they just checked in...they weren't sure ... What? They asked us to wait 10 minutes while they went and checked the room...again. Then we were told they had another room for us, the only room available which was a ""modified"" room. A room designed for the handicapped. I said NO. I did not want a room such as that although I appreciate there are rooms available for those that need them. Then we told to go talk to the concierge while they figured out what to do. Then we were told the room was ready. Lol...the only problem was that Goldilocks beat us to our bathroom. The shower was wet, the soap opened and used, the only bath towel hanging on the rack wet, the toilet seat up and the sink wet.  Upon a call that this wasn't going to work we were told again that the only room available was the handicap assessable room. My husband again said no to that. Where were they putting the lobby full of people that now arrived behind us? We got another room. It was clean. Carpet could be cleaner. Sofa lumpy and the seams coming apart. Bed as hard as a rock. Housekeeping brought new towels but no vacuuming, or cleaning the soapy mess the provided yucky soap made. We weren't even there, we had stayed at the Grand Canyon while housekeeping came in so there was virtually an empty room. While the resort offers beautiful views and a nice looking golf course, I don't think it should be rated as a Gold Star with Interval International, and I will be letting them know it. Btw, we met another guest at the pool who told us almost a duplicate story. Beware if you are trading, you are considered 3rd in line behind owners and potential buyers.","Negative stars for the immediate hard sale for time-share ownership at check-in! We were charged $20 to reserve a showing of the condos, refundable if we go to the viewing. All this just to check-in and get a parking permit!  We already own a time share and had traded a week here.4 stars for the room decor, bed was so comfy, textured carpet, nice tile and the sofa-bed was different, it actually supported you as you slept!Only 2 stars for sound-proof of walls and ceilings.  SOUNDS like no insulation. Two pools a bit spread out for all of the property buildings. We were lucky to be close to the second pool. Hot tub is separated from the pool areas, kinda nice as we were the only ones there each night. It is a walk to get there, but the sunset is beautiful!We were in an updated room that was really nice. Being on the golf course was great, but we didn't take in a round. With the pay for activities, pay for local calls, $20 pressure to get the parking permit, we felt ""nickel and dimed"" on our stay.For the golf course, updated room and beautiful views, you'll have to decide if you want to go through the time-share hard-sale!It's true, it's a Diamond time share resort. And, we were offered to take a time share tour w compensation, which we declined. Still, everyone was very nice and helpful. It's true, you must pay extra for Internet, only shortcoming. Room was lovely, well apportioned and clean. Pool was perfect temperature! Glorious area, just wish we had a room with a view of the red rocks, but I'm not sure if any studios have views. And, truthfully got so many beautiful views just driving around! Beautiful area! p.s. August is apparently monsoon weather, didn't know. :)Left yesterday and could not have been happier. Its south of Sedona, but just minutes away. Sedona itself is a tourist zoo. The ridge gives you easy access to all the activities and their golf course is pristine. We had a studio which was plenty big for 2 people. It comes well stocked with about anything you could ask for. Every Staff member we encountered went over the top to be helpful. We can't wait to return...After reading some of the reviews we were a little skeptical about this place.  Having said that my husband and I recently stayed at the Ridge after looking at a rental ad on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fredweek.com&amp;s=8e0dfe02f563f9548f3203b83ad0369b6dc5dd5de7dbe4fd1496e2a20c8ef3aa"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">redweek.com</a>  Instead of paying rack rate going directly through the resort (which is very expensive) we found an great deal for a fully loaded one bedroom unit with an amazing view of the red rocks.  We felt completely private and did not hear anything from any other rooms, despite what we read on another post.  We found the staff to be really helpful, the supervisor Kiley (sic) even checked with us to see if we were happy with our room.  The concierge desk was also top notch, guiding us to activities and restaurants that were definitely among the best that we had researched.  They also offer discounts for activities and restaurants that otherwise one would not get.  They definitely asked if we wanted to go to a presentation (this is their bread and butter after all) but we politely declined and were not hounded in the least.  Having said that, if you do choose to spend 90 minutes of your time they give you a $50 visa card, which beats a sharp stick in the eye!  The pool and hot tub were divine.  Everything was really well maintained.  We stayed in a remodeled unit  but having said that we looked at the unremodeled units and they were fine as well.  I guess the trick is to talk to the front desk when you check in about where you want to stay and what kind of view you want, because they will definitely do their best to accommodate you.I also heard about two other websites that do rentals, <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftug2.com%2Ftimesharemarketplace%2F&amp;s=3c2322efccdef5a5182a92434330dcba275c63035a4b9bed2673bf111a7cd750"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">tug2.com/timesharemarket...</a>  and <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyresortnetwork.com&amp;s=014b3cecf6d23e3858e09c82da3fcb2bb9a07d315f35ec119823b7235d1c3734"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">myresortnetwork.com</a>  People who own these timeshares will make really great deals.Got a deal through Groupon for this resort.  I don't think I would have found this resort without the Groupon it is near a Hilton resort.  Then again everything is tucked in from the main drag.  It was clean and for the most part quiet.  We stayed in a studio that was a little smaller there is an adjoining door to the larger suite.  Our neighbors were noisy.  It is located in the Village of Oak Creek and the views are pretty nice.  They supposedly have a nice golf course but we didn't get a chance to check this out.  We did however do a hike nearby Turkey Creek.Stayed at this resort just a week ago with my husband and was disappointed. This was a ""short stay exchange"" through my timeshare management company. We stayed there for 4 nights: checked-in Wed, checked-out Sunday.My review will go along with a lot of other reviewers:Pressure right away to book a viewing of their timeshare. We had to say ""NO"" at least 8 times (I counted...) and when we refused, the ""concierge"" (a.k.a. timeshare salesperson) changed her attitude towards us. What a turn off! :-/They do not do a good job at training their personnel. Upon check-in, we were told that we would get housekeeping only on Friday, since we weren't staying for the full week. Well, we did NOT get any housekeeping at all! We stayed there for 5 days!!! I had to take out the trash myself, which is really not a big deal, but my point is that the expectation was created with the incorrect information given by their employee. Besides, really?! This is a ""resort"". Pamper your clients a little bit, would you? It's just a service you should be providing pretty much everyday in a hotel environment!!!The other bad training moment was when I approached the front desk and inquired about the fact that they have a really well equipped kitchen (including pots and pans, dishes, etc... basically everything), but no place to use the pots and pans. We brought food with us to try saving some money, since we would have a ""kitchen"". BEWARE: There is no cooking surface in the studio units. So, when I asked the the person behind the desk about it, she simply answered: ""We do not have stoves in the studios"". My reply was: ""So then why have all these equipment available? It seems extremely wasteful to me!"" The manager overheard us and approached saying that they do provide a cooking surface, but only upon request. Well, I wish I knew that from the start. I would have taken one with me as soon as I checked-in. They provided an electric two burner portable stove and it did the job just fine.We stayed in one of the non-renovated units. Of course ""it did the job"" just as good as a newly renovated unit would have done. But it was weird seeing part of the tv programs cut on our 25"" tube tv and it was not relaxing to take a shower in a bathroom covered in wall paper from the 80's!! But the bed was comfortable...About the sound insulation... Yeah... THERE'S NONE! We were unlucky to be next to a couple with two kids who woke up at the crack of dawn and everyone else along with them. At the same time, we were feeling super bad about staying up a little late, having some wine and talking, since we knew the ""neighbors"" were probably being kept awake by us. Not as fun  as it could have been...Love the location, closer to Freeway exit since southern Oak Creek area.  Makes it easier to jump to Phoenix and Flagstaff activities. Accommodations seem nice at first but not top quality.  The pull out beds for our teens were memory foam type mattresses, so much better than you would expect.Not quite as nice as Sedona Summit, but as a sister Diamond Resort, we did enjoy our stay here. Maybe if we were golfers we would have liked it a little bit more.  I still definitely have to give it better than average though.Love beautiful Sedona!  Initially we were happy with our purchase of a timeshare. So we chose to use our time at the Ridge at Sedona Golf Resort. But when we actually stayed there the annoyance began. Constant calls to attend their presentations, Who wants to waste precious vacation time to attend a presentation?  We were talked into attending some presentations--they last over two or more hours. The pressure was major. When we didn't choose to buy more time we were ushered out the back door. No champagne for us cheapskates! One salesman was so furious we wouldn't buy that he had us sign a paper that we wouldn't attend any more presentations.  Fine with us. But guess what? We still got calls and invites to more presentations. Their presentations were called ""updates"". No way. Nothing but a lengthy high pressure sales pitch. Are you ready to purchase more time? Cost is $5000-$10,000 plus maintenance fees of approx $650? The Ridge at Sedona Golf Resort is comparable to apartment living. RSGR is made up of many two story units packed tightly onto the property with the only grounds being the perimeter golf course. Pool and spa were inconvenient--a distance away, up and down steep stairs. So we never bothered. We like the high quality five star Arroyo Roble Resort in uptown Sedona 100 percent better!We stayed mainly in one bedroom units.  Beware the inner door leading to the next door unit is not always locked. I tried it and found my next-door neighbor sleeping. Surprise! This timeshare (Sunterra) made for years of annoyance with their constant calls. We finally unloaded it--couldn't sell it but actually donated to charity. We are happy now to be rid of that albatross!We enjoyed our 5 day stay at the Ridge. Only negative is they give you no free Internet or WiFi service which surprised us being such a really nice place. Sheets were absolutely wonderful and I understand you can buy new ones like the ones they use in the rooms there. We were in a 1 bedroom suite and felt like we were in our own apartment, with a beautiful view of the golf course and some of the rock mountains we could see from our balcony.Having read some reviews, I didn't know what to expect.      Let's just say that I think we got a renovated studio cuz it had a cooking surface(stove) in the unit.  We had some issues(ex. non-cooling a/c unit and a missing dvd remote) with the studio which were quickly attended to by the staff(within 30 min of notification).       Upon first inspection, the place was clean and presented well.  But the midweek housekeeping was lacking.  According to the front desk, the midweek cleaning consisted of sweeping, vacuuming, towel replacement and bed made with fresh sheets.   I can't verify the first two, but the towels were replaced and the beds were not made.  Maid service was okay.     Our mistake was to attend the ""90 minute"" presentation.  The 90 minutes turned into 3 hours of ""hard sell"" when I finally didn't want to answer any more questions.  They gave us a discount for a tour for our trouble.       I'll go again sans the presentation.I have no complaints about this place except no free wi-fi.  Also there's hardly any cell phone service unless you have Verizon, but that's not their fault.  The room was nice and we didn't hear anything from our neighbors except once when they ran the dishwasher or something.  They did forget to clean our room on Friday, but I assume that was just a mistake and the usual fair.  I like the fact that there's an almost fully equipped kitchen.  It saved us a lot of money on food.  They did ask us to attend a spiel when we checked in, but didn't bug us about it other than that.We stayed in a one-bedroom unit as timeshare owners in Jan. 2010 during the ""Storm of the Century.""  Our only real problem was that there was not much to do in Sedona nor at the resort during inclement weather.  We were able to get one of the newly-refurbished units, and the appliances and decor were top-class.  Our view was medium, but not bad.  (We were offered a unit with a better view, but older furniture and appliances and without the flat-screen TV).The hot tub is pretty, but the pool was too cold to swim in and while the hot tub was a great temperature, it had no roof and one had to go up several flights of stairs in the dark and cold to access it.  The resort should have at least an indoor or partially-protected hot tub and safer way to reach it.They did have a great talk by a Navajo in full costume, and a concert by a Shawnee flautist; my companion ended up buying one of his flutes.  It would be great if the resort had more such events.They charged $4 a night to rent videos and $6.95 per day (possibly per computer) for internet [although we were able to use the computers over in the lobby a good bit by going in at night].  It seems insulting after paying so much already to own a timeshare, and since other timeshares offer such things for free and have more indoor entertainment.  The resort could provide game nights, more ways for guests to meet each other, show films that were made in Sedona, etc., without much cost to themselves but it would provide a nicer experience during winter weather.On Wednesday night they offered Bingo and Mexican food for $15 which sounded fun, but we were not able to go because we had already purchased tickets for the Verde Canyon Railway.WE WERE HOUNDED EVERY DAY TO ATTEND A SALES PRESENTATION.  I FELT THEY WERE SHOWING ME DISRESPECT BY CONTINUING TO ASK TIME AFTER TIME.  Unfortunately, it seems that all timeshares are like this.  The staff was friendly and polite, especially the valet and the man who helped us carry our things to the car when we left, but no matter how politely people ask you to attend a sales presentation, after you've kindly made it clear several times that you do NOT wish to go, it's harassment to continually be asked.I wavered between two and three stars.  The place is a timeshare so beware.  They will try exceptionally hard to get you to attend a sales presentation.  I had to refuse repeatedly and they even called my room!  You know, if I had any interest in buying something like it, I'm sure I would pursue on my own and not have to have someone hound me repeatedly in some hope that I'd buy on impulse.  The location is nice, right on a golf course and the grounds are very well taken care of.  The room we had seemed more like a studio apartment rather than a hotel room.  The walls are thinner than paper, and you can hear a pin drop in the room next door.  The decor in the room was old, warn and in dire need of replacement.  The carpet was stained in several places and the wallpaper in the bathroom was very dated and peeling.  The TV was a piece of crap, 25"" tube style TV from the stone ages.  Here's the kicker...NO MAID SERVICE.  WTF?????  We stayed a week and all they did is come one day and replace the towels.   The pools and jacuzzi are not even close to being convenient to all the rooms.  We had to walk up a long, long hill to get to the pool or jacuzzi.  Really inconvenient.   The location is nice, right in the red rock area of Oak Creek.  But really?  The place is NOT a hotel worth the prices they charge.  I think they have remodeled some of the rooms, but certainly not ours!  They play a trick on you and try to sucker you in to a sales presentation when you go to a SECOND desk to get a parking pass.  Parking pass?  Really?  There's nothing nearby that would cause unauthorized parking so it's nothing more than a ploy to sucker you in.  What a joke......  We really loved Sedona, it is just an amazing place, so thankfully the hotel was nothing more than a place to sleep at night and spend a l little time in the pool and jacuzzi.    Reminder.....the WALLS ARE THIN AS PAPER !!!  I swear you can hear your neighbor thinking.When you walk into the lobby, with the fireplace, warm undertones, plasma TV's, you think ""hmmm, I bet my room will be just as inviting.""  Sadly, that is not the case.  We stayed in a Studio unit and the best thing I can say about it is that it was clean.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the walls are so thin so that you can hear when your neighboring room dwellers are snoring.  The Studio has a kitchenette with pots, pans, utensils, dishes... but no stove.  I guess you could take the pots and pans out to the BBQ, but I think they'd get ruined.  We made due with the microwave and toaster, but it did feel like just a step up from camping.  Initially, our TV didn't work, but they did get a repairman out quickly to fix it.  The control on the air conditioning &amp; heat requires that it's either on or off, so it gets really cold or really hot - it also makes quite a bit of noise.  The jacuzzi/spa is really inconvenient, up a winding pathway with stairs.  I will seek other accommodations for our next trip to Sedona.",,,"['great', 'bad', 'either', 'nothing', 'knocked', 'socks', 'hotel', 'decent', 'looking', 'hotel', 'bells', 'whistles', 'looking',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-plus-arroyo-roble-hotel-and-creekside-villas-sedona,Best Western Plus Arroyo Roble Hotel & Creekside Villas,4.0,$$$,56,"We were on a trip out west and purchased an express deal through Priceline for a one night stay in Sedona.   It had been a long time since I've stayed in a Best Western and this we found was a Best Western Plus.  The room more than exceeded our expectations.  We were well pleased with room size, bathrooms, cleanliness,  and all the amenities.  The staff were friendly and welcoming.  The view of Oak Creek and the mountains surrounding was outstanding.    The free breakfast, which we usually skip because they are usually totally carbs, is served in an adjoining building and was really done first class.Unfortunately, we stayed in another Best Western Plus the following week which did not meet our expectations so this is a designation that still deserves caution but not, fortunately, at this location.Hello all, I'm posting as a newlywed and honeymooner from Phoenix, AZ. I found this place on trip advisors and man, all the reviews were correct! Our room was the north room with the jetted tub and fireplace! Honestly, probably the only room I would stay in staying at this hotel. It's tucked away with three other rooms off to the side with spectacular views! The bed is EXTREMELY comfortable! The cleaning ladies are amazing and nice. The bathtub and shower is AWESOME! Breakfast in the morning you can't beat. The steam room and hot tub in the clubhouse is well worth it. The only NEGATIVES I give this place is the front office staff about half of them didn't care about their job. We were watching a movie and the tv is across the room from the bed and it only turned up volume wise half way. I get that in a hotel they don't want you blasting your tv. We couldn't even hear the tv, so my husband called. It was late but she was rude and said she would call us back to see if they could fix it and she NEVER did. Also, the wifi sucks. We tried using our Amazon fire stick for Netflix, and it was a no go. Overall it's been a great experience. Stay in the north rooms, you won't be disappointed!They have nicely decorated rooms. We've been here before and always enjoyed it there. For a Best Western its excellent. Its close to everything. Their beds are super comfy. Checking in at the front desk everyone is friendly and knowledge about Sedona. They have a great of selection of rooms. Not your average best western. The Free breakfast is pretty good if your in a hurry. Its basic and fresh. Coffee was good. We normally like to eat breakfast at the Coffee pot.Great view of Snoopy Rock, great location. Sunrise was spectacular from my balcony. Lots to do on site. Almost like a spa. Better breakfast than most Best Westerns. The staff was very friendly and helpful.Multi-level indoor/outdoor hotel. Comes with a beautiful view of the rocks (on one side of the hotel only!), and free access to the Arroyo Roble club house with spa, indoor/outdoor pool &amp; hot tub, pool tables, ping pong, etc.. This hotel also had one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever had -- actually worth paying for. The eggs with green chiles combined with bacon, home fries, and salsa made a great meal. The coffee was quite good for a hotel too -- I had seconds. PS: the salsas were delicious -- they had two different types, both of which seemed freshly made and one of which was quite spicy! I wish all hotel breakfasts were like this.We absolutely loved this place, though we stayed in the one private ""cottage"" out back, so I can't speak to the quality of the rooms in the main building. If you can, grab the cottage- it has two big bedrooms, large bath, a kitchenette, dining room and living room. You also have a private driveway for your car and an incredible unobstructed view of the red-rock mountains from a private back deck with patio furniture. It all feels very exclusive and romantic...until you find unsupervised children wandering down from the main building...hanging out on your deck, peeking through your windows and climbing on your car.Be a responsible parent, that's the message tonight folks. Your obnoxious delinquent kids aren't nearly as cute as you seem to think they are.I was very impressed with this hotel. The location is awesome it's a right in the uptown Sedona area if you want to all the shops some great restaurants and also too many activities. The room is a standard hotel room we had two queen beds with the balcony and the view of the red rocks. They have a clubhouse that has an indoor/outdoor pool which was very nice. The clubhouse also has a steam room, sauna and a rec room with Foos ball ice hockey and lots of other games. There are two hot tubs in the clubhouse - one outside and another inside. They offer free breakfast in the morning with eggs, waffles and potatoes. All in all the Best Western Plus was a very nice place to stay. They also have access to the creek which provides great hiking trails just off the property.We just stayed at the Best Western Arroyo Roble Hotel in Sedona, Az.  It was very nice, clean rooms with a terrace to sit on and see the beauty of Sedona!    The Best Western is also dog friendly and they have a nice grassy area with doggies bags for your fur babies.  But call ahead to reserve your room ( with dogs ) because they only have two dog friendly rooms.  Plus!  They have a fabulous complimentary breakfast with all the fixing!!  .  Plus two  pools and many other amenities.  We will definitely return to the Best Western Arroyo Roble when we go back and visit Sedona!I really liked this hotel. Better than ones I've stayed at. Rooms are beautiful, lots of activities, located near the shopping center, and AMAZING VIEW!! Staff is nice! Only think was room service was not to the door just picked up at the front. But honestly the stay here was so worth it. Breakfast was awesome too :)We had the pleasure to stay at your hotel. We are RCI members and weren't able to get in the timeshare section. I have to say the views are amazing and the location to the shops in uptown is perfect and the free breakfast was wonderful along with staff.  The only reason why I gave your property a 3 Star over 5 Star is the playground down in the timeshare part wasn't clean. The playground equipment had a ton of cobwebs and the ladder was very loose. I was able to tighten the nut with with my fingers on the left side. I also find it interesting getting down to equipment wasn't easy for my elderly mother who found it hard to walk down several steps. Why isn't there a ramp?I realize it's not apart of your hotel but you allow your guests to use these facilities and equipment so it needs to be kept up with open communication between both hotel managers.This place is the bomb.Walking in to the lobby, you are greeted by a very professional front desk. They are super nice and accomodating.The entire resort was clean and big! They have a recreational facility with an indoor &amp; outdoor pool, sauna, spa, pool tables, ice hockey, fusball, and more! The gym was not bad either.Room was fantastic too. Great view. Breakfast included.Arriving in Sedona from Wisconsin is nothing short of inspiring. As the vista unfolds it becomes abundantly clear this is a special place. Best Western Arroyo Roble does justice to the surrounding beauty. Comfortable updated villas along the creek were a relaxing home away from home (better than home, really ;) )  Great breakfast, friendly responsive staff. Stay here!So you know the housekeepers  rules the hotel, screaming, talking, laughing early in the morning in the hallways. Do not matter if sign do not disturb is on or not.Bathrooms are very small.Just arrived at this hotel and it's already a horrible experience. After a four hour drive from Las Vegas, the person checking people in in the lobby takes one look at my boyfriend and I. Doesn't ask me for my name and immediately assumes we are staying at the other CHEAPER Best Western down the street. She then proceeds to inform me that our room may not be clean, note that we arrived almost at midnight. I made my reservation a week ago and there is no room, which we have already been charged for and we have paid in full for. She doesn't offer us any comfort or even another available option, just hot coffee or tea. Chose this hotel over other options because of the rave reviews but I am definitely regretting my decision. We are sitting in the lobby and she has not provided us with any solutions and have not informed us of what our options are.Terrific attention from Nicole and Lonnie. Fabulous views from a private balcony. Right in the heart of the entertainment district and walking distance to everything. When I return, this is THE spot!FANTASTIC views!  If you are staying here, request a mountain view room.  Natural Beauty right at your window.  They also have complimentary breakfast that is actually very good.  Clean rooms, great service.  We stayed here during a vacation in late February 2013...We couldn't have asked for more!Excellent accommodations! Perfect in every way. Such a pleasant stay, great breakfast, welcoming staff, serenity, nature, walking distance to the creek and shops! Such a pleasant environment and pleasant people! Claudia is an awesome concierge. Gets ya what ever you need and has answers to all your questions. Love it here!This was an excellent place to stay in Sedona!! We had our 3 month old and our golden retriever and the hotel was accommodating for both. The views were spectacular and the property has beautiful lawn areas and a nice place for pets. The breakfast was phenomenal! The location was great as well! We will definitely be back!!Loved my view, my room,  and my amenities! Would highly recommend to any one traveling there for work or leisure.  We were there for work but all I wanted to do was enjoy the view! Clean rooms and nice staff and great breakfast!Great view... Treated like scum by the best western staff at breakfast. Went to grab some breakfast for my wife and son, asked if they had any paper plates or to go box so I could take the food back to our room. The lovely hostess replied ""um, we don't do that here""... I said can I take some fruit for my son? He's sick and constipated""... She said ""you can have one banana"". Disrespectful, irritating, totally uncalled for.The price of my room definitely wasn't worth it... But again, great view.Holy moly... I have to add to this review...So I got my boy dressed and took him to BW breakfast. Ate a bit, and put a 4 pieces of bacon in a napkin for my wife... Let the bus boy know I was taking my boy to go potty and we'd be right back, so please don't clear the table... Came back 1 minute later... Everything's gone... No more bacon being served... Perfect way to start the day.","Well all I can say is that Best Western isn't just any ordinary hotel any more. A girl friend and I decided to stay in a condo at the Best Western Arroyo and all I can say is wow!! I'm very picky about where I stay. This condo exceeded my expectations. It was a two bedroom, 2 bath condo that say right on Oak Creek. The bathrooms were the bomb!! The master bath had marble sink, jacuzzi tub and a beautiful walk in shower. The lighting in the bathroom was incredible. The condo also had a small kitchen, dishwasher and a washer and dryer.  The living room had Flatscreen w/DVD player. In fact all the rooms had flat screen. When opened the slider to walk about we were but feet from the creek! It was gorgeous here.. To fall asleep with the sound of a rushing creek was beyond unbelievable. The property has so much to offer here. Would stay here In a heart beat again. They also served breakfast. Just wish they would serve a little later, for those who like to sleep in.  Our trip was perfect with the help of Best Western, I use to pay the same amount to stay at Enchantment Hotel and spa and it didn't even come close to what this condo offered. Luv it!! So worth it!!Not your typical Best Western.Recently stayed here for 2 nights during a trip to Sedona.Great location........ walking distance to uptown shops and restaurants.This hotel has 3 different sections to it so I'm sure it is different depending on which area you stay in.There is the main hotel which I think is 6 stories high. Then there is the Roble North Rooms which are 5 rooms that are in their own little area. 2 on the ground floor and 3 on the second floor. These rooms are upgraded and larger than the standard hotel rooms and come with their own parking area.They also have condos which are next door that seem to be part of a timeshare.We stayed in a ground floor Roble North Room.The room was large with a huge bathroom with huge shower with rain shower head and body sprays plus a separate Jacuzzi tub.There is also a fireplace, small fridge and microwave, room safe, sitting area and large TV. ..... not to mention a great view of the red rocks and beautiful outside lawn area.The room was super clean. I am a hotel freak and I do an entire """"Anthony Melchiorri from Hotel Impossible"" type room inspection on all rooms I stay in.This place was clean!!...... really clean.The pricing is higher than most Best Westerns... we paid $225 per night plus taxes!$505 out the door for 2 nights.But included in the price is a full buffet breakfast in their breakfast room.Normally we always pass on the included breakfast because they are so bad........ but not at this place. It was very impressive.The food was good and many different choices.... eggs, potatoes, breakfast meat, yogurt and granola, fresh fruit, waffles, egg casserole, oatmeal, muffins and a couple different juices. The food was good. We ate there both days and I'm sure that saved $30 each morning compared to going out. Probably the best hotel breakfast buffet I have ever seen.The hotel has many amenities which are next door at the condo complex... nice pool, tennis courts and racquetball courts. There is also a small creek that you can walk to which is behind the condo complex. It is all very scenic.I will definitely return here on my next trip to Sedona!Great views. Nice location. The grounds are amazing. The room is nice with balcony. When a stranger tried to get into my room at night because the staff double assigned the same room number (during my occupancy), not a fan. Also, there were problems with the keys. After checking in, I tried to get into the room, but the keys didn't work properly and the front desk had to reset the keys. Perhaps the stranger struggling to get into my room ran into the same key issue and that's possibly the only reason why they didn't just walk in on me in the room, thankfully I was able to catch them at the door. Hopefully that was a one in a million and doesn't happen again.The Hotel is very nice. The amenities were very nice. However the staff was not very hospitable. They were not friendly or welcoming at all. Considering, we did pay a lot of money to stay one night, it would have been nice if the staff were friendlier. The breakfast food was  not that great also. I probably wouldn't stay there again.Overall, a good place to stay in Sedona.  Location is excellent, views are breathtaking, pool is kid and parent friendly, nice staff, yummy hot breakfast, and the place is quiet.  I would return without question.The only thing I noticed was that the bathroom floor was not cleaned while we were there.  The dark hairs on the tile floor were still there after two housekeeping visits.Really impressed. I took my mom here and we were booked in a room with two Queen beds, a DVD player, balcony with a view. The room was spacious and clean and the beds were so comfortable I miss sleeping in them on a regular basis. I wasn't a Best Western sort of person but I am quickly learning that they are a more reliable brand to stay at and having a club card doesn't hurt either. The breakfast is served in a nice dining area. They had a large variety of foods to choose from every morning, including waffles. If you get there early enough you can beat the crowds. The pool has beautiful views of the red rocks. I enjoyed having an early evening swim. Music played in the pool area while I floated around and enjoyed the Arizona sky. They also have access to a gym over at the time share area. Even the treadmills have a great view. The location is almost perfect and located right at the end of town. We started at the shops on the hotel side of the street, went all the way down and then circled back and shopped on the other side before returning to our room. The staff were exceptional, talkative, and helpful. Keep in mind you are paying a bit more for the views, this is not a full-service hotel.Fabulous place. Great views of the surrounding area and right next to airport Mesa.  Short drive to downtown. Room was clean, as far as I could tell. They didn't always change all the sheets. Just tucked them in. Maybe hotels don't change sheets anymore? Breakfast bar was fine. Edible. Good variety.  Service was also fine at checkin and checkout.We stayed in a room with a view of the rock mountains and a balcony. It was beautiful and the room was clean and comfortable. it also was a great location to be able to walk through a lot of shops and to restaurants.  We did drive down to the Tlaquepaue village for shopping. The breakfast isn't as grand as it was advertised to be. it is a nice continental breakfast with the usual, cereal, toast, pastries to help your self to. Make your own waffle. Then they had a few hot dishes out, frittata type of things.  It was good.  I would stay here again if we came to Sedona again.No offense, but I almost cannot believe that this is a Best Western!  This is a very nice and clean hotel sitting on prime real estate. The hotel is located right in the heart of downtown Sedona. You can choose to take a nice stroll downtown, or just enjoy the very nice view of the mountains from the hotel pool.  I would highly recommend staying here.I researched a lot and am picky about places I stay. This was tricky bc my mom was joining my family of 4 and trying to find a place that accommodates all of us is not easy. We ended up staying at the Creekside Villas here. They're basically condos facing the creek. Beautiful! There are 2 floors, with 2 bedrooms upstairs. One is the master with it's own bedroom,another with a separate bathroom. The bathroom tile is dated and makes it look dingy, I would opt for an upgrade on the bathroom decor but everything was clean.  Downstairs is a kitchen with a sofa bed, a dining area. My kids slept on the sofa bed so grandma could have her own room. They loved it! It was incredibly comfortable, just like a reg bed. Just a note, we've stayed at the Trump hotel in Vegas also using the sofa bed for our kids and it was extremely lumpy and not at all comfortable so this was a big surprise! The kitchen in nice and there's even a washer/dryer to the side. They even include tide and bounce. No need to bring your own. We stayed 3 nights and did 2 loads, had some detergent leftover. If you're in Sedona, you have to be a nature lover. Along with the great red rocks come cicadas. They are everywhere!  We swam in the pool and went from the indoor to the outdoor pool ( there's a little swim way to go to the outdoor one). We ended up just swimming in the indoor one bc there would be dead cicadas in the outdoor one. Also, there in the screens in the sliding doors too. Ick.Other than than, the stay was very pleasant. Plus, everyone who works there is extremely friendly! I mean everyone! Great stay for families.Great experience!  From the time we walked in the door until the moment we left.  The night auditor was the first person we encountered and she was fabulous!  She was friendly and a wealth of knowledge on the surrounding area.  Every staff member went out of their way to make sure our stay was comfortable and stress free.  And oh my!  We had a view that was priceless.  Definitely would recommend this hotel for your Sedona visit.  My Visit was from 4-8 Jan 15.I stayed here with a couple of friends on an AZ hiking trip in Sept. We all loved this place.The front desk was nice and accommodating when 2 of our friends couldn't make the trip. They also gave me a box and some tape to protect a fragile item I'd purchased on my trip. We stayed on the ground floor of the main hotel with a garden and fountain area and spectacular view of the red rock mountains. The room was lovely with nice amenities and especially comfortable beds. We found the breakfast to be superb -- so much better than the typical complementary breakfasts at other places. The food was tasty with lots of variety. Would definitely stay here -- an incredible deal for less than $200/night.Needed to book a place for 1 night in Sedona las minute and Priceline had 1 room left and I took it.  So happy I did.  The hotel is right at the beginning of Sedona's main street which meant everything was walking distance.  Restaurants, coffee shops, clothing boutiques and tour companys all within a quarter mile of the hotel. The property itself was really impressive for a Best Western.  The hotel has an outdoor pool but on the same property, the time share club house has an indoor/outdoor pool and jaquzzi, a private creek, picnic area and playgound.  All of this is available to the hotel guests and time share holders.  Breakfast is definitely a step up from the usual pastries, juice/coffee. Aside from the amenities, the views are spectacular from the balcony of the hotel and that's why you're in Sedona right?This Best Western is pricey but worth every penny.My now husband and I were wed in Sedona on June 3, 2013. Our parents, grandparents, and brothers joined us there for a wedding weekend vacation. Everyone stayed at the Best Western Arroyo Roble in all different types of rooms. We stayed in a North Signature Room and it was wonderful; beautiful view, assigned parking spot, and a fireplace. One of our families stayed in Standard Rooms and they were fine, certainly nothing to complain about considering the more affordable price  (their Red Rock View was great). However, we found that the best value was to book a Creekside Villa like the other of our families did. The villa had two bedrooms, washer/dryer, furnished kitchen, and living room with a sleeper couch. My grandparents and parents each had a private bedroom with their own bathroom upstairs. My brother slept on the couch downstairs and used the 1/2 bath located on the first floor. The villa's patio was a nice place to sit and relax. The price of the villa ended up being less than booking two rooms at the actual hotel and gave my brother his own space to sleep. Overall, this hotel was exactly what we wanted and we will definitely stay again when we visit. The complimentary breakfast, club house amenities, and location cannot be beat!This is an excellent hotel if you're planning on staying in Sedona. Donna and I spent four nights here and enjoyed it very much. We were planning on spending another night but due to the deep freeze hitting on Friday we decided to skip town before the beautiful snow turns into black ice. Since lots of people were bailing they let us check out early with no extra fees. Hotel is at the end of a very touristy part of town full of shops and restaurants. It was handy since we could just walk to a restaurant to eat and it was a short driving distance from what I considered the more enjoyable parts of town. The issue with this side of town are the time share salesmen everywhere. These parasites are worse than midway game carnies at the fair and really take away a lot of the charm of Sedona. They will literally yell at you if you don't stop in to hear their sales pitch and one followed us down the sidewalk! Make sure when you're walking to a restaurant or shop stay clear of anything saying ""tourist info"". Stick to the official visitor center unless you want to be called ""Brainless"" or ""stupid"" for not taking them up on their free vacation packages. Sedona is so strict on buildings blending in with the scenery and noise levels they really need to do something about these folks. The lobby of this hotel is beautiful with an always roaring fireplace and cushy leather seats. Since we were picked up from the lobby twice for tours it was nice and relaxing. Our room was fairly large with an extremely comfortable king sized bed, fridge, coffee maker, and private balcony facing the red rocks, specifically ""snoopy rock"". The room was spotless, every inch of it was so clean. Bathroom was tiny but comfortable with it's rain style shower head. Our only issue was the thin walls. We were next to the stairs and elevator and would hear folks talking while waiting for the elevator or people stomping down the stairs. Since it was snowing and very cold the heater was a must.... but the heater was so frickin loud it would wake us up every time it clicked on! Overall it's a great hotel with extremely friendly service. There was even a full hot breakfast served in the mornings with eggs, waffles, bacon, juices, fruits, cereals, etc. There is also a clubhouse which has heated pool, raquet ball court, tennis courts, steam room, and dry sauna.  Now that I'm familiar with Sedona I'd probably stay on the southern side of town and away from the time share leeches.I'm tempted to rate this place higher because of its views, but I can't because of its accessibility limitations.  If I ruled out the handicapped accessibility issues, I'd give this place another star or two.My dad is in a wheelchair, and he did just fine in an accessible room (2 queen beds), but the rest of the hotel was tough for us to get around.  Think steep inclines for parking, inescapable staircase if you want to swim, zero accommodation/parking at the workout facility, etc.  The hotel does have an elevator, and we were told that this is fairly unique for the area.The hotel has you pay a higher fee for mountain view versus ""sunset view"" (read: shop view).  We went on numerous drives and tours of the mountains, so we opted for the cheaper room, but if you're going for a romantic getaway, the incremental bump might be worthwhile.  We did not miss it at all.Breakfast and internet included in the room rate.  Breakfast (in a nearby building downhill) was good and varied a bit day to day--waffle station, eggs, swine, fruit, coffee, juice, etc.  The staff was fine.  No one ever opened a door while we were pushing my dad in a wheelchair, and the staff overall didn't meet the ""wow, everybody-is-so-much-friendlier-here-than-on-the-east-coast"" expectation our previous Arizona travels had set, but they were adequate.If you're choosing between this Best Western and the one further down the street, I'd choose this one.  I didn't visit the other one at all, but from our numerous drives, we felt this place has a marginally better location.  That said, if I return to Sedona, I'd stay somewhere else altogether.The room we wanted fell victim to lightening so we were moved into the main hotel.  One would be annoyed with this but BW took care of us by saving us 50%.  We still got a room with a view.  We also asked for a crib which was waiting for us.  We walked down to the creek and since it had been raining the past few days, the water was flowing fast and furious.  We were able to get some cute pictures with our child!  Overall, we had a great experience here.We didn't stay here, but the hubby and I attended a wedding here.  It was very pretty and they did a great job with the wedding.  The ceremony took place outside in the courtyard.  The reception took place on the second floor inside, with a very large outdoor patio overlooking the courtyard.  The next day we hung out with the hubby's brother and his wife (the bride and groom) to watch the Bears game.  The game didn't turn out so well, but their room was really nice with great patio!Even though we didn't stay here this hotel will always hold a special place in our hearts.  It was at this wedding that we became engaged!If you are looking for a luxurious hotel, don't be discouraged by the ""3 star"" rating or the Best Western name.  This is top notch property worthy of a 4 star rating in my opinion.  I stayed in one of their newly renovated suites and it was as nice if not nicer than any exclusive hotel I've stayed in.  Let's start with the breath taking setting.  The view from our ground floor unit over looked the beautiful and unique red mountains of Sedona.  The location of the hotel itself is perfectly set in the heart of uptown and is walking distance to dozens of shops and restaurants.  The room itself was amazing with a sleek contemporary feel and impeccably clean.  The jacuzzi tub, multiple sinks, and a walk in shower with overhead rain style head were just awesome.  When it comes time for breakfast, the included breakfast buffet is about as good as a free hotel breakfast will ever get.  I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised and delighted with my accommodations.  This is by far the nicest Best Western I've ever stayed in.  From here on out, this hotel will always be the standard by which I compare other ""3 star"" hotels and Best Westerns.  Next time I return to Sedona, this is where I will be staying.We stayed in the back condo area.  Our Condo was nice.  They were doing work on the parking lot which made parking a real problem by our unit.  Staff was really not helpful with this situation.  The condo was spacious and clean.  Beds were comfortable.  Towels were not very nice and bathrooms were laid out strange,  one was very small and hard to keep consistent hot water.  In our condo, all bedrooms were up some very narrow stairs so we left all our suitcases downstairs.  Staff was attentive and quick with repairs.  The breakfast is pretty good and fresh.  In walking distance to stores and restaurants.  Pool was nice and the kids loved the game room.","My boyfriend took me to Sedona for the first time this Valentine's day and it was incredible. We stayed at the BW Plus Arroyo Robles Hotel &amp; Creekside Villas (full name) and it was fabulous. First and foremost: let me tell you how fantastic the pillows are! So good in fact, I'm currently working on trying to buy some for my bed. I usually wake up with a stiff neck or back because my pillows suck but I slept so well here. The bed is great but the pillows are like heaven. Even my boyfriend liked them and he's super picky.The full free breakfast in the morning was really good, although I will say that I wasn't a fan of the potatoes. Something about them was too sweet. Possibly too much rosemary but the waffles were great and it was nice to have a got breakfast on a cold morning. The room was pretty standard for a hotel room. Good size, maybe bigger than most hotels I've stayed at. A nice little balcony that gives a great view of the red rocks.The indoor pool was a little disappointing. I was expecting something grander than what it was and the outdoor portion of the pool was closed because of it being February so the inside only part didn't seem big enough for more than one person to swim in. (the pool has a pass through that goes from the inside to outside). The rec center, where the pool is, is fun though. They have pool tables and ping pong and Foosball and all that other kind of stuff for entertainment. I think one of my favorite parts was the lobby having 24 hour hot chocolate and coffee. Coffee with REAL CREAMERS! Not the grainy generic creamer that most hotels give you. This was actually International Delight caramel and vanilla creamer. (I know that seems like a little thing but for someone who won't drink coffee without creamer, it's huge). The hot chocolate was really good too and helped defrost my fingers at night. Their location I think is both good and bad. It's in uptown around tons of shops so it's fantastic for shopping and walking around enjoying the views. However, we had to go down the road quite a bit (a past at least two roundabouts that drive me crazy) to get to the grocery store or to the restaurants we went to, like the Hillside grill and such. The look of the hotel is fabulous and it's much bigger than I expected. There's also a creek that runs through it (hint the name) and it was so relaxing to go sit on a porch swing sort of thing by the creek and the trees and just chill. Overall, I highly recommend it to those going to Sedona. It's a beautiful hotel with beautiful views and friendly staff.They can be expensive since they are right on the main ""tourist"" strip of Sedona, and right by Oak Creek (seriously, just a walk past the pool and you are in the creek - AMAZING) but here is a tip - even if they try to get you for a ton of money, just tell them you want a better deal.  Work them, ask what kind of discounts they can give you etc.  They tried to charge me 249 a night (standard I think) but after some wheeling and dealing with them I got it down to 169/night ... and for Sedona ... during Labor Day - that's a steal!  Just remember you can haggle them and work them down.  Tell them you will go to the ""other"" Best Western or something.  They have rooms they need to fill and want you there.  Trust me :-)A very solid value for the area! I wouldn't hesitant to recommend it to friends who want a comfortable base to explore the area &amp; aren't seeking a retreat/resort experience.Pluses:a) room:-standard hotel room with comfortable bed-fridge so you can get items from the grocery store-free wifi-great view from the balcony of rocks-facing rooms-reasonable prices for Sedona (about $170/night over Veterans' Day weekend before taxes)b) extras:-clubhouse with ping pong, air hockey, pool, some photocopied hiking maps, etc.-free breakfast (even you have a restricted diet, it's nice to sit down with tea and fruit, and the breakfast staff are very friendly)c) location:-walkable to restaurants/galleries and across the street from Harmony Park (public xylophones)-near the ""Y"" highway intersection so easy access to all parts of SedonaMinuses:a) general:-front desk staff a bit curt (for example: surprised me by grabbing my car keys when I said I didn't know my rental's license plate number, which is sometimes written on keys but wasn't in this case, and grabbing them was not appropriate)-a bit of a walk up stairs from the parking especially if transporting luggage (there is supposed to be temporary parking for unloading but it happened to be full when we arrived, though afterwards it was not full)b) during cold weather:-motel style hallways mean you have to go outside whenever you leave your room, and it's more cozy not to have to wear a coat to breakfast-you have to walk a way outside to get to the clubhouse so it's not ideal to run back &amp; forth to the hot tub in your swimsuitThis is really an interesting place to stay.  It's a combination quaint little motel and pseudo-resort.  My wife and I had a room in the motel part.  The price of the room was pretty high, so I expected some luxury, but the only thing luxurious about our room was the view.  It was spectacular.  We had a very thin balcony overlooking the red rock panaroma, which was a great place to sit and enjoy the ambiance.  Our room was small, probably about 20% smaller than a standard nice room.  There was one bed - a queen.  A king bed would not have fit and still have room for a desk or a chair.  The bathroom was a tile square with no dividers - half toilet area and half shower.  No sink.  The sink/vanity was outside of the bathroom, right by the bed, which could be a problem if you and your roommate keep different sleep hours.  Oh, the shower.  Rainforest head, with two horizontal sprays at strategic body areas.  Also a separate portable adjustable shower unit and a fold down seat.  Pretty much everything you could want in a shower.   Best Western has apparently partnered with a timeshare property next door/down the hill, and motel guests have full use of the timeshare clubhouse facilities, which is a really good selling point.  There's also a lot of property, playground, barbecue/picnic area, and 600 feet of Oak Creek running through the property.   It's too bad they couldn't have added a few of those square feet to our room.  Only negative about the clubhouse/recreation area is there is no food or beverage service at all.  There is, however, a complimentary breakfast in one of the adjacent buildings, and it was hot and excellent.  So, five stars for the view, the breakfast, and the shower (???).  If it were half the price I would have given it four stars, but the room was just too damn small to really be comfortable, especially if you were planning to stay for several days.  And if you want to have a drink by the pool you have to plan ahead.Clean rooms, friendly staff, beautiful views. Really enjoyed our stay!Only stayed one night but loved it! Comfy beds, great pool, awesome breakfast! Beautiful views from every floor. Steps from shoppes and restaurants. Will be back!Great location. Friendly, helpful staff. Rooms are clean. Views are amazing.  Breakfast is plentiful and the staff working the breakfast room keep things well stocked and tidy.  It is under construction and extremely noisy!!! Yikes. Don't plan on  peace and quiet.For a Best Western, this hotel was pretty nice. The views from our hotel room were awesome. The beds weren't totally comfortable but that's expected. It's right on the tourist strip so it's in walking distance of a ton of stuff. The service was nice, my boyfriend and I wanted to stay an extra night and when we went to book it, they gave us a deal.Great location in up town Sedona, stayed in a creek side villa, clean, well serviced spacious accommodation, kids loved the club house and pool, both really added to the break.  Breakfast, included, was fresh with plenty of choice, great service, never too busy.  We would definitely recommend it! Do a pink jeep tour!Best Western has really stepped up lately and it shows in this little hotel.  It's a bargain with free breakfast.  I felt safe, had wi-fi, anything I wanted to watch on TV, great beds!  Clean, non-smoking rooms and some will accept your little furry friends too.  Great location and we were happy with our stay.  We also went to Scottsdale AZ and stayed in a Best Western and I have absolutely no complaints.  Also had wi-fi in every room and in the main lobby several computers with printer.  woo-hoo.The best Best Western ever.  Great location - central &amp; with a view of the creek &amp; red rocks.  Not so cheap - $245, weekend nite.  But clean &amp; roomie.  Big deep bathtub.  Comfy bed.  And free internet access!  You know what?  This place doesn't nickel &amp; dime you!  The ethernet cable was delivered to my room for free - unlike Portola Inn in Monterey that charge you $5 to buy the eternet cable so you can connect to internet at $10!  Also, if you forget stuff like tooth brush, tampons, etc., they'll give them to you for free....  OMG!  What a concept.   Free breakfast was good!  Sausage patties, eggs, make your own waffles, cereal.  Really good for kids.We climbed Bell Tower rock &amp; it was stupendous!We put the ""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign on our door and every day of a 7 day stay that we shortened to a 6 day stay we were called by housekeeping asking if we needed towels.  The ultimate irritation was being awakened on our 2nd to last day by housekeeping at our door trying to give us 2 wash cloths.  We hadn't asked for any wash cloths. When I said we didn't want any the housekeeper, then, wasn't sure if it was our room who'd asked for them.  Clearly, it was not.  We're checking out early because of it and I talked with staff at the desk about it.  I let them know that do not disturb really meant do not disturb.We had a great five nights in a standard room with a view of the red rocks. It was better than the views from the colocated Arroyo Roble Resort - they have more plush, spacious accommodations but the views of the mountains are nowhere as spectacular as the much cheaper standard rooms. The hotel was very helpful in giving advice and solving special needs. The breakfast buffet is a definite step up from the standard complementary ones provided at similar hotels.stayed with family, nice hotel wish I would have done the villas but still very pleased with valueWonderful, clean hotel for Best Western.  The most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.  And I'm not kidding.  Towels are ivory colored, soft and thick, coffee pot in the room.  Service was great and a complimentary HOT breakfast in the morning.  Rate was only about $100 for a week night and it's right in the heart of the touristy part of Sedona.  Would highly recommend staying here.Look, I don't stay in a lot of Best Westerns (or such similar hotels), but I was on a budget conscious men's weekend.  This does the trick.  Their is a view, which anywhere else in the world would be considered amazing.  But for Sedona it is average.  But really, you are going to get viewed out in Sedona after a couple days.  Their is a balcony, but I can't imagine hanging out on it.  It was just kind of sparse.  Their is a very good pool (two I think).  And it is heated.  It was downright cold, and some crumb muncher was enjoying himself mightily.  If you also don't often stay at Best Westerns, know this: the front door opens to and outside hallway and therefore to parking lot and road sounds in the morning.  It wasn't hugely loud, but it was not a hugely busy time of year.  This is an OK choice.  And the price is right.  Oh yes, no mini bar but a mini fridge... Go down to the Circle C and get a six pack to stock in the room.",,,"['trip', 'west', 'purchased', 'express', 'deal', 'night', 'long', 'time', 'since', 'best', 'western', 'found', 'best', 'western',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sedona-real-inn-sedona,Sedona Real Inn,4.0,$$,90,"Read the reviews on this place and decided to take a risk on this one.  I know a reviewer said it was far from the main drag, but I like to avoid congestion at all cost as I like to find parking and not walk a mile to my room if I decide to go out for dinner and come back after 9pm.  I truly think this is the best value in town, and for the following reasons.  1.  Can you say soft water???  I believe these guys may have the only soft water system in the area.  Coming from Cali, the dry air works wonders on my skin (not positive), so it's great to have soft water.  2.  The showers are solid granite with glass sliding doors.  The maids clean this room so well each day, one one of the days, I was reaching for some liquid soap in the shower that I brought and jammed my finger into the glass shower as it was so clean, I didn't even notice it... OUCH!!!!!    Fire Places in the room, DVD players in the rooms for each tv, immediate hot water (no warm up process), and full breakfast included.  I mean eggs, sausage, a waffle maker, etc...  Can't believe they do this for the price of the room.  Do these guys make money???  But lastly, The Staff are amazing at this place.  Very warm and they make you feel like family.  Part of their own.  If you like quiet, great service, but most importantly most bang for your buck, this is the place... well it was for me.This place was fantastic for the basic room I paid for.   I live on a budget and this was one of the best places I have stayed at for what I paid.  Continental breakfast was much more with egg choices, oatmeal, waffles, cereal, bagels, fruit (fresh) and more.  The microwave and fridge were great and it was not with the toilet; near the sink but I have no concerns with the location.  They have a great clock that has different phone charger options and a couple of USB outlets, it came in handy. The walls are thin - thankfully we did not have kids next to us.  The strong jets were needed after a four hour hike but the hot tub was nice and hot.   GoodCleanFriendly staffFriendly/helpful concierge Awesome breakfastAC Lots of towels in roomGrounds cleanRooms very cleanClean shower/tubGood water pressure from showerFree parking WeakSpa jetsThin wallsWe, a family of 5, stayed 1 week at the Sedona Real, it was definitely more than expected! It's not luxurious but it's extremely clean and comfortable for the price. I was in a ground floor (2nd floor should have a nice view of the rocks) suite with 2 queens, 1 queen sofa, fireplace, balcony, refrigerator, microwave, TV, DVD, tile floor and balcony. There were little amenities that made  the room more enjoyable like double sink, spacious room even with 3 queen beds, and huge trash outside the room, which made it easy to unload our bigger trash. I particularly enjoyed to have the room cleaned early! This is a must for us when on vacation. The ladies did an awesome job refilling the shampoo and towels abundantly. Well deserved tip! Very knowledgeable concierge, plenty of choices for breakfast. Oh, and they are really pet friendly! My little dog got a leash, a few cookies and a collapsible water bowl during check-in, which was really handy during our outings during extreme heat. Cons:The pool is small and full of children on the weekends, but they were having fun! It was only ours during the week.Spa is not really bubbly or with strong jets but still, did the job. It would be nice to have a bigger pool since it's so hot! And.... the AC, it's a little noisy and kept going on and off during the night so we'd wake up hot then it'd come on again, like magic. We found out a button to have the fan running continuously, it got better then.I'd definitely stay there again and recommend it!Ideal if you are traveling with your furry friend.  Gifts for the pup at check in, very large fenced in grassy area to walk the dog, bbq grill, picnic tables.  Our ground floor suite was clean, huge and comfortable.  Great location...just on the edge of town coming in from Phoenix.  Close to trail heads.  Great restaurants nearby.  Concierge and staff courteous and helpful.  Hot breakfast.  Would definitely stay here again.This hotel was okay, nothing fancy, nothing bad, something basic and priced right for what's it's worth.  I was in town for the day and stayed here one night.Ken who checked me in was very nice, gave me information on the town, where to get dinner and walked outside to show me where the building was that I'd be staying in.Hotel is clean, kind of needs a remodel, the shower was a little odd, I'm thinking I was maybe in a handicapped room as there was a bench in the shower stall.It was one of the cheaper hotels in the area in the category above the motels, had a comfy bed, a desk, coffee in the room, a TV and a fitness center. They also include free breakfast.  I would say it's a 3 star but I'm going to give it 4 stars as I left my jacket in their fitness room, they found it and are in the process of mailing it back to me which shows they have great customer service!Very EXCELLENT experience with Sedona Real! Decided to have a nice weekend with the Mrs this weekend. Took a chance on this hotel and I'm very happy that I did.Check in was very easy and the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable on local restaurants and points of interest in the area. The room was immaculate. Looked like a small apartment. One tv above the fireplace with a nice couch. Another tv in front of the bed so you can catch a program while in comfort. Very nice wet bar with sink and mini fridge. The shower and bathroom were very well kept and spacious. All in all, this was an awesome place to stay in sedona.Very great experience with Sedona Real and I for sure will be returning. Awesome views too!!! Go check them out!!!Great location. Included tasty breakfast. Friendly staff. Stayed 2 nights and would return.  Close to most trails and shopping. Concierge service. Most importantly, very clean. Drawback: no safe in room.Excellent experience, clean and quite. The pool and hot tub were a pleasant surprise. First hot that didn't smell like chlorine. It was so clean you can see the bottom clearly.This is actually a nice looking place with a small river that drowns out some noise.  However I picked a bad day to stay here, because a bunch of noisy ATVers just landed here shouting to each other all night (I'm told there are about 40 of them spread out in the compound).   Honestly couldn't they be considerate to other guests and tell them to keep the noise down?  Guess I'm not getting any sleep tonight.  I should have stayed at the cheap crappy motel from last week.The good thing is the free wifi works, that's how I'm typing this review.This place is a bargain considering we came during holiday season and pretty much every single hotel was booked to the max. The room we booked is suite style with two full size beds and one pull out. The setup is a little strange with the sink of the bathroom separated and located at the entrance. The toilet and shower are in a separate room across from the sinks.Pros:- Free WiFi throughout the entire property- Small Fitness Facility - This closes at 10pm, but technically you have access 24/7 and can workout if you're quiet.- Free Hot Chocolate and Tea in the Lobby- DVD rentals - the room comes with a DVD player. You can rent a movie and get hot chocolate and microwave popcorn all for only $2.19!- Hairdryer- Lots of towels and pillows- Decent Continental Breakfast - They serve your typical eggs, sausages, make your own waffles, muffins, cereal, oatmeal, bagels, toast, coffee, juice, etc. No bacon though.- Good location to get to most places in Sedona (with a car of course)- Knowledgeable and helpful conciergeCons:- They only gave us 1 bar of soup for 5 people- Breakfast gets really crowded and it's hard to find tables- Pull out bed is uncomfortable, but they usually are- Somewhat strange setup of roomsOverall, very clean and quaint. I really liked the cozy inn feel to it.Nice place,  but not quite as fancy as the pics showed for the price.  Still a nice stop-over for us after a long road trip.  Wish we would've stayed longer to enjoy hiking.  The breakfast buffet was good, but one suggestion...get new coffee. My mom and I have 2 very different tastes in coffee and both agreed the coffee did not have very good flavor. I know there are a lot of coffee machines out there and I've never heard of that kind,  but it might be time for a change.  The coffee in the room was actually better.  Oh, I can't forget the best part...the desk employees were very friendly/easy-going.  The breakfast attendant was also very helpful when I asked for a plain banana for my very picky father who doesn't do most breakfast foods.Wonderful staff, beautiful room!!! The room was very clean the breakfast buffet was really good. My husband and I were very pleased and would recommend this place to any one and will definitely come back!This place is awesome.... Very clean... Best customer service we've had this trip... Great breakfast... Large, spacious room.... Lots of towels... Would recommend this place to friends and will stay here next time I'm in Sedona!Very nice place to stay if you have a pet.  We got an online deal for $159 a night for the suite.  It was nice and large with a tile floor for our pet. Lots of pets there.  We were in Sedona Nov 30th and the weather was perfect for hiking.  There are a lot of the hiking trails only a couple mile drive from this hotel. We hiked Devils Bridge, great first hike and awesome views. The free breakfast was typical and OK but the room was always packed and we did a lot of standing and waiting.  The next day we just went out to eat.   But that was the only lil bump in the road.Oh and the room fire place was on all the time.  Nice.Was not a fan of this hotel. We stay in Sedona a lot and have frequented several local hotels and B&amp;B's. Compared to others it did not live up to the price. We will not be staying here again. If you are a mountain biker check out other hotels. Hauling bikes up and down stairs sucks..The Good:CleanFriendly staffLocationFree breakfastThe Bad:Small roomFridge and microwave in the bathroomNoisy AC / heaterThe bedThe shower head The towelsThin wallsPriceBeautiful place. Very impressed with the curtesy of the employees. The free breakfast is very good - better than most and way better than bagels and doughnuts. The concierge worked for over an hour to try to book my wife and daughters some spa time in Sedona. Thanks Tonya!I give this beautiful place a 5 .. BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!. room , restroom was clean and helpful house cleaning women. Thanks to BRIAN AND KEN .. the gift for our 1 year wedding anniversary was awesome ( upgraded to a king suite as a gift ;) !!!) I can't wait to return .. thanks for making this trip the best ever!!!!!!God bless  Mrs.and Mr. CarsonGreat service. The staff was so friendly. We had never been to Sedona before and they mapped out our entire trip for us! We had a great time. Pool is refreshing, rooms are clean and spacey. Our room had a fridge, microwave, hair dryer, free wifi, DVD player, flat screen and a very comfy bed. The free complimentary breakfast is from 7-10am and it was delicious. The location is also perfect being within 15 minutes of all the state parks for hiking or family day trips. Overall, great experience. We will definitely stay there again next time!Nice rooms! the staff/concierge were very friendly and helpful. They guided us to an amazing hike that fit exactly what we were looking for. The continental breakfast was okay, but better than nothing! The rooms were very clean. they also have a nice hot tub and pool- very wonderful as it was so hot out! Wish the rooms were equipped with safes, but they do offer access to lock boxes behind the front desk counter.Nice, clean hotel, reasonable rates, and convenient location with easy access to the heart of Sedona! This was the designated hotel for my friend's wedding two years ago.Nice array of breakfast items in the morning, which was a great cure for the morning after hangover. Don't judge, I was the Maid of Honor for my wigged-out, but well meaning Bride BFF! The only thing I'd knock a star off for was the pillows at this place were rock hard. My own fault for forgetting our pillows down in Phoenix, but don't think my Dude slept a wink that weekend.Will definitely come back next time we're in Sedona.","The housekeeping staff was excellent.  When we checked in the room we were given was not what we had paid and reserved for. We reserved a king suite with a balcony. We we forced to take a roon with 2 queen beds and no balcony.  My husband and I always stay in a king suite and get a balcony if the hotel offers it. We would never of reserved a room with 2 queen beds. The queen bed we slept on was very uncomfortable. we will never stay at this hotel again because management did nothing to solve the fact that they gave us the wrong room.Located in uptown Sedona, the place is near a lot of red rock formations hence hiking and biking trails too. They serve good complimentary continental breakfast. I didn't like the coffee though it tastes stale and bland eventhough it's from a coffee machine. I like my coffee strong! The roomWe got is a studio type king size bed. The room is newer than Bell RockInn but lack some amenities that you may want if you want to stay a long time. Also it is weird that the fridge, coffee maker and microwave is in the bathroom. The tv was not working and hair dryer not working. I don't think I'm booking here againBeautiful property away from the chaos, but still close enough to anything and everything. Clean rooms with comfy beds, friendly staff, and delicious breakfast buffet. Our room had a fireplace (and it actually gives off heat!) and was pretty quiet throughout the morning and night.This place was so convenient. Huge breakfast, laundry facilities, microwave, fridge, fire place, patio with a gorgeous view. There is even a little park with a fire pit and grounds to walk your pets. They have their own concierge everyday and the staff is very helpful and friendly. It is also located very close to everything. For the price you can't get any better. I will be staying here everytime I visit sedona!Dude, come on? What some people write about this hotel is comical. You get what you pay for. In Sedona, unfortunately, not even the Super 8 is cheap (over $100 dollars usually). So, I paid about 160 a night for this place. There is a hot breakfast and a fridge and microwave in every room. You go to Sedona for the Red Rocks and all of the amazing sites, not for the hotel. Don't be scared away by the one star reviews, especially the pillow review. Who writes an entire paragraph about a pillow? Not anyone I want to go to Cathedral Rock with.Before I get into the cons, I'll note that the staff was extremely helpful, courteous, friendly and offered good concierge-type advice (which is why I'm giving the extra star).Booked an expedia deal for any room available (assumed this meant either a basic double queen or king room).  Did not expect to be stuck with a handicap room where there is a vinyl bench in the shower with detachable flimsy showerhead only going up to top of my neck, big empty bathroom at the cost of a smaller tiny bedroom and fridge mounted on top of desk that was small to begin with.  No space in room for even a small seat.  Expedia room description misleading (which I assumed the hotel signed off on).  Staff did try to move me but hotel was sold out.Aside from issues specific to handicap room, the room generally smelt dank/musty, poor air circulation, cramped and the refrigerator froze everything we put in it.  Rooms definitely need an update.Pictures online of the ""dog park"" and fire pit area are misleading (does not look like that at all and is small).  Pool area is fine (but also small).Included breakfast everyday was good with eggs and such.In a decent location on edge of Sedona near some of the less popular hikes.  The main part of town and most of the hikes are about 10 minutes away.  Good thing is that on the way to that part of town, you pass supermarkets, bunch of restaurants, etc.Would consider this place a slight upgrade over a Super 8 or budget motel but definitely below a Best Western.Stayed July 20, 21, 22 2015. Enjoyed my stay. Booked through hotel tonight and then upgraded for a very reasonable fee to a king suite. The bed was extremely comfortable, there were plenty of towels provided, and the suite was very spacious. The rooms were clean and everything was in good working order. The Inn was very quiet. The location on the west end of town is convenient to the western canyons and hiking areas, and not in the middle of the noisy tourist district. The only small complaints I had were the loud air conditioning unit in the bedroom, and the breakfast was rather mundane. The solution to the AC was to run the smaller unit in the living room area and shut the large unit by the bed off at night. The solution for breakfast was to eat down the street at Chocola-tree. I used the pool and spa each morning, and found them to be clean and nicely laid out. This hotel offers a discount for repeat customers, and there is the opportunity to check a box to provide a small donation for each night you stay to raise money for developing local mountain bike trails around Sedona. I will definitely consider staying there on my next visit.Location is ok. motel type of rooms with bed right in front of door, with parking in front of rooms.Small Room in second floor without any views. AC is very loud above the window. Bed is an inexpensive version of memory foam. very uncomfortable.Pictures on website are misleading. Would try many other places before staying here again.We enjoyed our 3 night stay here. We had a room with 2 queen beds. It was plenty big for a family of 3. I love how they provide a continental breakfast (eggs, cheese, sausage, bagels, muffins, juices, coffee, and a waffle station). The concierge was super helpful as we had to get creative with activities for our 5 yr old since we were snowed in. We wish we could go hiking but unfortunately it's too snowy. It's in walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants (not the main strip downtown). We had a beautiful view of the red rocks outside our room. The electric fire place was awesome to use to warm us up after playing in the snow! There's laundry on site which is very convenient. We'll stay here again as we must return to Sedona so we can hike those beautiful trails!!Booked a night here at the last-minute on Hotwire. I think it was about $160, which, once I saw the place, I thought was absurd. It tries to be nicer than it really is. Yes, it has a pool (I was looking forward to this until I saw it was crawling with bratty kids, so I opted out) and is situated in such a way that there are multiple buildings that you drive to, which might make it feel more like a resort. But I've stayed at plenty of Hyatts and DoubleTrees for cheaper with nicer rooms. The rooms are dated-looking but clean. My door wouldn't deadbolt unless I slammed my body against it. And at first I thought the toilet wouldn't flush - until I turned it so hard I thought it would break off (it probably will next time someone stays there). The desk staff left something to be desired. When I arrived, two people were at the desk and one was helping a confused woman who was taking forever. The other didn't say anything like ""We'll be right with you"" or anything until I'd been standing there for a good five minutes wondering what the issue was. When I got to the desk, someone behind me asked the staff where there was a good place to get ice cream nearby, and the desk clerk said there wasn't anywhere, only at the grocery store. I later looked on my phone to see if there was a place nearby, and sure enough there was about five places, one of which I went to. You'd figure the staff gets asked questions like this a lot, and to not know seemed pretty unprofessional. In the morning at checkout, the clerk didn't smile or seem friendly at all. The breakfast looked unremarkable, so I spent $5 on a bagel down the street.The room is less than I expected but the friendly service made up for shortcomings in the room.  Geoff F's review pretty much nails it, it has the vibe of 1980s motel - clean and maintained but not updated.  Pricewise, it is no bargain but I think room rates throughout Sedona are pretty steep due to the proximity to the red rocks and other natural wonders.  Breakfast included with room is slightly above average.  Grounds and gardens are nice.Pretty good location, affordable, nice rooms, and extremely friendly staff. We booked very last minute as the local Days Inn had no one at their front desk for 30 minutes to check us in. We cancelled that reservation and read good reviews on AAA about Sedona Real. Those reviews were correct! The concierge gave us good tips of what to do in Sedona and when we checked in Kenneth suggested a delicious restaurant down the road. Would recommend to anyone--especially if you plan an extended stay in Sedona.Never being to Sedona before, my friends and I really had no idea what to expect in a hotel in the area.  We got a great deal (2 queen beds and a sleeper sofa, a fireplace, and a balcony)- they even have a Yelp check-in bonus too!  WiFi is free, and so is breakfast- its decent enough to get you on the road!Check-in was easy, and parking is free.  When we got to our room, it was spacious and clean; however the fridge wasn't working.  We called and they sent us a carpenter.  And then we met Dean- he seems to be the go-to guy around this place- like the hotel knight in shining armor.  He was friendly friendly and a bad ass in general.  Make sure you say hi to him if you see him (he has also been renovating the rooms there- great job!).This place isn't a Ritz by any means, but it is comfortable and affordable, and the people are nice.  There is even a pool!  Did I forget to mention its a block from the Jeep rental place I went to?  Awesome!Quick summary: A clean version of a low end motel, with typically poor noise isolation, room finishes, and overpricing of many Sedona hotels.The bad: As other reviewers note, the pillows are hard. Really hard. We're talking sandbags. Maybe they're stockpiled here by the city in case area creeks flood. We asked for softer pillows, which the staff happily announced would be delivered while we were out for a day trip. More pillows were delivered -- more of the same sandbags. ""We asked for softer pillows,"" we cried, our necks and shoulders begging for relief from the previous night. ""That's all we have,"" we were told after a second call. Why get our hopes up? Why charge nearly $300 for a room with WEAPONS GRADE PILLOWS?Yes, that's a paragraph dedicated to pillows, but you'll be sleeping a lot in this town since it shuts down early. The pillows alone are worth a lost star.Other problems: nearly 0 room lighting (see photo of sign proclaiming their poor quality in exchange for being ""Green"" -- we simply think the proprietor is cheap!). No view at all (our patio looked at some large storage shed and a tree in a dog park). At least put some landscaping in to hide this, folks! No staff between midnight and 6 am -- not generally a problem, unless it turns out your Green toilet suffers from water pressure so low you'll swear it clogs simply from water itself. Maybe bring your own plunger?Want a good shower after a dusty day outdoors? Nope. Enjoy the Green (that means ""cheap"", once again) shower head with what can't be more than 1 gallon per minute flow. You couldn't clean a coffee mug with that thing! Plan on Green 30 minute showers. The towel awaiting you after is child-size at best, and also doubles as 100 grit sandpaper. Which is better than the hand towels that have to be 50 grit and actually took paint off the wall! (Yes, we tried out of curiosity. Yes, the paint was also cheap.)Our building seemed to have a bonus feature: an earthquake simulator. That's right, every time the guests next door closed their door (they all slam -- hard) the entire wall supporting the bed violently heaved. I dreamed multiple times of earthquakes collapsing the building onto my neck (between the wall shaking and the pillows, it seemed real at the time).We didn't particularly care, but the rooms don't even have HD channels on their Best Buy/Insignia TVs. The internet access is also painfully slow.Don't plan on walking anywhere from here either. It's pretty much the farthest hotel away from town.The air conditioning worked but had to have been diesel-powered. I've never heard a louder in-room unit, anywhere. The floor shakes from it!The good: high ceilings. Relatively clean. Relatively large room. Friendly if unprepared staff. Relatively close parking to most rooms (and there seemed to be enough spaces, though I wouldn't park a large truck or RV here).We gambled trying to stay here due to our usual spots being booked, but it wasn't a pleasant experience.We live in San Diego and had my Mother and Sister- In-Law visiting from NJ &amp; PA. We decided that we wanted to expose them to the rugged beauty of Sedona's red rock country. My wife &amp; I enjoy the freedom &amp; versatility of traveling in our Class C motor home. However, we felt that my  Mother-In-Law &amp; Sister-In-Law would be more comfortable in a hotel room. By chance we stumbled upon the Sedona Real Inn &amp; Suites. Two of the hotel's staff, Jake &amp; Todd, were stellar in their friendliness, assistance &amp; recommendations. We booked the room for our guests and were allowed to park our RV in the parking lot. The reserved RV parking spot in immediately adjacent to one of the most beautiful and well maintained dog parks I have ever seen. As our two little furry four legged children were in heaven romping on the lush grass, we were too. With one exception, a female working the front desk at our check-in, the staff has been nothing but amazing. They have gone out of their way to make us feel welcome and address any needs that have arisen. We will be back. Jake and Todd, thank you. In our eyes, you guys are Rockstars!Can't complain about my stay here. Great location, good breakfast and a very friendly staff. Not only do they offer pet-friendly rooms, they have a park for their guests complete with dog waste stations. My only complaint were the pillows on the bed. A little firm for my taste. But I would stay here again.This would not be my choice for future accommodations in Sedona.  Pros: the park next door is nice, with easy gated access from the parking lot.   Great if you travel with a pet.  The whirlpool suite was large and clean with a nice sized spa in the room and a toasty fireplace.  The room was clean and lots of towels- I always appreciate that.  The bed was also very comfortable.Those were my pros but unfortunately, I had an overall uncomfortable stay for a few reasons:When I arrived, my reservation had been canceled for some reason and I was told the only room they had left was the whirlpool super suite about $150 more per night for the week; more than double the rate of my initial reservation.  This was a surprise, but I kept a smile on my face and said that would be ok- Afterall, I'm always open to a nice suite.  Check-in was not overly welcoming and it felt a bit odd that the desk clerk asked me multiple times if I would be having an extra person in the room and explained the ""penalty"" repeatedly- it was obvious he didn't believe I was traveling alone. Come on now surly hotel guy-  some people do travel alone and aren't trying to save $15 by hiding their spouse in the trunk.Since I was at a seminar all day I opted not to have my room serviced for the first two days.  Both days I returned to coldly written notices taped to my door telling me my room would need to be ""inspected for my safety.""  I don't believe I've ever stayed at a hotel the required mandatory room inspections before.  Classy, very classy.  There's a small self serve breakfast included in the rate- it was not edible and the juice was actually rancid.  Bland egg beaters with bad grocery store salsa, cereal with warm milk or stale muffins and coffee are the options.The fitness center is an empty guest room with a few pieces of equipment.  Nothing wrong with that but if you'd prefer, you may want to bring appropriate clothing and head outdoors.  There are a number of really great trails nearby for hiking.I've stayed here twice now (about 4 years apart)  and had a wonderful experience each time.The first time was with my Siberian Husky, two teenage girls, my mom and I in one room, and my cousin and her husband in another. We were all happy with the grounds, how clean and well appointed the rooms were, the quality and offerings of the breakfast and the good rates. Last weekend was with my sister. I opted to book us the delux suite - so I could sneak out and smoke without waking her and we could both have some privacy. WOW. The room was huge - and probably overkill for just two of us.The concierge was wonderful, checking in and out was quick and easy, I was once again impressed with how clean and well appointed the room was, plenty of selections at breakfast (fruit and yogurt, oatmeal, various dry cereal, bread and bagels, waffle maker, sausage and scrambled eggs as well as juices and coffee), and once again - was impressed with the value. For the rate paid, I would have not expected it to be as nice as it was.Good location, easy access and staff eager to help and please.This will definitely remain my lodging of choice in Sedona.Stayed there this weekend for business, and thought my room was quite nice. Enjoyed just kicking back when I wasn't knee deep in paperwork and watching a little TV and just taking a relaxing nap. Didn't really eat much at the all you can eat breakfast buffet as they didn't have breakfast fare that I personally prefer, but everything I did have was good. If I had to make a suggestion, it would only be that the coffee they serve in the room (packets that make one cup) need to be switched out to something much more flavorful. My coffee in the room both mornings was extremely weak and flavorless. Had to go to the buffett to get decent coffee. Other than that, nice clean place, quiet for the most part, and when I go back up to Sedona next time on pleasure, I will probably stay there.Cannot get a better concierge! Debbie helped us navigate through Sedona, book our Pink Jeep Tour, and recommended awesome restaurants. After the closure of all National Parks/Monuments she helped make our trip a blast. Also, the hotel is clean and nice. The morning breakfast was good. Definitely go for the fresh bagels and muffins. They are from the local bakery.","We were looking for a place to stay in Sedona on the busy Cinco de Mayo weekend.  Several higher-cost nationally branded hotels were already full so we tried Sedona Real Inn.  What a wonderful find.The level of service and attention was first-rate, unlike the ""faux"" luxury services provided in many of the pricier hotels.  Their concierge desk was attentive and helpful, as was the front desk staff.  They are set up as a high-end motel with a nice pool and spa.  The rooms are clean and simple but attractive without too many frills - perfect for Sedona where we want to spend most of the time out of the room.  The pool and spa area is basic but very comfortable and available from 7am to 10pm.Speedy Wifi was free and the room had a refrigerator where we could put our drinks instead of it being filled with $14 miniatures of Scotch and $6 Snickers bars like so many hotels do now.  There is an attractive and roomy park/dog park in the rear of the parking area; next trip I'll bring the dog.This was a great pick for a Sedona get away.  It's tough to choose a hotel online without previous experience in a city, yelp really helped out with this one.  Nice sized rooms, very clean -- all the comforts we needed for a five night stay.  A couple miles from the congested 'uptown Sedona'. The location was perfect and access to great restaurants.   The included breakfast was a surprise and a real bonus... Saves big on an extended stay.Loved this place.  The staff was awesome, and accommodating, and the rooms were very big and comfortable.  The pool was great, too!!We plan to stay here again o our next trip to Sedona.I stayed at this hotel and was very pleased with the room, service and overall experience. I had a room overlooking the pool area and only seemed a bit loud during the daytime, when I was out so it did not matter much. I would stay here again if in the area. Lot's of nice shops close to it and it is far less expensive than some of the other local hotels.Good hotel, reasonable cost, really nice staff, a good experience and a good value.This is like a Hampton Inn but with older buildings and decor. Sedona Real was neat and clean.  I liked the breakfast, altho the layout of the food stations leads to a lot of congestion when it's busy.  The concierge (Debbie) was very knowledgeable and helpful.  We had one of the larger rooms (a suite) and it was really big and comfortable.  Our only complaint was the noisy AC unit, but that is typical in this price range.This is a gem in Sedona. Our room was meticulously clean, large and upscale with two toned walls, expensive furniture and elegant decor. They had the best most comfortable hotel mattress I've ever slept in. Their pillows were perfect for proper neck alignment. We had the a/c on constantly due to the heat and it definitely kept us cool. This place is inexpensive for what you get. It is a few miles away from the downtown part of Sedona so it's secluded. Highly recommended!3d/2n here. We were sent to room 613 (2 queen beds). We got a discount (mentioning yelp) and ended up paying $160/night (+tax) for the room, which was on the cheaper end of other hotel prices in the area. Sadly, we got what we paid for. The room was very tiny and motel style. I was super surprised because the night prior we came from La Quinta in Prescott which was $90 a night and weren't expecting much because we were just sleeping there, and that room put this to shame big time! So, we decided to call the front desk and asked how much would it be to upgrade to a bigger room, perhaps the one with a jacuzzi in it that I saw online. I spoke with a lady who's name started with a 'T', I think Theresa..? She said it would be $85 more a night. I asked if she could cut a deal and she said ok she could go to $60 more a night but that's the lowest because she knows she could sell it for higher. Ugh..ok. Thanks...? So first she offered to let me see the room since it's only a king and we had a baby and 4 yr old. So I went with her. The room was much more open and had a nice looking jacuzzi in it. I told her we would definitely keep it. So we switched to room 111. It was already late so we watched a movie and passed out. Next morning I opened the cupboards under the sink to find a fridge full of prior tenants old food, a bug, and a trash full to the rim. I was disgusted by it all, but especially the bug. It was a tiny bug, but still why is there a bug in the fridge?!!  So, when we went to have breakfast at the hotel (which is included), I talked to the front desk supervisor 'Ram'. I showed him pictures of the fridge (old food and bug) and the trash. He was apologetic, assured me that wasn't how they run their hotel, and told me he would contact housekeeping then call me in my room. Not long later he called me, saying housekeeping is detailed oriented and they don't know what happened but would be in to clean the room entirely and also would comp our upgrade difference ($60) for the night. I told him it was much appreciated, I wasn't looking for a handout I just wanted it taken care of and for them to know for the future because when you get a suite you don't expect it to come with this. We ventured around Sedona all day, came back to the room and I opened the fridge and what do I see? The bug is still there and the fridge is still full of old food. The trash next to it was dumped and our bed made, so I know housekeeping did come. So I called the front desk, Ram was gone for the day and a female supervisor was there. I don't recall her name (she was an older lady with black hair). I politely told her the situation and that the fridge was still dirty, she was familiar because I guess they notated what was going on. She said she spoke to Theresa (the one who first showed me the room) and that there was no trash around. I told her that I told Ram that the room looked clean, it was in the cupboards that was dirty. Her tone made it sound like I was lying and I got highly offended. I asked her if she was accusing me of lying and she said no. She again repeated what Theresa told her. I asked her if Theresa said we looked in the cupboards when we went there and she said she wasn't sure but would clarify. I informed her that there wasn't anything to clarify because we didn't look in the cupboards, we just looked in the room. She offered to come clean it out herself, at first I told her no. I got off the phone and my bf and I were discussing everything and he was upset. He said he wanted them to come see the old food and bug in their, so I called her back and politely asked if she would come and clean it out. She came herself and had a completely different attitude and was polite. I was tired of dealing with all this, on what was supposed to be a relaxing vacation. That evening we decided to go in the jacuzzi.  We were wondering why actual bubbles (like soap) came out when we turned on the jets, and were grossed that our skin felt slimy, and I smelt mold when the jets turned on---well to our horror the jacuzzi emptied and I see all this black gunk in the bottom. You could blame us for being dirty or something, but 1) we showered for bed before deciding to get in the jacuzzi 2) this was not dirt, this was like mold and buildup. I was so disgusted, but after dealing with the situation prior I knew it was useless to mention it to them. They just get defensive and play the blame game. So we go to check and out the gentleman asked how our stay was and I chuckled and said not that great and Ram was next to  him and said he would take care of my check out. We talked about how when he left they still didn't clean the fridge out, he said he read the notes and felt so bad because he assured me it would be taken care of. He said he would comp both $60 upgrade fees. Very nice of him, but I'm sorry we can not recommend this place! I understand the initial oversight, but it wasn't taken care of, &amp; I was talked to like I was lying..not cool..Nice location and nice, clean rooms.  There are a lot of options at breakfast (including a waffle-maker) and they're all really good.  On a side note, the nighttime front desk attendant is hilarious.We decided to save money but made a big mistake.. You get what you pay for! The beds are way too hard, so uncomfortable, the older brunette lady at the front desk was rude and unfriendly. We asked her if we get a choice of which room and she looked at us like we were stupid for asking. She swiped our keys for the wrong room and we had to return back to the front desk to fix her mistake. We waited to go to the male employee there and he was actually friendly and apologized while fixing the issue. Only positive was the free breakfast. Will not ever return.Comfortable rooms, at a good price for Sedona, in a convenient location.  When we checked in, they upgraded our room at no charge to a very spacious suite, which included a fridge, microwave, and a countertop bar area.  There were 2 TVs, one in the ""lounge"" area with the sofa, and one in front of the bed.  The bed itself was nice and comfy with lots of feather pillows.  Breakfast is included, and includes hot food such as make-your-own waffles and scrambled eggs.  There is also toast, bagels, and muffins.  For drinks, there is hot coffee, and various juices such as cranberry, orange, and apple.  A very wide selection of breakfast items for free!  The quality is as you would expect, not the greatest, but hey, it's plentiful, and free!  The front desk staff was friendly and helpful.  I'll definitely be staying at the Sedona Real in the future!We were not expecting much for this hotel when we booked but we liked it!!You can tell hotel rooms are remodeled so inside is modern and very roomy.4 adults and 1 kid had plenty of room.Breakfast was not bad also. We will stay here again when we go to Sedona.decent last minute spot. tales of the crypt front desk worker freaked us out. asked for a king, and got two doubles. in-room A/C was great when working, but didn't kick on overnight which was obnoxious. also sounded like a jet engine taking off. in the plus column, free bfast from 7-10. Next time I'll book earlier and get a place worth the $$.The room was ok but it was overpriced.  We checked in without a problem but the receptionist ended up giving us the handicap room.  They never even asked if that was ok.  The problem with it was that the bathroom was huge and made the room small.  The shower handle wouldn't stay in place and the water kept on turning hot and cold.  I complained when checking out and the receptionists didn't seem to care.  I gave 1 star for the bed and 1 star for the breakfast.  I don't think I'll be going back.Nice big rooms! Breakfast time is quite crazy busy. Love that they allowed dogs.Our room was right by the back gate which backed onto the main road so it was noisy at times. Location was awesome - away from all the touristy stuff but close to all the good restaurants and hiking etcFriendly staff. Room was clean and smelled good. Stream outside the room covered up noises.   Nice pool and jacuzzi. Breakfast was not great. Coffee was bad.So we typed in Dog Hotels in Sedona.  Only a few popped up.  We called the hotels available and told them that we had two siberian huskies and that we were going to be here over the holidays.  The only one that could make accommodations was Sedona Real Inn.  So we went.Our Experience could not have been more positive. Service, We were greeted with a smile every time we entered lobby, ate breakfast or ran into the maid service.  Ammenities.  Our room had a fireplace, it was clean and had a refrigerator and very comfortable bed.Dog Park.  When we check in we received a two leashes and water bowls for our dogs.  We took them to the dog park that is behind the hotel.  This was not your fenced off dead zone...This was a fully manicured, landscaped and fully stocked with poop bags Dog Park.We love you guys and will be back.ThanksThey had a deal on Expedia, and the ratings and rooms advertised and shown looked pretty nice.  Once we got there, my husband and I were sadly disappointed.  The rooms were tiny, and the view and amenities were less than stellar.  We were not expecting something at this price to be like a Days Inn or Motel 6, but that is exactly what the rooms felt like.  The built in air conditioning unit was mounted right above the window, which was right above the bed and was so LOUD.  Some of the time we just turned off the air and sweltered in the heat, just so we could sleep without the noise.  Perhaps they have some nice rooms, but don't be fooled, clearly all of them aren't so nice.  The price you pay, even with the deal, is not worth it.  We would have spent much more time relaxing in the room, if it was more roomy and comfortable.  We thought of relaxing in the outside hot spa, but it looked to fit about 2 people.  Staff is nice enough, but not nice enough for us to come back here.  Very disappointing.Nice place.  Booked online based on some positive Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews and was not disappointed.The daily breakfast being included helps so you can get the day started right before heading out to see the beautiful scenery.Even better, the mentioned you get a 15% discount when you come back to stay again.We stayed in a 2 queen suite and it was very nicely appointed and comfortable with a fridge as well as a pullout in the couch if needed.We didn't use the concierge, but talking to some other guests, they indicated he was very helpful with suggestions for local activities.Great people. So friendly and amazing breakfast (included). Want a great a great waffle breakfast? Wake-up here. Want great service? Stay here. Want good pizza, walk across the street. Really great experience!What's not to like...huge rooms, free wi-fi, cable t.v., free breakfast, a decent pool and tons of stuff within a short drive. The hotel is very convenient to multiple hiking trail heads, restaurants, tour locations, etc. And the price is lower than what you'd pay in most other hotels in the area.","This is a great spot. Great up to date rooms. Our room overlooks the pool and great sedona red rocks. The price includes a generous breakfast- eggs, sausage, fruit, waffles, bagels, juice, cereal, yogurt. Great way to start the day.A great replacement when the Hyatt is full. :)Friendly staff, but don't expect to sleep. The walls are paper thin and all I heard all night was other guests. Not worth the time and effort to stay here.I've stayed here two times in the past 6 months and both times was pleased with the friendliness of the staff and cleanliness of the room.  I have never stayed in the standard room so can not comment on the size of it but the Jacuzzi suite was huge!  Not only did it have a fireplace and private patio but the tub worked very well and was a great way to relax after hiking.  The only negative about the Jacuzzi rooms is that they are all the road so sitting on the patio is not peaceful.     I was a little disappointed during my most recent stay is that neither of the two concierges were there.  The rest of the staff did their best to try to guide me with a few questions that I had.  The front desk staff, Brian, Daryl and Luke, and a woman who I am sorry I can not remember her name, were wonderful.  I have never felt an entire staff was so helpful and friendly.  Overall a great place to stay and convienient to hiking, shopping etc.My best friend and I took a road trip from SoCal to Arizona without any clue where we were going to stay when we arrived. We found the Sedona Real Inn on yelp and it was affordable so we decided to stay here. Upon arrival, we were very pleased with the overall look and feel to the hotel. It was very clean and inviting. The breakfast here is free and great! Take advantage of it. Overall it was a very satisfying experience. The staff is lively and very inviting. They were the icing on the cake! Thank you for an awesome stay with great staff and a clean environment!! Will definitely return here as well as recommend this hotel to anyone who's looking for a place to stay in Sedona. Thank you!Stayed here on our recent vacation. Very nice hotel at a reasonable price. The room we had was great as we had 5 people (3 adults and 2 kids) and between the 2 queen beds and the sleeper sofa it was very comfortable. The only real problem was the street noise as our room faced 89A. Put since we were up early for hiking and out most of the day it wasn't too bad. Plus, the view was worth putting up with some noise. The complimentary breakfast was the best. The staff was very helpful in pointing out some good hiking trails and on directions. I would definitely stay here again if I am back in Sedona.We came here primarily because they allow dogs, but would stay here even if we did not bring our dogs.  Check in was a pleasant experience and the employees were helpful.  The room had a fireplace and the area around the hotel is well maintained.  Breakfast comes with the room and is tasty although busy.  Great location walking distance from a few good bars and restaurants.Reserved a pet friendly room here this weekend. After approximately 30 minutes of being in our room, my sig other started having a major allergy attack, he is allergic to dogs. (our dog is hypoallergenic) We have stayed in pet friendly rooms previously with no issues. We let the front desk know. They were accommodating, gave us a full refund and found other pet friendly rooms available at other hotels! The room appeared clean, maybe the products they use aren't strong enough? Maybe the dog that was in the room prior? Not sure! Disappointed we couldn't stay.We loved staying here. It was clean, the staff was so friendly and helpful with what to do in and around town. The complimentary breakfast was delicious eggs, sausage, waffles, etc. Completely worth the money.We booked through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> as this was a short notice trip to Sedona.  We booked a 2-queen room for a decent price relative to all the other available places in Sedona.  Check-in was friendly, quick and informative.  We were a little disappointed in the size of the room.  2-queens  and is with a small duvet like couch.  The fridge is a mini-bar fridge and is located in the bathroom underneath the sink.  If you want a Coke, you will have to wait for the bathroom to get free.  The air conditioner is LOUD!  Luckily we came in October so it was needed infrequently, but it WILL wake you up.  Breakfast is included and was decent.  Eggs, sausages, cereal, bagels, juices etc.  One turn off was the massive Tip jar (old pickle jar) for the cook that makes your omelet to order.  Nice touch with the make to order, totally cheapened by the huge tip jar.  A few good restaurants are in the area (Yelp them), and it isn't too far from attractions.  Overall, I would look for other more spacious accommodations before I stayed here again.  I realize that I probably got the <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotel.com&amp;s=ca0318a6c5ca0df886d87a25575694b5522121f0584300bca238552cf615a0ab"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotel.com</a> room deal, but even so I think the Yelp check in deal here would have been a better value for the money.  If you blindfolded me and took it off once I was in the room, I would have told you I was in a Motel 6.  Once you walk outside and see the beautiful scenery of Sedona, you realize that you will have to pay a little more for that room.My family and I recently stayed here on vacation. The hotel was very nice, clean and comfortable. The hotel staff are friendly and willing to recommend restaurants and activities (which is what you should do, lots of the ""tourist info centres"" in Sedona are actually timeshare traps). They have a delicious hot breakfast menu every morning which includes scrambled eggs and waffles, and it's all free. The Sedona Real is also in close proximity to gorgeous red rock mountains which are iconic to Arizona's landscape. If you want to go to Sedona, stay here!I would like to give this hotel a 2.5 star rating, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and making it a 3 for lack of the option.PROS: Good location- while it's not in uptown Sedona, it is in an area that has a ton of great things to do (if you're OK with a little drive, versus the uptown walking). We did not use the concierge services, but I did email with questions and they responded almost immediately with a ton of helpful info! Check in was quick and simple, desk clerk was pleasant and told us about the main important points of the hotel. They offer a morning breakfast, but we did not eat there because we had other plans that morning. The desk clerk recommended a restaurant to us the night of our stay, which was a fabulous place we'd never been to before. Very grateful for that! We were also able to obtain park passes right at the desk, which was very convenient. Rooms were clean and had simple, relaxing decor, and a lot of great local area info on the desk.CONS: I don't know what the rates are during other times of the year (we stayed last weekend), but paying $200 for that room was insane. From what we had read and saw online, we expected a much different experience. We have stayed at comparable hotels in the area for half as much, with the exact same amenities and service. I would not call this place a ""resort"" by any means- no restaurant, room service, spa, etc...NOT a resort! The bed in this room was a flat box with jabby springs. We had two queen beds, and tried both in case one was just an older mattress. We both slept poorly and did not enjoy the evening there. Not comfortable at all!! Also, this is by far the LOUDEST hotel I have ever stayed in. While I don't hold to hotel responsible for the large herd of screaming children that were running up and down the stairs and sidewalks at 6:30am (though it would've been nice if someone asked them to be respectful of the other guests...), the housekeepers/maintenance were just as disruptive. They were yelling in to 2-way radios, banging on doors, slamming doors shut, clanging around with their housekeeping carts, and yelling across the hotel to each other. After a night of little sleep, being forced awake at 7am was not appreciated on our vacation. Also, the rooms themselves have zero soundproofing and we could hear everything above and alongside us, including each car in the parking lot in front of the room. Paid extra for the patio ""upgrade""- total waste of money, as the 1990's patio furniture was worn out and there were 6 earwigs on the wall and floor area. No thanks!We will not be staying here again. This was not the worst place I've ever been, and there are a number of good aspects to this place. But, for the (INSANE) amount of money they're asking, lack of comfort and disappointing ""upgrades""- it just isn't worth it. There are other places in town that provide far more for far less money.My mom and I spent a week in Sedona in August, and picked the Sedona Real Inn &amp; Suites because it was inexpensive, had a complimentary breakfast, and was reasonably close to what we wanted to do. It was absolutely fantastic. We got a suite with a balcony, which overlooked the pool and then the mountains. Really nice to sit out on the balcony in the morning or while the sun was setting and read with a beautiful backdrop. The continental breakfast also had a waffle iron, eggs and sausage (in addition to traditional continental breakfast fare). There was plenty of seating, and even though breakfast was crowded, we never had a hard time finding someplace to sit. Anytime anything was out, all I had to do was ask the attendant to get more, and she'd bring more out. Two weeks before we went, they posted a discount code for a last minute getaway. We had already booked our hotel with a different coupon code, and when we called, they changed it to the lower rate - no problem. The concierge were always helpful and friendly. There were no elevators, but we requested a second floor room so we could have a better view of the mountains. We had no problem pulling our suitcases up the stairs to the second floor. I know the hotel is pet friendly, but I didn't hear a single dog barking while we were in the room. (I heard some while we were out of the room, so I know they were there somewhere!!) We requested foam pillows and a feather free room, and that was all correct when we checked in. I accidentally turned the fireplace on and couldn't figure out how to turn it off - the front desk came up immediately and turned it off for me. All the pictures of the pool and the mountains? If you're looking at the hotel in those pictures, the room we stayed in is just off to the left. We did a bunch of self guided driving tours (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsedonadrivetours.com&amp;s=1a525d0c52318e88aacf2e79ddd253471a034648420e0fe0f770414edabb2669"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">sedonadrivetours.com</a>, walkabout audio tours of montezuma well/castle, sunset crater, and petrified forest). I feel like we just barely grazed the surface of what Sedona has to offer. WHEN we go back, we will definitely stay at the Sedona Real Inn &amp; Suites again. =)Went for a quick getaway last weekend and stayed here. The place was pretty cool. We got the whirlpool suite which we affectionately named the perv suite. The room literally had a big ass jacuzzi tub in the living room area, 2 leather chairs around it and a huge mirror on the wall next to it. The room was clean and nicely done though, 2 flat screen TV's, kitchenette comfy bed, and all the other standard stuff. We got the room for about $180 for the night- call for your reservations, we got a 10% discount by asking for it ;)The staff was all friendly and the included breakfast was pretty good- simple, but good. They were definitely understaffed in the breakfast area though and they ran out of coffee, a big no no in my book. I would definitely stay here again though, I keep the places that are clean!Expectations are everything, and for the somewhere around $130 I paid to stay here a few years ago, I was unimpressed. While the hotel is conveniently located across from a shopping plaza with dining options in Sedona's less touristy section, it offered nothing else that might have set it apart, and lots that I found detrimental to enjoyment. My room was dark and dingy and the bedding not as comfortable as I'm accustomed to at that price point.Good breakfast included with room. Queen suite was roomy, had refrigerator, microwave, DVD player and a good sized bathroom, AC unit kinda noisy. Only in Sedona this time for one night, decent value for the money, I would definitely consider staying here again.Just spent four  nights here with my wife and kids.  Good family hotel, clean, safe area.  West side of Sedona out of the way from all the happenings in ""up-town"".  The concierge was great providing us a lot of great ideas of things to do in Sedona.  The morning breakfast was okay to start the day, although after four days I was getting a little burned out on the selection.  If it was just a weekend with my wife, I might pick a little nicer place to stay, but for a family on the go, it covered all the basics and was very comfortable, and they gave us a great rate.Very comfortable, good price and a great breakfast! The rooms are spacious, the beds were amazing and held a million pillows. They also provide a great amount of towels, so you do not need to ask for more after you have gone swimming or soaked in the hot tub.Except for the very disappointing complimentary breakfast, the Inn provides a very good level of service. Its location is a bit distant from the center of Sedona but is right at the intersection of Dry Creek Road. That makes it a good location for many of the hiking trails that are reached off of Dry Creek.  Price is good. Concierge is very knowledgable.  Next door restaurant ""Relics"" provides room service but the food is over priced. the only thing in favor of the restaurant is its proximity to the hotel.We absoulutely loved our stay here.  We traveled the beginning of February and were treated to some light snow.  This was our first time in Sedona and it was for a very short visit.  The room was clean and even though we didn't use it, I loved that there was a mini fridge, a microwave and a coffee maker.  The bed was very comfortable.  There was also a small closet, which I might have found useful if I was staying longer.  The main reason I loved this place for two reasons: location and service.  It seemed right in the middle of town and when we walked out of our room we had an amazing view.  We checked and and the girls behind the desk were nice and checked us in quickly.  When I asked about what kind of hikes we could do on our short visit she referred us to the gentleman right behind us at the concierge.  I think his name was Todd.  I wish I remembered because he gave us such great suggestions.  We traveled with our 6 year old boy and didn't want anything too difficult or dangerous.  The hikes he suggested were perfect.  He also told us about a FREE guided hike at the Red Rock State Park.The breakfast was really good and we made sure we filled up before our hike.  The best part is we get a 15% off discount for the next time that we stay there.  This is a trip that I will plan again.  Maybe in Spring when it's not snowing or too hot.  The next trip will be a much longer and we will definitly stay here.","At first I was disappointed with my room -- bottom floor, shabby bedding (small tears in the sheets and loose threads in the comforter).  The one window opened onto the walkway so I had to keep my curtain shut the entire time for privacy.  But after a few days, it grew on me.  It was clean and had a decent shower, and I slept well.  Except for the neighbors who slam their door at 6AM -- what is up with that?! The complimentary breakfast had a lot of choices and good coffee, and I could take my plate to my room if it was too crowded.  It was a nice routine to start my day with eggs or a toasted bagel and the newspaper.The pool was small and uninviting to me, but if there hadn't been so many kids I would have at least tried it.The concierge ladies were both very nice and helpful and gave me great suggestions for dining, nightlife and hiking trails.I can't remember exactly how much I paid -- probably around $130 a night.  It was a good value and a comfortable place to stay.  If I come again I would only book a room with a balcony and a top floor.The free breakfast alone warrants five stars! Waffle iron, eggs, yogurt, juice, coffee, tea, bagels, sausage... Amazing. The staff was also incredibly friendly and helpful. They have a nice selection of movies to rent for $2 from the front desk and even give you a bag of popcorn to go with it. The rooms were nice, clean, and comfortable. Would definitely stay again!Last minute decision to stay in Sedona on our vacation and got a good rate here.  If we ever go back to Sedona, I would stay here again.  We stayed in one of the rooms with a single king sized bed, not a suite.  It was clean, nicely furnished, and as soon as we stepped out of our room, have a great view of the surrounding red rocks!  The staff was extreme helpful is suggesting places to go hiking.  We used the pool/hot tub - nice clean.  The place was well landscaped.  It was also easy to find and close enough to downtown for us (a 5-10 min drive).  Breakfast was fine; however, we were told breakfast was at 7am, it wasn't until 8am, so we got a late start on that day's hike.  That might have been our own misunderstanding, though.  I would recommend this place!My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary with a several day stay in Sedona, and stayed for four days in this hotel. The room was a spacious mini-suite -- two queen beds, dresser, desk, mini-bar with small refrigerator and microwave, couch, small table, chairs, and gas fireplace. It was spotlessly clean. The breakfast (included with the room) featured scrambled eggs, sausage links, and waffles as well as the usual continental breakfast stuff. The view from our room was quite nice, and there is a washer/dryer on the property for guests. Good place, good value.Our first trip to Sedona and this place was great!  Location was close to lots of hiking trails and the concierge was VERY helpful for a first timer.  Rooms were pretty good, nothing special but clean and beds were comfortable.  The free breakfast was perfect!  My only suggestion is to get a room in the middle building instead of one of the ones facing the street.  The road noise woke us up a few times.We will stay there again when we go back!Second time in Sedona, and second time at Sedona Real Inn. Great hotel out of the busy downtown area. Large rooms and suites at reasonable rate. Good breakfast and help desk. Plenty of restaurants and hiking trails nearby. We will stay again at this hotel on our next visit.My hubby and I stayed here for one night in March. Upon arrival, the grounds looked really nice and maintained. We weren't able to check-in but mainly b/c we arrived a little early...around 11am, so housekeepers were still working on cleaning up the rooms. It worked out fine for us since we just headed down the street to the downtown area and had some lunch @ Wildflower Bread Co. before our Pink Jeep Tour through Sedona. When we checked-in later that night, the room was ready and clean. Huge bed and more than enough room for just one night. The only qualms we had was the ridiculously loud heating vent that would kick on throughout the night, waking us up from our slumber. Other than that, quiet neighborhood and neighbors. I would probably stay there again if I came back to Sedona.Very large and comfortable rooms.  The suites have a small kitchenette (fridge, microwave, sink and coffeemaker) which can be useful, with a sitting area and gas fireplace.  Flat-screen TV in the room.  There was a double-sink area separate from the toilet/bath.  Free ""continental"" breakfast (except that there were eggs and sausage) and a very friendly staff.We liked the location, in West Sedona just off the main highway.  Convenience to shopping and many of the trails.  Not especially scenic but lots of Sedona (including the entire uptown drag) is not scenic per se - just surrounded by incredible scenery.Right on the main drag into Sedona, this place was reasonably priced, and easy to find.  We had a double queen suite, meaning we also had a refrigerator, which is always nice.  And the room had a fireplace that was on a switch, rather than having to light a fire.  The staff were helpful, and recommended some great places to go in town.  It was across the street from a good veg restaurant, and yet not noisey, even though it was on the highway.  There was a small walk out deck, but we didn't use it.Nice, comfortable and clean.  The rooms aren't anything special, but it was spacious and nice to have a kitchenette.  Great location, decent pool.  We booked on hotwire and were pleased with what we got.","['read', 'reviews', 'place', 'decided', 'take', 'risk', 'know', 'reviewer', 'said', 'far', 'main', 'drag', 'like', 'avoid', 'congestion',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/amara-resort-and-spa-a-kimpton-hotel-sedona,"Amara Resort and Spa, a Kimpton Hotel",4.0,$$$,223,"We stayed one night and had nothing but a great experience! The location is great, the staff nice, the food good, and the room was nice and clean.They have a nightly wine ""happy hour"" that was a nice little extra.We had our 2 dogs with us and they were VERY dog friendly! They put dog bowls, poop bags, treats, and a dog bed in our room.We will definitely be back in the future!If I could give them a half of a star I would. This hotel lost us a checkin and never got us back. My wife and I like to stay at nice hotels and this isn't it. It felt like throwing money away. On check in the valet insisted we couldn't touch the baggage cart but then proceeded to have us unload our own luggage onto the cart (so weird!). Then he said he would meet us up in the room with the luggage. After waiting at least 15 minutes and no luggage we went back to see what happened and it was just sitting on the cart in the lobby with with three valets (including the one who said he would bring it up) just standing around talking outside- they weren't busy.They also have a resort fee of $27 a night that pays for nothing. They allow you to use the steam room at the spa but not sure that is worth the resort fee. We never used it. They also make you call for ice- a way to help their staff makes tips (probably the same issue with the luggage cart they won't let you touch). Again it just feels grubby. They need to pay their staff decently enough that the place isn't run for employee tips.The room itself showed some signs of wear. There was a glass shelf in the bathroom that was so broken and tilted it really should not have had glasses on it. I kept wondering how hard would it have been for the people that clean the room to put in a work order to have it fixed. The toilet paper holder was totally non functioning-the toilet paper wouldn't stay on-again it really showed no one cared or took ""ownership"".As I said we like to stay at nice hotels and are happy to pay for them. We just got back from a trip to Florida where we paid 2x as much a night for our room and it was so worth it. Find a nicer place to stay or save your money and stay at a Hampton Inn - at least you won't feel stupid throwing your money away.This place was awesome!!!I just returned home from a 2-nights stay in Sedona and totally enjoyed my time here.  The hotel/rooms were very nice but I wouldn't say overly fancy.  What they may lack (and I say ""may"") in over-the-top plush rooms, (tho they were very nice and comfy) they totally excel in when it comes to service!  EVERYONE was so accommodating!  We had a sign in our room that summed it up.  It's the typical sign that says ""did you forget something because we've got it"" and lists out all the commonly forgotten items but the sign finishes it off by saying, ""...or we'll go get it""!!  That's great!  The front desk staff is very helpful in providing recommendations or printing out information on local attraction.  The morning yoga, included in the resort fee ($22 which also covers your parking), is totally a must do!  It was such a great way to start the day.  (sign up in advance!)  They have an evening ""wine hour"" with little nibbles and a morning coffee bar (yes, I know these are kinda common) but they also have a ""make your own trail mix"" bar to accommodate anyone going out for a hike.  (Which it seems to be the most popular thing to do in Sedona!)  AND, as if that isn't enough to encourage you to make your reservation right now, they have a shuttle service that will drop you off/pick you up when you are ready to head to dinner!  (Who needs Uber!?!?)   They are also dog friendly!  I'm definitely going back!Great service, outstanding location (right in the center of downtown, but tucked far away form the street so it's super quiet), perfect views of the red rocks and next to a lovely creek, coffee in the morning, free yoga, wine in the evening, free shuttle to nearby spots, and an anniversary surprise awaiting us upon check in? Of course this place is awesome!There may have been a few too many kids for my liking but, the real problem with the kids was their parents who chose not to control them.  There's nothing like 5-6 kids running around 'playing' and shrieking very loudly, building a fort out of outdoor seating cushions, and having said fort fall over and break a wine glass during the 'relaxing' wine hour overlooking the red rocks.  Again, not the hotel's fault, but, perhaps an employee who saw such shenanigans could have politely said something to the little changelings or perhaps to their parents.  That being said, I've never met a Kimpton property I didn't like and Sedona's is a great one, too! In fact, a friend of mine has chosen to stay there now based on my experiences (minus the kid part, of course!).My husband &amp; I stayed at Amara for our baby moon. I especially appreciated the details such as hot cocoa during the complimentary wine hour for those who prefer non-alcoholic drinks. We thoroughly enjoyed the view of the red rocks as well as the fire pits outside, which staff carefully left rolled blankets for guest comfort. Salt rock restaurant is where we decided to eat almost every night because the quality of food at the hotel was superior to the touristy restaurants along the popular strip.Looking for a five-star hotel and amenities with three-star prices? Look no further. Actually, you get a three maybe four star hotel room but the hotel is upgraded to a four-star hotel due to high level of service, the majestic views and all of the amenities, including a day spa, complementary yoga classes, a beautiful pool, a nice restaurant (reasonable prices), valet parking and a convenient shuttle. The most outstanding thing about the hotel is the incredible service you are provided. Everyone in the hotel is very nice, very professional and outstandingly helpful. The one negative is that you have to take the shuttle or walk up a steep hill to get to the main strip.One surprise bonus to the hotel is the creek in the back. Its nice to see some natural waterflows in a dry desert environment.Everybody was prompt in their service, whether it was the check in, the valet or room service. See my review on the restaurant. The punchline is that it's excellent. I was a little surprised by the fact the in room movies were actual DVDs you had to get from the front desk. The selection was pretty good but it would have been nice to have a streaming service with new releases like so many other hotels. It was a little distracting with several little dogs barking. This hotel is dog friendly.I stayed here once on a work trip and absolutely LOVED it. Cushy things for sleeping, nice bathrooms, nice artwork, and Mezcal at the bar. Could a girl ask for anything more? Yes. If I were absurd, I could ask for yoga classes in the morning and a mat in my room so I didn't have to think about packing one. GUESS WHAT! They have yoga classes in the morning and a mat in your room so you don't have to think about packing one.I haven't stayed in many places in Sedona, so I can't say this place is for sure the best, but I can definitely say that I would come back and recommend this place to anyone.This is a good location, downtown Sedona with lots of local flavor in close proximity. Staff and hospitality seems to be top priority and the facility is fairly quiet. Mostly adults at this location great for couples retreat or newlyweds families with kids not so much....Great view from the court yard and nice fireplaces to sit by at night, the turf is a plus in this rocky red earth.The service we received here was fantastic from the valet guys to the front desk and everyone else we ran into.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful, anyone we came into contact with offered a greeting and offered assistance if we needed it, great staff!!  The location is nicely tucked off the main street and right by the creek, peaceful and quiet.  We had a room facing the creek and we made use of our patio in the evenings listening to the nightlife.  While we overall had a nice stay there were just a few dings that made this resort feel like it wasn't worth what we paid.  For starters we were there to celebrate my birthday and while it was never mentioned (completely ok) my boyfriend had requested a bottle of Veuve be waiting for us on arrival.  The champagne was there along with some flutes and that was all.  Really?  No ice?  Even if we had gotten in late and it had been sitting in a bucket of melted ice we would at least know they tried.  Then came the second problem, they don't have ice machines.  You need to call room service for small ziploc bags of ice.  We did and 45 minutes later I called back to check on the ice.  Another 20 minutes later we received the ice and started chilling our warm champagne.  Maybe a slight oversight but at a place like this I would expect more.  Bedding was comfortable except for the pillows, they were very thin and just plain terrible.  The room was spacious and nicely decorated.  The bathroom had a great huge spa tub, clean and well stocked.  However, the rug was frayed and old looking.  So while we had a great time around Sedona and the staff was friendly and resort clean, we were surprised by the lack of attention to detail.As for the Spa itself it was AMAZING and I think that's what really won us over.  The spa building sits right in front of the entrance to the lobby on the opposite side of the driveway.  We walked over one morning for our 10 a.m. massage appointments and the minute you walk through the door you begin to relax.  The receptionist showed me to the ladies room and explained the procedure of getting ready to wait for your masseuse.  You are given a locker to store your belongings and clothing while you're there, a robe to change into and some sandals.  There is a complete array of toiletries in case you take advantage of their showers and by complete I mean deoderant, lotions of all types for face and body, hair products for every kind of hair style, rubber bands, q tips, cotton balls, face wash, makeup remover, the list goes on.  Anyway once you have undressed you have a plush robe to head out to the waiting room.  There is a typical questionnaire you need to fill out about yourself and your body.  The room has comfortable chairs, low lighting and quiet music playing.  There is a water station with hot tea to sip while you wait.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed an extremely well done hot stone couples massage that left us feeling like jelly afterwards.  I wish I remembered our therapists names because they were so sweet.  When the massage was over they walked us over to a little inlet with two lounge chairs that could be closed off with a curtain.  They brought us a bottle of apple cider and cheers-ed us for my birthday!  I was so touched, it was the perfect little unexpected detail.  We would be back to visit the Spa in a heartbeat.Wow, what a waste of money! We were so disappointed in this hotel and the customer service. This was our first and last Kimpton. My husband and I like nice hotels and are happy to pay for them but paying for this hotel made us feel like fools. Every where you turn here it feels like they are grubbing for money. A $27 a day resort fee that pays for no services we would use. Maybe it supposed to be for the morning yoga but if I did want a yoga class it wouldn't cost $27. Checkin and the valet service was horrid and we had to actually go back to the valet to try to find our luggage after waiting 15 minutes in the room for it. The luggage was sitting in the lobby while the valets talked to each other-they weren't busy! Despite the fact they weren't bringing the luggage up to the room the valet said we could not take the cart to the room ourselves ! Help they are holding our luggage hostage! For reasons I won't go into on our last day the women at the front desk actually made a snide comment and rolled her eyes in disgust at something  my husband said. She later had the good sense to not ask us on checkout how we enjoyed our stay. I think they are trying to be a cutesy camp for adults with games, yoga, a cocoa bar etc. These are not services my husband and I need or are very impressed with -we do pretty well at planning our own trips. Again we are happy to pay for nice hotels but this place just seemed like a wanna be. We just came back from a trip to Florida where we paid 2-3x a night more for our hotel room  and it was so worth it. AND NO ONE, NO ONE should EVER make fun of a customer by making snide comments or rolling their eyes! Such behavior is immature and intended to be hurtful. Not exactly a place you want to spend your money.I saw some good reviews and my guess is that those people don't travel too much and aren't aware what they should be receiving - or maybe they are just happy to find a place that has water bowls outside for their dogs. Whatever it is, it's beyond me. Our experience was was entirely substandard and a waste of money.Awesome location right in the center of the action in uptown. The views and the infinity pool are breath taking. Great spot to check out shops and a nice launch point to explore the rocks and vortexes in the area. Valet is comp and make sure to check out the wine hour at 5 daily.We visited late December and took our pet. The room was nice a clean.  In the morning there was complimentary coffee and at night wine for social hour. We also ate at the restaurant for breakfast and it was very good.We stayed here for two nights on our way to Grand Canyon. Crazy friendly staff all around. Very clean establishment and lovely decor. Complimentary happy hour every day and build your own trail mix bar :)Love the infinity pool and view of the red rocks.Loved this place.The pool was amazing.  The staff was super accomidating.  The wine hour was fantastic, especially with the ""yard"" area.  At night it is a wonderful place to have cocktails by the fire.The rooms were fine.  The only problem is if you are at the end of the complex you are going to be walking forever to get anywhere, but it was fine.Everyone was great.  Definitely stay here if given the chance.I've had a soft spot for Kimpton properties for a long time, probably close to 20 years.  We were going to Sedona for part of a vacation and when I saw Kimpton had a place there, I didn't have to think about it.  But the dark side to my love of Kimpton is that they've always been amazing and I have really high expectations.If I were to compare the Amara to just any hotel, I'd be ecstatic.  And if I were to compare it to a really nice hotel like a Waldorf-Astoria, I'd still like it.  But for a Kimpton, I have to say that even though we really liked it, it was the least flawless experience I've had to date.  Maybe it's because Kimpton hotels were acquired in 2014 and changes are happening behind the scenes.  Maybe I just didn't have my usual luck.  I don't know but here are some examples:The message light on the room phone is on.  We press the message button and nothing happens.  Call the front desk to tell them we can't get our messages and they tell us we have to dial 444 for messages.  We dial 444 and the automated system says there are no voice messages but we should call the front desk for a message.  We call the front desk back and this time they're happy to give us our message.The toilet in the room is having trouble and I report it, they say they'll take care of it.  The fix lasts for 4 or 5 flushes and we have to call them back so they can try again the next morning.The artwork in the bathroom is a sign that says ""Let's stay home.""  What are you telling me, Amara?And after I left they charged some minibar items to my card even though I had a ""Raid the minibar"" credit and it should have been free.  It was fixed with a quick call.These kind of things don't normally happen at a Kimpton property.  Things just work at Kimptons and that's all there is to it.  Everybody without exception was really friendly.  Everything was very nice from the pool to the wine hour to their pet-friendly policy.  I love it all, but for problems to be where a guest can see them is just unusual.Please Kimpton, I hope you aren't starting to turn into just another hotel chain.Okay, more about the Amara.  The views are as amazing as anywhere in Sedona and access to the creek is a real plus.  But the driveway is a minus.  It's steep, it's curvy, it's dark at night.  And in parts, pedestrians have to share the narrow road with people who don't know where they're going.  The hotel's shuttle give you a lift up to the street if you want and then come get you if you need them to.  At night, take them up on this.Although much of the review deals with small problems, I was really happy with our stay at the Amara.  Nothing significant went wrong and that's something I've always been able to count on.  Seriously, stay here.  You'll be pampered, you'll have a terrific time, and you'll probably get to meet a few friendly dogs in the lobby as well!A surprise on many fronts. Following a business trip to Phoenix, my husband surprised me with a trip to Sedona. He then surprised me by making hotel arrangements. I was enthralled with his choice. The room was clean and spacious. The maid actually left us a note to thank us for the tip we left. We had two meals at the hotel:  who knew that deviled eggs with maple syrup and a tart onion marmalade would work so well. The staff chose a delightful tequila for my husband and I sipped a hot tottie. We spent a day hiking (we got lost or it would have been shorter.). Returned to hotel for a much anticipated couples massage. Our stay was too short. Weather became a factor, so we reluctantly left early (us SoCal folks can really wuss out.).   My husband promised to return to Sedona in the spring and there will be no guessing where we will stay. Amara has it all: great location, beautiful accommodations, great food and wonderful spa. See you in April!PS. Staff is also top notch!This place is a dump! Booked a four night stay here and immediately regretted it. The place looks and feels like a dirty old motel with modern furniture. And guess what?! That's EXACTLY what it is! It's outdated, cramped and GHETTO. When Kimpton bought this old crappy hotel two years ago they only spent 1M to revamp it. For those of you who have never renovated a house, 1M IS NOT REAL MONEY. And this isn't just a house - this is an entire resort. From the crappy 80's-style original metal railings to the motel balconies and the DISGUSTING  old mattresses, this place is a crap hole! We tried switching to the Enchanted or the L'Auberge but since it's high season they were sold out. Stay away from this place!! Yuck!!The 2 stars is ONLY for the staff! The guys at valet and the shuttle are the BEST!!!!!This hotel is gorgeous! The pool area is relaxing and the view is amazing. We loved the hotel staff. The font desk ladies were helpful and personable. The food was delicious and we had a great server. I sing understand why people would give a bad review.Could not have asked for a better spot! Right by the creek, amazing vista of the red rocks. Rooms are pristine, hotel grounds are immaculate! The little things this hotel offers go a long ways: smores kit by the fire, wine-hour in lobby, make your own trail mix. All sort of little amenities and the staff is very attentive and kind.Stayed three nights for a very special long weekend.  Be careful on the room they choose for you.  Opened our drapes and viewed a ladder against a fence and what looked to be a construction site behind the fence.  Notice their website only shows the beautiful view!  There were three of us in the room and we had to request wash cloths and towels twice.  Hair dryers are very cheap and overheat quickly so we had to request more since there was only one hair dryer in the room.  Too much money for a view of a ladder and construction area.  To arrive at our room, we had to enter and exit three buildings.  It is very dark between the buildings at night.  Of course we were assigned a room as far from the front entry as you could possibly be.  Not impressed with this hotel.","Sedona was great, but it was really staying at the Amara that was the icing on the cake. First off, the place itself is cozy, yet with an eclectic/upscale vibe that makes you feel somewhere special. To elaborate: there was a mixture of bright colors to accent features, yet still wooden aspects as well. I guess you could call it ""hipster"" for lack of a better term. The infinity pool reflects one of the impressive rock formations in the area, and they have a restaurant that overlooks the pool and grass area where people can enjoy a drink and relax. One other thing: they are right on the creek and have a nice walkway down to this so you can enjoy a stroll on the creek. The service was spectacular as well. The valet gentlemen there are the highlight though! There is free valet which is a huge benefit because you are able to walk to a lot of the shops and restaurants in the area. The valet guys though are extremely personable and literally run to your car to guarantee efficiency in timing.  One of the maids went out of her way to wish us a happy day, and the concierge upon arrival was really nice as well. For me it is also the little things that make a place great and unique: there was a water bowl outside welcoming the dogs that were guests at the hotel as well, you have free access to yoga classes and a sauna that are offered by the spa, there is a complementary wine hour and they have really great quality shampoo/conditioners. One con though!! There were no coffee makers in the room. They did have complementary coffee until 10 in the lobby, but I am someone that appreciates waking up in your robe and having a cup of coffee without going to fetch it. And the room service coffee is $4 a cup! Overall I really loved this place and know that there will not be another place in Sedona that I will venture to.Amazing property and team. Katie B was our host for Christmas vacation 2016. She and her team were simply outstanding. The kids were given special attention and our whole family of 10 loved the experience. Thank you Katie and team Amara!!!With a heavy heart I can only give three stars. Cheers to the location in town and great views. And the staff for the most part were nice. I really loved the infinity pool (albeit small) and the game area, in all its AstroTurf glory. In response to the other reviewers comment on the restaurant hours, everything in Sedona seems to close at 9, nor does anything open particularly early, either. It's a weird town that way. I just don't see this as a 4-star hotel--my room just seemed grimy in a way paint can't just cover, I could barely get into my bathroom because the door kept sticking, there were makeup soaked fingerprints all over the bathroom that weren't my shade, the bath products were weak, the pillows lumpy...  And the workout room is a dungeon.  Short of the long: the not-negligible room prices are for location, not necessarily quality. Which is kinda true throughout all of Sedona, in retrospect. So just... Be aware.   I'm thinking the 5-star ratings may be from people who don't travel much.Great location! Hotel rooms are a bit dated, but they make up for it with service and lobby.  Love the complimentary coffee bar every morning, and wine in the evening.  Attached restaurant has great food and drinks.  Unfortunately, there were some storms that rolled in, so we were unable to enjoy the beautiful pool. We did, however, get a chance to enjoy the fire pit outside with a glass of wine.Customer service is amazing-- valet was on point every time (we retrieved our car at least 7 times) and front desk was very accommodating.  THANK you to the front desk for acknowledging our anniversary and sending us a special treat to our rooms!My husband and I specifically booked a room at the Amara because we love Kimpton properties and try to stay in them every time we travel.  This property does not live up to the experience we have come to expect.  The property itself is not as visually appealing as others.  When we asked the front desk staff where we could find a store with greeting cards, he seemed to be unfamiliar with the area and didn't offer much help.  Even worse, we had specifically told the hotel prior to our arrival that we had just gotten married on July 18 and that this was the first stop on our honeymoon.  There was no mention of this when we checked in, there was no note or anything in the room to mark the occasion.  When we have stayed at Kimpton hotels for special occasions in the past, the hotel always goes out of their way to celebrate it.  At the Canary in Santa Barbara, they provided a bottle of champagne and a card for my husband's (then fiance) birthday.  At the Amara?  Nothing.On top of all that, we realized less than an hour after we left that we had forgotten three garments in the closet.  When we called back, the staff was really not helpful in terms of trying to address it.  They transferred me to housekeeping, where I just kept getting bounced from voicemail to voicemail.  I called the hotel again and had to give my credit card information for the shipping and was promised a call back.  No call back.  We called twice more to confirm that they had found my garments and then were promised a call with a tracking number.  Still waiting on that call.  The customer service here is NOT what we expect from Kimpton.  My husband and I will continue to stay at Kimpton properties elsewhere but would not waste our money at Amara. I recommend you don't waste yours there either!Lack of basic amenities was shocking. Asked for ice bucket and got delivered 2 ziplock full of ice. Bizarre.Restaurant bar &amp; room service all end at 9pm.No real service at the pool.Glasses for toothbrushes are placed above the toilet bowl. Gross. Low quality of bedding and furniture doesn't match the price at $400/ night. Everything felt so cheap and corners cut. Overpriced and feel ripped off. For $400 / night?! Albanian bartender was very nice and made nice cocktails.View of the parking lot for $300 a night? Underwhelmed to say the least. The place is filthy. I cancelled my second night reservation and fortunately got a refund. I was surprised that the hotel clerk didn't ask me for feedback. The best part of the stay were the Valets who offered me ice water on my way out.Amara Resort and Spa was such a beautiful and relaxing place to stay, my boyfriend and I couldn't have asked for more from the resort during our 5 day stay.  It felt like a five star hotel, but without the pretentious attitude.  Wine hour was definitely a fun time, and we loved that you can either relax inside or outside in the grass or pool area.  David was working the wine hour one of the nights and really made an effort to get to know my boyfriend and I. I also want to mention the wonderful people working at the spa.  Jacy and Megan (I believe that was her name) were so great and helped us both book our appointments for massages, and were so friendly and welcoming.  They knew it was my boyfriend's birthday, so they sent him off with an adorable personalized bday card, face cream samples and some epsom salt to use at a later time after his massage. The spa was so clean and peaceful, we were very impressed with it all.  We were also very pleased with our massages, as they were just what we needed. :)Thank you to everyone for the wonderful service, including all of those we didn't mention, since everyone was so great.  We honestly can't wait to return!!This place is absolutely wonderful. The resort grounds are beautiful and the atmosphere is relaxing and serene. Everyone at the hotel is friendly, helpful and responsive. Special shout out to Dustin (sp?) the bartender at Saltrock (restaurant inside resort). He was friendly, nice and a great bartender! We truly enjoyed sitting and chatting with him and other hotel guests. Nathan and Chelsey at the front desk were also wonderful and helpful! The $22/day resort fee is nothing considering the amenities this place provides, i.e yoga class, complimentary wine hour from 5-6 (you can sit inside or outside by the fire pits and watch the sun set) and the hot chocolate and coffee bar, the coffee is amazing! The shuttle the resort offers is extremely convenient and quick. They also have a list of things they provide free of charge that people frequently forget, i.e. phone charger, toiletries, razors, etc.! Finally, we were here for our anniversary and the resort gave us a special gift and a handwritten card. This place is truly a wonderful get away and we had a fabulous experience.I stayed for only one night but had a great experience. The hotel is built right on the river and still has great views of the canyons and bluffs.  They also have pretty much any amenity you could ask for: free yoga in the morning, spa, infinity pool, giant Jenga and lawn games, fire pits, free wine happy hour and more. The staff is friendly and the rooms are spacious and very nice. The hotel is also near a shopping strip so you can check out shops and restaurants.The drive into Sedona though the 89A canyon is also breathtaking.This hotel just needs a good, long combat tour in Vietnam.I enjoyed my stay here, though it wouldn't necessarily have been my first choice. My wife booked the place, and if you are into the crunchy, hippie, holistic spa experience, you will absolutely love it. I was just pleased that the rooms were clean, they had a nice pool and smoked bacon at breakfast that was so damned good I needed a 3 hour, Australian-imported eucalyptus-infused hot quartz river rock glute massage to calm down. The location can't be beat either, as it is centrally located among many of the shops and restaurants, though set back just enough to remain a peaceful retreat. Check out the fire pits with complimentary blankets after the sun goes down- I believe you'll find the experience more relaxing than an Acai and wheatgrass upside-down high colonic administered by a Swedish fitness model wearing a cucumber and bitter melon mud mask.This is a lovely hotel with a lovely situation and some great service, the valets and some of the front desk are wonderful. The pool is lovely but shallow throughout and smaller.  The grounds and situation are some of the best around and it backs up to a lovely walk along the river.  They serve wine and a few snacks in the evening which is a nice touch.  This alone might be worth it for you but the rest of the hotel did not live up to my expectations at the price point.  For the price, which is about 20-40% more than I've paid for four and five star resorts in Hawaii and Europe, it just doesn't compare all that favorably.  At $200 a night I'd be all about it, but if I compare it to say, the Hapuna Beach Prince or the Mauna Kea in Hawaii, it doesn't stand up and I've stayed both places for less than I paid here.  Of course, local economy always factors in but I don't think one can argue that Hawaii's local economy is more forgiving than Sedona's.  How did it not stand up? A) The bathrooms are tiny and not luxuriously appointed.  There is one small sink on a stand - no vanity or space for toiletries. There is a temporary moveable cart across from the toilet. Even the toilet paper is awkwardly positioned.  Other reviews mentioned the toiletries; they were not premium - fine but not premium. I've had kiehls toiletries in other 4-5 star hotels - this wasn't that quality.  Moreover a bag of unopened sample size premium toiletries that I brought with me was thrown away on the second day of my stay and only the ziploc bag was replaced (after my second phone call to the front desk). B) The rooms are not large. The size alone is not such a problem but in the double rooms the bases of the beds stick out beyond the mattresses and consistently catch the shins of the taller among us as there isn't a whole lot of room to navigate around them.  I have black and blue shins - really.  C) Entertainment systems - no premium channels or guide that I could find and no speakers or stereo for plugin to smart phone.  I missed my music. Wi-fi requires payment - your money or all your information - you pick and you'll have to sign in every time. D) Some rude staff.  Was admonished by a bar-tender for slopping a bit of coffee on the bar after putting some ice in my coffee. One woman followed me in to the lobby restroom just after this and sort of scared me with her effusive inquiries about my stay but that might just be me being strange.  E) For a hotel that prides itself on being a resort and spa, I expect good workout facilities.  Workout room was sub-par; windowless and grey with only one funky looking elliptical machine (there were other machines, just one elliptical).  Really, the windowless thing was the biggest problem. F) This is a bit nit-picky but the patios opening to the pool are filled with sharp little rocks so if you intend to barefoot it from your room to the pool, you'll have a few moments of masochism. In the end, I don't regret staying here and I won't completely rule out a return but I was left feeling uncomfortable with the value for the reasons outlined above.I absolutely love Kimpton Hotels and when I saw they had a property in Sedona, I jumped at the chance to stay here.  I paid extra to get a room overlooking Oak Creek Canyon and I was not disappointed.  The room was gorgeous and complete with two patios and a Jacuzzi tub that looked out onto Oak Creek and red cliffs behind it.  The grounds were very nice, too.  I went for Valentine's Day weekend and the pool was heated so my little Valentines spent a few hours swimming while I relaxed one of the comfy cabana beds.  When the wine hour started, they had a choice between wine and hotty toddies, I chose wine and went back to the pool.  When I went back for seconds the person serving wine accused me of breaking the glass because I was sitting in the pool area, I hadn't noticed but the glass had a crack.  I was taken back that I was being accused of breaking the glass instead of receiving an apology for being served wine in a broken glass.  When we arrived back in our room we noticed some ants had gathered at the sink to lick our toothpaste. On our way to go for a walk, I notified a staff member and it was never addressed again.  Throughout our stay we saw more ants in the sitting room and again in the shower.  Since no one was bitten, I just let it go.  The food from the hotel restaurant was delicious.  The staff was really laid back but accommodating in their own way.  I will definitely be back, ants and all.I'm glad this was only my birthday and not a really special occasion. We're not waiting 10-15min upon arrival to get our bags to room, I may be disabled, but I can take the cart to our room. While getting there someone from accounting was insisting that he get someone to help... Here's a thought, have people from accounting plus-up the front door on a Friday evening so as not to give a bad 1st impression.In room, (with parking lot views full of Toyota Prius) the staff is still delivering items that should be there upon check in, like robes, towels, etc There is not a coffee pot like in every other hotel room in the 1st world, no one gets to call... Wait... And then call back to find out what's taking so long. I'm from Seattle, we don't wait for coffee!Sure it looks nice, it's in Sedona, but if the service doesn't support your ambience then you're an overpriced place to avoid. (like having a ""W"" Hotel in Apache Junction) Now we will return to Chandler, AZ. We'll get with our bike &amp; running friends and we will tell them how my birthday was. Save the place we stayed. On that note, your website is impressive!We won't be investigating any other Kimpton locations.My husband and I went to Sedona overnight and we stayed at the Amara.  We had a wonderful room that overlooked Oak Creek.  Our room was amazing - two bathrooms (one was a powder room), the other had an awesome Jacuzzi tub, a living room area, large bedroom with a king-sized bed, snacks, water, drinks, an in-room coffee maker, and three (yes, 3) balconies.  They have a happy hour (complimentary wine) -- we took ours out to the outdoor seating area which looks out towards the mountains. Even though it's June, it had just rained and was cooling off so the fire pits were going.  It was so pleasant to sit around the fire pit, talk and enjoy a glass of wine.  Everyone was super friendly and helpful. Service was exceptional. We'll definitely go back!We visited Sedona in March of this year and only ended up booking at the Amara because most other places were sold out and I am so glad it happened this way! Everyone who helped us that trip was so incredible, so naturally, when we got 5 days to come back to Sedona, this time Amara was our first choice! Each night, their complimentary wine hour begins at 5 p.m. and ends at 6 p.m. This is a great time to enjoy a few glasses of wine, meet a few new folks, play a game of scrabble or tic-tac-toe in the comfortable lobby. Other options include enjoying the breathtaking red rock views outside in the courtyard, or sitting by the fire outside the SaltRock restaurant. They have huge ""connect 4"" style games in the courtyard, and also a large beanbag game. It is perfect to keep you busy and engaged! We had a great time playing these games. Each night, we met new folks and now have new friends! Each staff member who served the wine each night was always incredibly friendly and open and full of great ideas to share! The gentleman who set up the wine hour in March was the same gentleman who was setting up and breaking down the wine hour this time also, and he is just fantastic! He is an incredible employee, always doing whatever it takes to make the guests feel welcome and happy! We enjoyed the complimentary yoga classes with Cathleen both stays! We were so happy to know she was still here when we returned last week! She is truly a wonderful yoga instructor and really inspires you to want to live life more peacefully! Her optimism and happiness is contagious and you just leave class feeling incredibly grateful and inspired.... They offer a complimentary shuttle to anywhere within a mile of the hotel. We didn't know this until half way through our stay this time. This is an awesome option and would highly recommend it as a means for sober dinner transportation after the wine hour! We made dinner reservations for Mariposa and got a ride there (and back) from Amara's free shuttle service! (They give you a business card to call when you're ready to be picked up and were there in less than 10 minutes). Awesome service and excellent drivers!!! The men running the valet (and holding the doors) were all, always fantastic! Always prompt and friendly service!  Love them and their stories about how they ended up in Sedona and at the Amara. The hotel smells great! Only wish I knew what the scent was, because I so want it in our home!  They always have fruit-infused ice water in the lobby, and depending on the time of day, either coffees/teas, or build-your-own trail mix.... Yum! The entire hotel is pet-friendly, no breed or weight restrictions. Have yet to see any issue with this. All dogs have been great, no animal waste anywhere, no loud barking, no pet smells lingering.... However they do it, it works! They even have dog bowls, food and beds for free if you decide to bring your little buddies along. Out behind the hotel, there is a peaceful little creek. If you walk out to that creek and head right, you will walk over to L'Auberge de Sedona on your own little dirt path and that restaurant has awesome creek-side dining. Sometimes, the terrace is closed but even the views from inside were fantastic. Service and food there were both great as well. We spent about an hour or so, watching 4 river otters swim and fish and play. There are comfortable chairs and bench swings to enjoy the sounds of the rushing water and happy ducks. It is really its own little hidden treasure out back. There are also dvd rentals available, as well as awesome spa amenities and a fitness center, but we didn't take advantage of these this trip. I highly recommend the courtyard or creek view rooms. We loved having first floor, courtyard, because we could walk off patio to pool, courtyard, restaurant, creek.... It was another fantastic time! Would absolutely recommend this to ANYONE heading to Sedona, as it is completely worth the money!We stayed here for our wedding and I wouldn't have changed a thing. The next time we are in Sedona, The Amara is a MUST! They made sure every detail of our stay was perfect. They have impeccable customer service and their restaurant is phenomenal! We can't wait to go back and visitThe Amara in Sedona is the greatest place in the world. It is my version of Heaven. My husband and I were married at the creek behind the hotel three years ago, and continue to come back several times a year. I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. They know how to do it. Below are a few of the highlights: 1) views: The hotel has the most incredible views of Sedona. I have stayed in several rooms in the hotel and everyone is top notch with a great view. 2) The staff: Everyone there is so awesome, helpful and kind-Best customer service!!!3)The food: Dang! Just Amazing food!4) The pool! This is the only hotel that knows how to do the pool right! They make it so relaxing and amazing! Its so amazing because they don't have a dj and base music playing like all the other hotel pools, they ensure the tranquility of Sedona. The most relaxing place in the world. I highly recommend staying at this hotel. It is the only hotel that we stay at, and our favorite hotel to vacation of any place that we vacation!The Location: Keep your GPS on to find this place. The ""street"" that it is on looks like a small driveway from the road, and their sign by the road is quite small. We would have passed it if we didn't have the GPS on. You drive down this long, windy drive to the hotel, which has a great view of some of the red rocks for which Sedona is famous. It's like a secret. I like the way it is nestled away.The Hotel: I wouldn't really call this a resort, but the ""resort fee"" does include valet parking, which is well worth the price ($22/day I think). The set-up is a little awkward (you can only get upstairs using the stairs or elevator at one end, and not at the other; the hallways are broken up so that you have to open doors repeatedly to get down the hall - going outside and then back in), but all the rooms are on one side or another of the inner courtyard, which has large cozy chairs, fire pits, the pool and the hot tub and an incredible view. It's a pet-friendly hotel, so you'll get to see and meet a bunch of dogs (which is great for dog-lovers like myself). It's a Kimpton, so you get the Kimpton perks like a daily wine hour and free wifi.The Room: The room was big and on the ground floor facing the pool and the hot tub, which was tremendously convenient when we wanted to use those facilities. The closet was also very big. There were plenty of windows, including three cute little square ones, and the large patio door. The decor was very cute. The beds were comfortable, too. The room came with two robes, which came in handy when we wanted to go to the pool.There were a few details that were overlooked, though. There were not enough hooks in the bathroom, and there was no towel bar for a hand towel by the sink. We improvised, but they could fix this easily. The shower/tub faucet is strange and not intuitive. I had to fiddle with it for a few minutes to figure out how it worked (It turns one way for the tub, the other way for the shower, and an inner knob controls the temperature of the water). Also, the closet doors were awkward &amp; the lighting switch for the closet was next to the mini-bar. It just didn't make sense. Also, they only had one yoga mat and one umbrella in the room. You can get extra ones by calling the front desk. Also, we were on the ground floor, and our upstairs neighbors were running around at 4am the first night of our stay. They were maddeningly loud. I wish the hotel would advise guests about quiet hours and having guests below them.The Restaurant/Bar: Saltrock. Their menu is quite limited, and I don't think they offer breakfast except for in-room dining. It says their focus is ""Craft Margaritas,"" but they only had a handful of margaritas on the menu. El Passion was really great. Spicy &amp; sweet. We ordered the guacamole even though it is, by far, the most expensive guacamole I've ever ordered. It was this strange ""make your own"" guac concept that was interesting (you add tomatoes/jalapenos/cilantro/mango) to your own taste to some avocado pulp. It needed onions. I would have preferred some really good guacamole without the gimmick.The Service: It was clear that they set our room up for us before we got there. They stocked the place with complimentary vegan, gluten-free treats, including cookies, rice chips and hummus. They left me a postcard welcoming me and explaining all of the goodies they left for me. Talk about service! We had some lighting issues, which were promptly fixed after we reported them. The bellmen were really nice, friendly and helpful, and always offered restaurant suggestions and tips. Basically everyone we met there (with rare exception) was incredibly nice and helpful. They put our stay over the top. The people really made the difference.The Spa: As a guest of the hotel, you can use the facilities at the spa, including the steam rooms (separated by gender), the relaxation lounge, and you can take their 8:30am yoga class, which is limited to 9 participants. You can sign up in advance (we signed up 2 days in advance), or just show up around 8:15am and wait to see if there are any no-shows. The Spa services are a little pricey, but not tremendously out of the ordinary. They have a long menu of services that can meet any of your needs. I got a facial for the first time, and my face is still glowing days later. Their robes are deliciously cozy, and they have basically every personal care product you would need.The most annoying thing was that their standard hair dryers (in the hotel rooms and in the spa) are so cheap. I should have asked them for a ""High Powered Hair Dryer."" I didn't even notice it on the list of complimentary items. I'm not sure why their standard hair dryers are so cheap, as the other Kimptons I've been to offer much better hair dryers. It took forever to dry my hair.Join Karma Rewards BEFORE you book your room and look for room specials. I wound up getting a cheaper rate that included two free hot toddies just by searching their website.Beautiful property in a beautiful setting. The room was very comfortable and clean overlooking the pool and red rocks. Breakfast, Dinner and wine hour were all excellent. Staff was very helpful with hiking information and directions when needed. My new go to hotel in Sedona.","This place is nestled from the main street. It's a little tricky finding it so make sure you watch your gps when finding the road. The place is cute. The decor lives up to the Kimpton standards, but there were things here and there that could be improved upon. The best part of this place was the service and staff. Everyone was very friendly and accomodating, from check-in to check-out. The room was ok. It was a little smaller than expected. The amenities were ok, they use Bigelow. The hair dryer was terrible (yes, this matters, at least to me). One thing that was bad was the temperature of the water. It never got hot enough even though it was turned to the hottest setting. The hotel property was nice. They had outdoor and indoor games available for the guests. They served coffee and tea in the morning and a happy hour (red/white wine and snacks) around 5. They also knew it was my birthday and left a bottle of champagne (with my name on it) waiting for us. I was really impressed by that. They also have the spa amenities available at no cost. They definitely have quite a few quirks compared to other places. One of my favorite things were the fire pits and seats with blankets (at night) available for the guests. I would recommend this property if people are looking for a place to stay in Sedona.This place is awful! First off the wait for dinner was 39 min when plenty of tables were open. They said only 2 servers where on but there were 4. The dinner was disgusting I got a pork belly dish and it was nachos with crap in it. The manager was a old 50 year old drunk with a side braid and couldn't tell one thing from the next.   Plus our room smells like a wet dog. Awesome. Not worth the money.The sweets are 5 star however I had to be down graded the second night. The normal room bathroom was tiny and the bathtub had a bunch of dings in it. If you don't have a coffee maker in the room offer coffee all day. Check in wasn't until four which kind of sucks and the restaurants food was just mediocre (they couldn't even cook a medium rare steak). The good, the grounds are gorgeous and the service is amazing. Everyone was outstanding. The rooms minus the bathroom were updated and clean. Overall for the price just average, hence the 3 stars. One last item, if you are paying a resort fee the valet should not accept a tip, probably my fault for offering but something that should be addressed.Not only is this a great resort but their staff is phenomenal. My sister and I stayed here one night and wished we would have stayed longer. We took advantage of their free happy hour from 5-6 and their free shuttle service to and from the hotel to one of the restaurants downtown. Such a lovely service and the staff were so friendly and cheerful. It's so nice to experience this kind of customer service and we really appreciated the way we were taken care of. Beautiful grounds, cozy and quaint rooms, and lovely views. I would recommend this place to anyone staying in Sedona.This is by far my favorite place to stay in Sedona. These beds should be standard in all hotels. Quiet, clean, right on the creek. I love being able to walk right up to the center of town. If your legs can't handle the hike the valet will drop you off or drive you to wherever you need to go. They already had my business before we found out they are a dog friendly hotel at no charge. Can't wait to visit again.It was my first time in Sedona and I loved it. In spite of the weather being colder/rainier than one would expect in Arizona, it was a great time. Chill vibe without compromising amenities. Overall really enjoyed the experience at Amara. Pros:- clean and good sized rooms- good amenities - coffee hour in the lobby in the morning- wine hour in the lobby in the evening- nice spa with good services- super friendly valets- pet friendly (I don't have a dog but love them and figured it was a helpful thing to point out!)- nice hot tub and infinity pool with a gorgeous viewCons:- concierges were not super knowledgeable and/or they simply weren't into helping out of towners. They seemed to expect us to know where we wanted to go vs. looking to then for recommendations. For instance: we asked about a hiking trail that would be fun but not super challenging for newbies and the response was ""ok which one?""- service was a little awkward in the restaurant like they were trying to rush us out even though there were plenty of open tables. Not exactly rude maybe just confusedWe were only here for one night but thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  There are many nice hotels in Sedona, I'm not sure why my hubby picked this one but I'm glad he did.  The location is great- right in the middle of uptown.  It's easy to miss the entrance but just drive slow and keep your eyes out for the Amara sign.  The decor is modern, our room was nice, no frills but large and clean.  We loved the gorgeous views of the red rocks from the restaurant and the pools.  The whole place felt like an oasis.  We also loved the coffee and hot chocolate bar in the morning, wine hour, and I LOVED the yoga class at the spa on Sunday mornings.First off, Sedona is an amazing destination. For the entire weekend I was there, I could only say, ""Wow."" The people in the town, locals and tourists are so amazingly polite and hospitable. Now onto the resort. I booked the Amara after reading reviews on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> and selecting it based upon the amenities, the view and the price. The purpose of the trip was to celebrate my anniversary with my girlfriend and the Amara did not disappoint.When booking, I had to call the hotel because I had a difficult time understand the room selections (you want to overlook the pool/courtyard). They were amazingly pleasant on the phone and supremely helpful. Right away, I had a great experience and I still had weeks to go before I stayed there.Some people say it's tough to find, but if you do your diligence and map it out, understand how the town works, it's not that tough to find. The road off of 89A is marked with their hotel sign and the road is even named Amara Road. We were greeted by the valet who was one of the better valets I've had experiences with, his name was Orlando and he was helpful the entire weekend. Valet is included in the resort fee, but don't forget to tip every time you want your car, it's just polite. We entered the resort to check in and the front desk staff knew enough to wish us a Happy Anniversary (because I mentioned it in the comments when booking). It was a great way to kick off the weekend. The resort is smaller than you think, but that's not a bad thing at all. You get to know the staff pretty quickly and you get to meet others who are staying there as well (all were very nice and open to talking). The heated pool is a little colder than you think, but the hot tub makes up for it.Entering the room, we were greeted with a bottle of wine and chocolate-covered strawberries. I didn't ask for those, they were a present from the resort and they were very welcome. Also, we had a handwritten note wishing us a happy anniversary. You don't find things like that anymore.The room walls are a bit thin and proximity to the courtyard is pretty close, but since you go out hiking all the time and out for dinner, you don't really notice.The view is spectacular as is the walk down by the creek. Check out the restaurant for brunch, but I recommend venturing out for dinner. Speaking of which, one thing to keep in mind about Sedona, everything closes in that town around 9pm, including nightlife - so plan accordingly.We will definitely be back and I will recommend this place to all my friends!I loved this hotel. Cant wait to go back to Sedona and stay here again.1. Great location - walking from the main street with restaurants2. Great service - there is a shuttle that will take you around a 1 mile radius and valet is included in the resort fee3. Welcome dogs happily! There are rooms that go right into the grass area to take them out potty (super plus!!!!)4. The room and resort was very nice and modern.I LOVE the setting, with the creek on the other side of the infinity pool. That was the highlight by far.  Room was nice, grounds were cool looking and framed the beautiful redrocks quite nicely.  Oh, and the valet guys...awesome. They hustle with a smile.  Can't say enough about them, and I think they all need a raise.  So courteous and helpful.  A couple things I would change 1) The woman who I first spoke with at the front desk after our 8 hour drive should not be there. I don't know her name, she is young and seemed like it was her first day everyday.  It's not just me, over the course of our stay I witnessed and overheard other guests have similar sentiments.  She needs to not be in the front, probably a very nice girl, just needs to have a different role.  2) Since you are so far away, you feel a bit trapped with the food situation.  There is no continental breakfast or snacks or anything, just very basic coffee early AM and wine before dinner.  There is room service from SaltRock, which is very good, just expensive.  I wish there was a continental breakfast or something in the morning. 3)Customer service is a bit off here.  I was so excited one night they advertised smores.  Cheesy I know, but fun nonetheless.  When I arrived, the woman running the Smores said, oh we're out of chocolate.  I was disappointed, and asked if there was any chocolate in the kitchen or anything.  She said no, and then laughed and just said, the kids took all of it.  Then, said, well, now i know for next time to buy more chocolate.  Ummm, then she walked away.  Look, I didn't NEED the chocolate, but customer service 101 would suggest that she apologize and then offer something, a voucher, another dessert, or something.  It's not like I'm staying at the Motel 8.This really might be my favorite hotel of all time.My boyfriend and I were on a group vacay with my two best friends and we got two rooms here for a slightly reduced rate. We went based on reviews and a friend of a friend's recommendation, and we felt like we struck gold.To be clear, this is pricier than a Hilton or Marriot, but the extra touches were so lovely and the time we spent there was so relaxing, I don't regret a penny.As we arrived, we were told valet was included in our stay - why thank you! Each of our couples was checked in and offered free yoga, and immediate openings for spa appointments. We were oriented to lovely extras such as coffee hour in the morning, wine hour in the evening, not only a great pool and hot tub but cabanas on the pool patio, and a shuttle up the hill and ""within a mile"" around town. We found our rooms to be tremendously lovely and plush. Both of our rooms had private balconies with seating, the washroom was phenomenally well appointed, and the room had a tranquil feeling. And our bed was magnificent! Our room, in particular, was so big that the four of us took to gathering in it, playing cards, making drinks, and relaxing.On our second day we realized that there was some kind of workshop taking place in the meeting room just a couple of doors down the hall from us. What's interesting about this is that we found out this was happening when we left our room and found a throng of people in the hall - from inside the room we couldn't hear it at all! That's some awesome soundproofing.We chose never to use the shuttle as walking up the hill and around town was part of our evening routine. (This hotel is lovely inside and out, and because it's down the hill, you feel you're far away from town, but in actuality it's 3 minute trek up the hill to go get coffee, food, or to just walk and window shop!) However, valet was always prompt and helpful (and we were happy to tip them for it). I also had a wonderful experience when I found that the second floor ice machine wasn't working (sounds weird I know) - I ran into hotel staff on my walk back from the defunct ice machine, told them, and he said ""just give me your room number and I'd be happy to send up two ice buckets!"" That's quality service right there.Checkout is luxuriously late, and they were FAST. I was a bit nervous about having pre-paid and then owing ""resort fees"" but it was really only $20 a day - I say that's money well spent for the level of service we got all over the hotel. I'd go back in a heartbeat.Nice Sedona resort.  Very warm and service oriented with fresh squeezed juices.  Very inviting and welcoming.  The rooms are not huge but well architected with interesting fixtures and decor.Loved this place! Close to shops in Sedona, pretty view, fun games outsides such as corn hole, giant connect 4 &amp; jenga, lemon infused water for guests that was perfect for the heat, and cute trail mix bar and hot cocoa bar. I loved the details. I recommend this hotel if you are visiting Sedona.Great Hotel , solid service, new rooms. Centrally located - but in the valley not the best view. Overall a solid experience.We stayed at the Amara for one night with our dog, Annie. The hotel is actually fairly small when you get inside. The courtyard area at the center of the building is very nice. Although pretty, be warned that the ""red rock view"" is just the center courtyard. The bathroom was ok, but the shower had a strange shower control that we figured out by accident. Everyone was very friendly to our dog which was very nice. There's not a lot of areas for your pet to relieve themselves. The hotel is segregated into sections, so walking through 4-5 sets of doors to get to our section was a bit annoying with a pet in tow. Everything closes at 9pm and the bar at 10pm, which was disappointing to find out on a Friday night when we got in at 8:30pm. The staff was nice to you, but not really personable. They felt cold and we were ignored at the restaurant more than once. For the price, I feel like we had been a bit jipped.I mainly chose Amara because of their pet policy, but I'm glad I went regardless of pet or not. First the rooms are huge and I felt that the fair is very reasonable.The stay at Amara was a breeze and I would definitely go back as it was so nice to be able to walk through downtown Sedona.Pros:-Free valet-Very accommodating to pets -Coffee in the lobby in the morning, and wine in the afternoon! -Variety of spa services even in room massages-Ideal location in downtown Sedona-Great pool outside and fire pits to snuggle close to.Cons:-As others have mentioned, you have to pay for wifi-There is a $20 fee per day, I can see why some wouldn't like it, but I didn't mindOverall I very much enjoyed Amara. Their restaurant near the lobby was okay and they have live music at night which is pretty nice.Centrally located but set back from the main road.  ""Downtown"" sedona is easily accessible by walking however the hotel offers a free shuttle to/from locations within a 1 mile radius which we used extensively.  Awesome views in a serene setting, excellent service and a restaurant that can get very crowded on weekends. The rooms are pretty much as shown in the pictures - clean and comfortable.  I'd return.We absolutely loved our stay at Amara. Located right in the heart of Sedona, this resort was a great find. Our favorite aspects were the spacious rooms, accommodating staff and the spa. I recommend Joy as massage therapist. They also have a free wine tasting from 5p-6p (woot woot) and a free coffee, tea and hot chocolate bar in the morning. The restaurant SALTROCK is top notch as well. We will be back frequently.I would definitely come back.  Sony DVD player was broken in my room but that was the only minor glitch I experienced during my stay.  This property is located in uptown Sedona which has plenty of shopping, and dining options well within walking distance.Nice view of the sunrise from the swimming pool, patio, and restaurant.I just had the 2 worst nights sleep of my life. Whatever you do, don't let them put you in room 101. It's next to some machine room. I can sleep through anything, except whatever is humming and whirling and rotating in this room. Totally ripped off unfortunately and not worth the money. Not a 4 star experience by any account.","We did Sedona right by staying at the Amara. 5 star service despite the 4 star ranking.Booking:I joined the Karma Rewards program and booked at the 20% off new customer rate through the website.  Great rewards program, lots of awesome perks as they really go the extra mile by being a boutique hotel.  Free WiFi as a rewards member too.PS - This hotel loves dogs and I love that they do (I would have brought mine if we weren't staying up at the Grand Canyon for a night).Arrival: The friendly bellman parked our car and offered to carry our bags.  We arrived right at wine hour (complimentary wine from 5-6pm).  So, we dropped off our bags and put on our swim suits, grabbed a glass of red wine, and plunged into the hot tub.   Upon our return to the room I noticed a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberry's (my boyfriend and I were celebrating a late valentines day).  This was SO lovely and thoughtful!!! We went down to the restaurant bar for a margarita - I am extremely picky about my margaritas (do not put orange juice in my lime margarita, and REAL lime juice, please).  The bartender made a perfect margarita.Room Service:We ordered room service that night two minutes after the cut off time (an early 10pm or so?), but thankfully they excepted our order.Day 1: The bellmen told us about some hiking trails - we hiked Bear Mountain which took us 4 hours and it was terrific! We had a late dinner in the upper Sedona village at a Mexican restaurant - I think it may have been open 24/7 which was cool.Day 2:Check out was quick and easy.  We walked over to the neighboring hotel and had the most delicious brunch right on the river.Thanks for the amazing stay, Amara! The small service touches truly went a long way for us.My husband and I stayed here for our 5-year anniversary with our two dogs. We loved it! Pros: -Free Yoga in the spa every day at 8:30 am. Make sure to get there early, because the yoga room is very small. It only fits about 6 people comfortably, but can squeeze 10 side by side. -Free Breakfast Beverage Bar from 5-10 am, which includes coffees and teas. -Free Wine every night from 5-6 pm. -Free shuttle to local Sedona attractions.-Free Chapstick, deodorant, tweezers, and other beauty essentials, in case you forgot. Notice a trend here? I love free stuff!!! Cons: -You have to pay for Wifi. Wah wah. -This is a dog friendly hotel, but there is no designated dog relief area. We found a gravel area in the back, but it wasn't well lit. Overall, a great experience! It's in walking distance from Uptown Sedona, so you have access to lots of shopping. My husband signed us up for a loyalty program, and we got a free $10 credit towards the mini-bar. And on top of all that, they gave us complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to celebrate the occasion.From the moment we stepped on property, the valet and front desk staff were great. Our room was very nice and our creek side view was stunning. The patio and pool have an amazing red rock view that really can't be beat.We had dinner on the patio and the food was great! The hostess was a little eccentric and wanted to chat with patrons more than she wanted to seat guests. The live guitar music was a great touch. Our waiter was very nice but seemed a little stretched thin as they appeared to only have two servers working the entire restaurant. So we waited a while for our check, luckily we were sans kids and not in a hurry.Overall, a great stay and we'd stay again!This is not a 4 star hotel...My boyfriend and I celebrated our seven year anniversary here and we could not have had a better experience. We both work and are in school and so we didn't get in until around 9 pm. Since the restaurant was closed, the bartender helped us order pizza and gave us a round of free drinks. When we went up to our room, we found out that the concierge left a lovely plate of chocolate covered strawberries and a card for us. The resort itself is beautiful and all of the amenities there are definitely worth the extra price. I went to the free yoga class the first day and we both really enjoyed the free wine hour in the afternoon. It is also really convenient to have a free valet.With exceptional staff, a fabulous location, and beautiful views, the resort is without-a-doubt my first choice hotel in Sedona. We will definitely be back!Maybe I'm a bit spoiled, but the Amara was a bit ""meh."" The valets were super friendly and helpful, but the front desk staff needs help. They are friendly in a robotic way, but not in a thoughtful way. For instance when I asked about yoga class times, I was not told there was a sign up sheet. I found the signup sheet by happenstance and by that time the class I wanted was full. There are no ""grounds"" per say, it's a very pool-centric hotel-everything faces the pool and the pool has a weird vibe. There are the hotel pool crashers who arrived by canoe each day with their baby in tow--he had on those swimmy diapers that I find a bit revolting (they don't work, hello poop-in-the-pool. Google it-gross!) And the pool attendant refused to clear off the deck chairs and used glasses when people left so it was unclear which lounge chairs were taken and which were not. I watched people show up to the pool and look around at all of the wet towels on the chairs and lounges and leave although some of those chairs had been vacant for hours. When we asked for more towels, the attendant told us ""housekeeping takes care of that."" After about 45 min of no new towels, someone else loudly asked for towels and housekeeping was finally summoned. We've been to Kimpton hotels before, but this one was decidely lower end, the rooms are small, the decor so-so. The welcome wine hour was okay. Wines were predictably not good, so it was a good thing we brought our own. During the yoga class I did take, the yoga teacher began by telling us how off-put she was that she had to give up her spot since two people had signed up for one slot and the class was too full. She lectured us on honesty and taking others into consideration. Then she told us to get in touch with ""joy"" and proceeded to lead a non-yoga joy, healing, vibrational Sedona-New-Agey meditation class and in the midst announced that she loved all of us. WTF?Don't get a bottom floor room because although the floor is carpeted, but thin and you can hear the people above you walking around at all hours. Pricey for what you get. The restaurant Hundred Rox got so-so reviews so we steered clear. We had dinner at the lovely L'Auberge next door (delicious!) so if you want a resort get-away, I'd suggest staying there, the grounds at L'Auberge were fabulous and service was high-end and outstanding. And the food was truly amazing. THAT is a resort, the Amara, not so much.We spent 4 nights and chose this resort because of its close proximity to shops/restaurants in Uptown.  The resort is beautiful and our room located on the Creekside had a wonderful view with a balcony and was very quiet.  It was spacious as well  with a nice modern decor.  The staff was great, and the wine hour every night from 5-6pm was a nice touch! It gave us a chance to spend some time on the patio, watch the sunset and unwind before dinner.  We also had dinner on the patio one evening and it was wonderful!  Great stay!We absolutely loved the Amara.I booked after reading the reviews for my boyfriend's birthday and we came into town around check in time. It was January, and a bit cold, but they had the heaters going and it was really lovely.It is a quick turn in to the driveway/road and we did miss it the first time around, so circled back.Once we pulled in, we chose to valet as it just seemed easier. The check in was flawless. They had upgraded us to a pool (courtyard) facing room and wished my boyfriend a happy birthday as we checked in. (I had put down in the reservation that the occasion was for his b-day). When we got to our room, there was a set up of 2 plates and a card that again wished him happy birthday and said to check in the mini-fridge which had a plate of petit fours for us. It was such a nice touch. The room was decent sized with a king sized bed, a walk in closet, a stocked fridge and toiletry area (everything is for sale, nothing is free....), and a clean modern feel. Our room had a sliding door to a little patio area which would be cute to enjoy with wine if we had been staying there longer.The bathroom was small, with a good deep tub. The walk in closet was such a great touch since we had our winter wear with us. We took the complimentary shuttle up to the end of the shopping area and walked back to the hotel. The gal at the front desk had told us to look for the stairs behind the stores to get us back down to the hotel without having to take the curving driveway down. As we walked down, we passed a pretty landing with a lookout point, further down an area where they no doubt host weddings, and finally passed the spa which we did have some access to, but never used.We ventured to the lobby for our wine happy hour, and my boyfriend ordered a hot toddy which is also a choice while I had a glass of the merlot. It was either that or chardonnay. We lounged in the small area they have set up where you can play with a giant jenga set or connect4. We played a game of connect4 then decided to venture out by the pool. The one unfortunate thing was there are a few gas fire pits, but because it was cold, people seemed to ""hog"" them and had been there for hours. It was so cold outside, that we weren't really able to sit out there. We had asked for a heater for the table we were at, but they were all out of propane in the two that were available so we gave up and headed back to our room for a nap instead.We had reservations at the restaurant there for that evening. I had wanted to try Ken's Creekside, but the convenience of the hotel made it a simple decision.I will write a separate review for the restaurant. Over dinner, we decided we wanted to beat the crowds and get out on a 4 wheel drive adventure at sunrise, so we verified that our truck would be ready at 6:30 AM and then headed off to bed. (Oh the times of bars and all nighters have changed...)At 6:30 AM my boyfriend headed over to the lobby while I finished layering my clothes for the cold and when I got up there, the truck was ready and warm, and there was a nice coffee spread out in the lobby with a few different choices including hot tea and hot chocolate. The staff was up and chipper for so early in the morning.When we returned from the off-roading trip, we were no longer boyfriend and girlfriend, but engaged, which was a happy surprise to me. My soon-to-be husband decided to pop the question out on a gorgeous plateau during sunrise in Sedona, and we ate at Ken's Creekside for breakfast to celebrate.The pool area at Amara, while small, is truly gorgeous too, with a walk in infinity pool that looks like a sand beach, and chaise lounges everywhere. I had seen the setup for a wedding on the artificial grass behind it and thought what a magnificent place to be married. Quaint, quiet, beautiful and the nicest staff.I hope we get to go again, next time as husband and wife!I would highly recommend the Amara. It may not be a Four Seasons, but for the price, it really is lovely.This is just and AMAZING Resort! Wife and I were here to celebrate her Birthday and they had balloons and strawberries and nice card waiting inside the amazing room with balcony looking at oak creek. Just a wonderful Resort!Amazing hotel in a perfect location. The rooms are big with nice patios. Service is awesome. Beautiful pool with couches and beds surrounding the pool area. Fireplaces outside with a beautiful patio for lunch or dinner. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Sedona.Amara was such an amazing hotel, especially for the price. My boyfriend and I stayed there over 4th of July weekend. The valet guys were spectacular. They were more knowledgeable about hikes and things to do than the front desk women. Although the pool was small, the view of Snoopy Rock and Oak Creek is spectacular. The hotel restaurant is great too! Get a room on the 2nd floor and be sure to order the shrimp scampi or shrimp mango nachos. Also, the bar makes the best bloody marry I've ever had!!You can read all about Sedona and the best places to go somewhere else, but for those who want to stay in a clean, wonderful hotel, with a good view, AND you can take your dog - this is the place.Spending the week in Arizona for my birthday and the Amara was our first stop. The grounds are well kept and beautifully decorated with a mix of modern furniture and art and relaxing spots to hang out. The rooms were clean, and offered a ton of snacks and toiletries in case you forgot anything. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. I went for a massage today and had Derek who was awesome. I am a hairstylist so to say I have tight muscles is an understatement. I frequently get massages and have been serviced by a male massage therapist multiple times but I have to say, Derek was beyond professional and I was able to truly relax and not feel awkward during the massage. In the past i've always felt just slightly tense, nervous that a sheet or towel would expose certain parts during the service. With Derek, the sheets were always tucked so I felt confident that they wouldn't move. At one point during the abdominal massage (which was a first for me and it was amazing! You never realized you're tense in your tummy till someone rubs it haha) he even doubled up the towel and sheet so I would be comfortable. Also, the pressure was perfect, and I felt like a new person walking out of that room. Just wanted to thank all the staff and spa staff for a smooth, great start to my birthday trip! You will be referred to everyone I speak too:):)Had a wonderful stay! Will go back and stay there when I can. Salt-water infinity pool was a hit with my 10 year old and view was spectacular. Great downtown stay but the hike up to the main road is pretty steep.I love this resort. I stayed here a couple days &amp; it was absolutely beautiful!!! The view of bell mountain from the spa and heated infinity pool is awesome!!! So relaxing. Everyone was so friendly from the valet to the front desk people, bartenders &amp; cleaning staff. They are also dog friendly and you don't have to pay extra for your pet. I would gladly stay here again and the resort is also walking distance to downtown. Highly recommend!Friendly &amp; helpful staff, amazing views from courtyard, free wine hour, fairly comfortable rooms (though beware of the thick duvet unless you like sweating in your sleep), the quickest valets in all of Northern Arizona. Highly recommend.Not only was the place beautiful but the staff was so friendly and helpful. We especially loved this woman at the front desk named Julie! She was so friendly and helpful and is just a great person. She was warm and really helped us on our stay when it came to all the questions we had. The spa facilities are great, take advantage of the steam room and the hot tub is beautiful as well. What an amazing experience and they brought anything to the room we wanted, like a razor that we forgot! Great experience and loved Julie! thanks for the great stay! We also went to the restaurant for dinner. A little pricey but delicious. also we had the ""S'mondae"" - a mix between a S'more and a Sundae, AMAZING! a must try! beautiful location and friendly staff!Boutique hotels can be so hit or miss. So often the focus is on things that really don't matter to me, with the result being a lack of attention where it counts. Not so here. Amara seems to have dialed in a level of comfort and service that, for the price I scored, is a great deal. I paid around $200/night (including taxes and such) for a well-appointed room facing the parking lot. Super comfy king bed, flatscreen, subtle design, tub, balcony and the standard amenities you'd expect from a 4-star (in the classic sense) hotel. Also included in a $20 ""resort fee"" that I prepaid is valet parking, wi-fi, in-room water bottles (!) and a few other amenities that most chain hotels still think should be sources of income. I can't tell you how annoying it is to stay in a hotel paying upwards of $200/room and be asked to pay $15/day for wifi. That's bullshit. Not here. The facility itself is quite nice, with a courtyard looking out over an infinity pool and incredible red rock scenery. Interior it's well-decorated and has some common areas for chilling out. I didn't really eat at the restaurant but I can tell you the drink prices at the bar are a total rip (+$3 or more on average per pour of spirits than it should be). That said, bar staff are plenty friendly. In fact, all the staff here is 100% on point. Great customer service all around. Especially the valets, who have a cooler full of free water bottles. Again, the little niceties that other hotels try to nickel and dime you with come as part of the package here, which is proper when you're paying premium for the rooms. In fact, originally I was going to drop a 4-star on this place but as I think back to the comfort, style, and customer service I experienced here, I have to say, it's worth a few extra bux.Friendly valet and breezy check-in, we were told that the hotel would be only 30% full, so why do we get a room overlooking a parking lot? I called ahead to hotel about the pool, I was told it was open year-round at a temp. of 75*. Not on our 3 day stay. We were told by an employee that it had been down for over 3 weeks! Not acceptable! After hikes you want to come relaxin a pool, it is called a resort/spa. Oh, and we tried to get massages, we were told nothing was available, what a joke.ROOM: Broken media chair, closet light switch in the opposite closet, broken toilet paper holder and NO soap or shampoo. I called for soap, they brought ONE (we have a shower and a sink) The towels were not spa soft, more like sandpaper.HOTEL: Dirty carpets throughout, really needs a refresh.When I called ahead about pool I was told that the ""resort"" offered free valet parking. When you get the bill you are charged $20. a day for a ""resort fee"". RESTAURANT: Very nice service, however the food is lackluster. The shrimp wellington is horrible! My steak was ok but the sides were uneatable. Overall good service and location. Nice complimentary am coffee and 5-6 wine reception. The overall amenities were very lacking, I would not call this a spa/resort.Very nice room, food, pool and atmosphere. You can walk past the pool and down the stairs to the beautiful creek. You can also walk along the creek to the next hotel and they have a wonderful outside lounge and a high end restaurant as well. For some great exercise walk up the stairs to the main road.","What a great hotel! Reasonable rates for the weekend as well as great perks. They typically have a code word on their Facebook page and when you say it they bring you a bottle of champagne to the room, what a nice touch. We also have two very large dogs which they gladly allowed us to bring. The rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly. I love the happy hour. Enjoy a glass of wine on them from 5pm-6pm every night. They also have a coffee and tea bar in the morning. The views are spectacular and it's worth the short walk down to the creek. We will certainly be staying here again!Beautiful property ... However I took Away a star due to the spa saying they ""request"" a 20% discount on their services.. You should never tell a client how much to tip. The food is alright ... Nothing special for the price . Love the pool ! Great scene !This resort has beautiful views off the back patio and from the restaurant.  The rooms are spacious and the bed was comfortable.  They serve free wine every evening to enjoy while checking out the view!  The food at their restaurant is very good and the service is nice as well.  I recommend you ask to be seated on the patio.  The only downside was the margaritas which need some work.I bought a 4-night package through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FPriceline.com&amp;s=a7fbdccf674e97746685dfb19eddf988696e5a62d38c815fc567f952b1c07748"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Priceline.com</a>. It turned out that the price would have been about the same if I had booked through the hotel directly, and Priceline would not let us modify the reservation once the cancellation deadline for the entire package has passed (we wanted to shorten the stay). So I will book directly through their website next time.The resort was very conveniently located with beautiful scenery as background. The Uptown area is a 2- minute (uphill) walk. Grand Canyon was about 3 hours drive, and we visited Antelope Canyon and Monument Valley on a different day (I wish we had an entire day at the Monument Valley, though).The staff was very friendly, and the service was great---free coffee/tea in the morning, free wine in the afternoon, free shuttle, free valet-parking, etc., (although these services are not technically free because $22.55 per day is added to the bill as a resort fee.) Wifi is free if you sign up for their InTouch membership (free to sign up). Overall we really enjoyed our stay here, and will be back. The only drawback was that the furnace was so loud.Stayed 2 nights in Jan. Location is great as right downtown. The reason for only 3 stars is this does not live up to Kimpton quality. Place needs a facelift which they told us is scheduled for June '14.  Plants were in need of serious tlc.Worth booking a room with view as our room felt like a dungeon.Staff is very responsive and good yoga class.Very nice experience despite a rough start.  We were here to celebrate two monumental occasions and were assured there would be a celebratory bottle of champagne, and ""a little something extra special"" waiting for us upon our arrival as we would not be arriving until after 10:00 p.m. and their bar would be closed.  Once in our room there was a lovely card saying enjoy the champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, only problem was there was no champagne!  After a phone call, a trip to the front desk, and many tears they were somehow able to procure the promised champagne, and to those involved I am very grateful!  From there on out it was an absolutely wonderful experience.We had a jacuzzi bath and king size bed overlooking a grassy knoll and fire pit area.  We only ate breakfast at the hotel, but on both occasions the food was very fresh and tasty, and the service was excellent.  The menu was a bit limited, but selection was nice. The saltwater pool was clean, as was the jacuzzi, and the wine happy hour was really a nice touch.  Definitely would stay here again, and would recommend it.  Don't have any negatives.Sitting here wishing I didn't have to leave today! Friendliest staff and the most beautiful scenery. Everyone went above and beyond to create a very special birthday getaway for me. The pool is amazing, and the creek is so romantic. Love love love. Will be back for sure.We stayed only one night on our way back from Flagstaff.  I'm a huge Kimpton fan and wanted to check this place out.Pros:- check-in and valet were great- good location (close to restaurants, shopping)- beautiful views of the red rocks- wine happy hour staff very good (as always)- lobby very nice- sitting in the courtyard in the late evening was divineCons:- our room reminded me of a upgraded ""motel"" (didn't get the usual Kimpton vibe)- we had to keep our patio door closed because of ""staff"" from the adjacent hotel constantly taking ""smoking"" breaks (ugh)Notes:- the pictures of the pool make is seem larger than what it really is- the best rooms appear to be the ones on the 2nd floor that overlook the pool- if you stay, don't eat at the restaurant there, take the short drive to Ken's Creekside and order the pork chop (best pork chop ever - dinner simply divine)I have never been to Sedona, AZ before, so really - any hotel would do, because we planned to be out everyday touring, hiking, and traveling to nearby attractions. So when I discovered the Amara Resort, I felt it would be adequate for the needs of my stay. Amara turned out to be a vacation in and of itself. The chambermaids left lovely notes in our room every day when they came in to clean. Meanwhile, we were treated to a free coffee/tea/hot chocolate bar every morning, complete with the NY Times. When we initially checked in, our room was not ready yet and the concierge presented us with free Margaritas at the hotel's bar. When we decided to have dinner at their restaurant, Salt Rock, we found out that there was a free wine hour with entertainment from 5-6 p.m. every evening of our stay. When we complimented the food to the waiter, he brought back the chef who explained how the dish was prepared and offered to email us the recipe. The resort was so beautiful that we didn't even think to check out the spa until the last day. Boy, were we annoyed at ourselves when we realized that the spa offered complimentary yoga classes twice each morning. On top of all of this, the doormen and valets never failed to give us advice about the general surroundings and the free use of the shuttle service to a wide radius of restaurants and local attractions. If you're planning a trip to Sedona, AZ - do not hesitate to reserve Amara Resort as your place to stay. You will not be disappointed!Great location! Right behind  downtown area and next to creek on the other side. .. beautiful! Rooms are great!  Creekside or courtyard rooms have the best view. Front desk I'd very helpful and they are also pet friendly...no breed restrictions and no extra charge! Would definitely stay here again!This hotel appears to be recently re-branded, it seemed to have been ""freshed up"". It had a lot of modern looking furnishings and seemed very clean. The pool is beautiful and looks directly over Oak Creek as well as some of the infamous red rock mountains. There is also a large grassy area right outside from the bar that has a lot of chairs and even cushions to lay on during the day and at night which was really nice and a good place to relax. The resort allows dogs, and doesn't have a weight limit, which was really nice, as long as you have a well behaved dog.The staff was very friendly and helpful when it came to giving us rides to restaurants and suggestions on places to go and things to do. Only complaint would be that the bar closes really early, however that seems to be a city wide trait, not just this resort, at least in the touristy area.Stayed August 2014, traveled as a coupleI stayed at the Amara Resort and Spa four three nights and four days. I pre-paid my stay when making my reservation, it was $400/ a night. I have stayed at other Kimpton properties but this is by far the worst experience I have had. I would start with the fact that the hotel is hard to find --- a very narrow road which leads to the lobby. They have valet only. No self-park available at all. I am here for business and having to call for my car as I am in and out of the hotel is not only annoying but time consuming. My room, Room 205 has a great view of the parking lot with a balcony. The sheets are the worst I have slept on with a thread count so low it's probably shameful to print. Not what I would expect for $400/night. The air in the room is difficult to regulate and the closet is awkward with the in room safe pretty much at the floor level. The air conditioning in the room is so loud when on it requires on to turn the television up quite loud to hear it over the roar. When you look online you will see the beautiful pool.... I couldn't use it as it was continuously crowded by families with tiny children splashing about. I would like to remind them this is a resort &amp; spa ---- there was no tranquility when I could spend time by the pool as it was like a Disney resort. I decided after realizing I would not be able to use the pool a nap would be nice. But the housekeeping staff came back to my room three times on Saturday after they had cleaned it. They forgot one of the glasses in the bathroom, then later to change the towels again? Why? they were changed when they cleaned it in the early morning at 9:00am. If I had no pre-paid for this over priced hotel I would have checked out after the first day.I cannot say enough about our stay at this resort. Everything from the best location, to the views, the hospitality, the food, the vibe, and the stellar guest service was incredible. April, the PR woman that served wine during wine hour from 5-6pm every night, was so endearing and genuine. The views from our room were captivating. The staff were so helpful, inviting, and cordial. I would stay here ten times over, well worth every penny.Anniversary trip.Loved this place.Service, attention to detail, atmosphere, scenery and location were fantastic.Would stay again without question!Stayed here while they were going through renovation so there was no pool and no gym.  If you go to breakfast here, you're also treated to a pretty view of the red rocks and the big hole where the pool once was.However, service and accommodations were very nice.  The rooms are clean, the towels plentiful, and toiletries were above average.  I especially liked the unlimited Crystal Geyser water they make available for guests.  The only complaint I have with the space is that the walls and floors are very thin - so I could hear my neighbor's children screaming through the walls at 7am.They offer a daily complimentary yoga class to guests.  Be sure to sign up a day or 2 in advance as the classes are often full if you try to sign up the night before.The location is great - surrounded by the beautiful backdrop of dramatic, red-tinged rocks and mountains (are they considered mountains? I don't know). And it's walking distance from a lot of stores &amp; dining &amp; ice cream options.  Walking to the shops is straight uphill, but thankfully it's not far, should take less than 5 min.Our rooms were clean and had a flat-screen TV. The air conditioning worked well.There's complimentary valet parking.There's a spa attached, and they offered a complimentary yoga class every morning.I guess the only downside is that it's expensive.We stayed here for two nights during a lovely weekend in September. The service was wonderful, the staff as far as front desk, wait staff, valet service, housekeeping were all friendly and great. The location is very convenient, centrally located to the main shops and restaurants in Sedona. Nevertheless they offer complimentary shuttle service to anywhere within a mile at the snap of your fingers! The drivers were great and also gave us extra tips on the area.  There are so many great hikes within miles of the resort.As far as the food, we had two meals at the resort. Dinner was really nice outside with all the stars, the warm breeze, the live pianist/singer. We had the french onion soup and the burger which were both good. The Breakfast we had really hit the spot for my craving of banana pancakes. I'd been craving them for a week now and was unsatisfied somewhere in boston the previous weekend, but this was it! They have also have a free wine hour from 5-6pm. We got a creekside room, ooooooh la la, which had a balcony over the creek and was enveloped by trees. I loved it... it was so serene to sit out there and fulfilled my desire to have a naturesque getaway... despite staying at a man-made resort....  I want my future home balcony to be identical. Well, minus the cicadas. The only only downside I would say is it's not as ""resort-like"" as I imagined. I have only stayed at a resort in Palm Springs and maybe the two cities aren't comparable, but  the room was smaller, the resort was much smaller, though enjoyable for a weekend. The room is clean, with a california king bed, huge shower/tub.IF ever you get a chance to visit Sedona, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stay here!!! It was an amazing experience! The fact that it's a resort AND spa should be enticing enough...and the spa is just a small part of the entire property! The views are amazing...Sedona is ridiculous in its beauty...and the outside lounging areas are many with a great pool for relaxation. We were there in December right after Christmas and it was still warm enough to enjoy an afternoon dip in the pool when the sun was still out. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant for dinner, but enjoyed a very nice nice cap complete with some local bites (cactus, rattlesnake...which was good!) Our room was merely steps from the pool but was still very quiet and beautiful. I would happily stay at this resort again and again--and especially when the weather is even better than it was! It is a quick drive through some of the best desert country from PHX to Sedona, and once you're there, you feel very relaxed...and the Kimpton staff makes all that possible.I had some trouble printing something at the concierge computer, but the staff helped me resolve it and refunded my room the charges, which was a very nice courtesy. We also utilized the shuttle to get to and from the shopping area which is just up the hill but it's a H I L L, so better to use the shuttle and not be out of breath at the top :)BEAUTIFUL place to visit and relax. DO ITJust finished a bachelorette weekend here with my girlfriends and we had the best time! The staff was amazing and the resort is very well kept! The pool has an amazingly beautiful back drop and the town is so cute! Will definitely have to go back for a romantic weekend with my love!Beautiful property that has a small trail to sit by the river and listen to nature!! Great pool, nice rooms, and excellent service - will definitely return. Morning's they have yoga that's included with a fabulous instructor.  Went straight to the sauna and then in for a spa treatment; amazing.    This place has awesome views, is within walking distance to shopping district, and great food in their restaurant. Would definitely suggest the stay to anyone visiting Sedona.","['night', 'nothing', 'great', 'experience', 'location', 'great', 'staff', 'nice', 'food', 'good', 'room', 'nice', 'clean', 'nightly',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sky-ranch-lodge-sedona-2,Sky Ranch Lodge,4.0,$$,143,"We stayed at Sky Ranch for one night on our way down from the Grand Canyon. We checked in fairly quickly around 5pm. This place is located right across from the Sedona airport however there wasn't much traffic. The room keys are actual keys and not key cards. Our room at two queen beds and was very spacious. It has a microwave and desk. The bathroom is somewhat small. We had the ""garden view"" room which is a view similar to you walking out your front door. They have a private area so that guests can go watch the sunset and the view is amazing. I called the hotel to make my reservation after looking online at the different types of rooms they had on their website. The prices they quoted me over the phone was a little more expensive than what they quoted me over the phone. I was able to get a two queen bed room with garden view for $116. This was the price Expedia was offering (I compared prices after making the reservation) so I'm assuming that is why the girl on the phone offered me that price. She also mentioned that the pool area was closed for renovations and that she wanted me to be aware of that. We stayed here in February on a Sunday.I didn't go into the wine area because it was so cold but I don't believe they serve food here.Sedona is beautiful. My boyfriend and I took our first trip ever to the city (and for me, the state), and really enjoyed the scenery. It was an altogether bummer that the weather didn't cooperate (we traveled to escape the MN cold only to experience a snowy Arizona), but vacation is vacation and we were happy for the change of scenery. The reason I chose one star for this lodge is because I am SO disappointed with the staff. This stay was not cheap, and we were informed that the hot tub is under construction. This was our vacation--a splurge. We would not have chosen this place to stay if the resort would have had this information listed anywhere on their website. I brought this up to the front desk to get our bill adjusted, and he said (unapologetically) that they were unable to do anything because we purchased through a booking site.I then brought up that they really need to put this information on their website to inform others so this doesn't happen again, and they said it is up there. Later that night I searched the site again (and took screen shots)--there was nothing listed. I'm disappointed in my stay here because of the construction and lack of enthusiasm from the staff to realize this disappointment, but I'm MAD that they're not making an effort to avoid this debacle again. It appears that they know less people will stay if they have this information, so they keep it to themselves. Happy Vacationing.Nice location, good view, friendly and informative staffs, big room.........    Those were the first impressions about this hotel.  However here i am giving one star for the following reasons:Number one.  I could not take a shower.  There was nice hot water for about 5 minutes and it was getting colder and colder and colder.  I had to jump out fromthe shower, having shampoo on my hair.  I called and office and a maintenanace guy came.  He said that because of small sized water tank, i need to take a quick shower.  I donot even have long hair.  Shower in 5 minites?  Is it a joke?Number two.  I could not sleep.  The fitted sheet of the mattress was wrong size.  I had to fix the fitted sheet three times per night.   Otherwise i had to sleep on dirty ( does look clean at all) mattress without any covering.   Paying more than $200 per night and no shower and no good night sleep.  I wont go back.No.Unless you're guaranteed a full rim view... actually, no. Still no.The check in process was slow and the workers were unfriendly. We were immediately told what we couldn't do and where we couldn't go. ""Don't go to the view area because it's closed for a private event."" ""The pool &amp; jacuzzi are closed."" etc.The garden view room ($160/night) had no view and no garden. It was near the ""wine bar"" which played loud radio music all night. The drawers in the room were broken. The bathroom was dirty. There was a weird spill/water stain on the night stand area that they didn't even try to hide. The fitted sheet was the wrong size so it wouldn't stay on the mattress. The room was DARK... maybe trying to hide the lack of cleanliness. I had to open the windows in the morning to get dressed. Awkward.You can't walk anywhere from the ""lodge"" as it's up high on a dark, windy road.No no no.My name is a Christina Cho and I was the photographer at a client's wedding at this venue in April of 2014!Where to start!?! The VIEW WAS BREATHTAKING!!!!!!  There was less than 50 people present. The ceremony FACED the RED ROCK!! People stopped on their way across the lawn JUST TO TAKE PHOTOS!! The day went by so smoothly. Chairs were set up, sun was beautiful, venue was private. It was everything we could ask for! Photos came out beautifully as well! Thank you so much for accommodating the bride and groom!Our family stayed there last summer. Great view but room is old. Overall- great experience. Also very close to the hiking trails and the view point by foot.Great location off the main road. Has a convenient lookout for a gorgeous view of the red rocks at sunset with a convenient parking lot right across the street. Checkin was quick  and efficient and they were able to accommodate an early check in for us at 1 pm instead of 4 pm. The room itself was fine. However we had a lot of issues with the plumbing and the toilet. First, the toilet still had stains and clearly hadn't been thoroughly cleaned. We called the front desk and this issue was quickly addressed and the woman at the front desk informed us she would issue a credit for this inconvenient. As our stay progressed, we started realizing the toilet was not really flushing. We called the front desk again and she said she would send maintenance to the room. Maintenance did not arrive for over 30 minutes! He worked on the toilet for about 20 min, left to get some more supplies, came back and applied drano and told us that the performance would improve throughout the evening. We came back after dinner and the toilet was still not flushing effectively. We were basically afraid to use the toilet during our stay. Considering we paid almost $200 a night, this was completely unacceptable. I informed the front desk woman of all the problems we encountered during our checkout and her only response was thanks for letting us know. The entire property needs a complete overhaul and renovation.Check-in was quick and easy. Parking was right behind our cottage and free. The room was spacious and the bed comfortable and clean. The grounds are gorgeous, very well kept and the view is spectacular. I wish we could have sat overlooking the city all night but for some reason they close it up at 10. There's a smaller seating area but its not exactly the same and you're closer to the rooms. Unfortunately our sleep wasn't very restful;  our air conditioner was so incredibly loud. It wasnt a constant loud, more a rattling that would wake me every 20-30 mins. Finally I turned it off and hoped it wouldn't get too warm but then the dripping started...a steady drip that kept hitting the saturated floor...it just drove me crazy.Lastly, I'm not sure if the previous occupants smoked some skunky weed in our room all night or if a skunk died under it but it permeated the room.It's a lovely motel, great value, with gorgeous views but I'll probably look elsewhere when returning.Nice location, good view, friendly and informative staffs.  Great size room (King Bed) with fireplace and great views.  Hotel was pet friendly $10 per dog per night.  Looks like they are re-modeling pool and spa.  Look forward to staying in the summer!   Rate was around $160 with dog in Jan.Our ""garden view"" room had no view, but if we walked down further there are amazing views. When asked for another room with view they wanted to up charge me $30 for just a second floor room. We reserved 5 months in advance and they couldn't get us a better room. The room is very outdated. The bathroom is nasty. There was a dirty bath tub with some type of patchwork done on it. Why don't they just replace the old tub? The carpet is old. On the first floor, you can hear the person upstairs walking around. The walls are thin.It is a good hike/walk to the airport vortex. Honestly, if you go anywhere in Sedona you have views, but again our room did not. We booked through Expedia, and there were no mountain or canyon view options.  I should've just called directly and asked for a view room. Disappointed.We came from San Diego as we try to come to Sadona, Az. at least once a year. Our first time staying at Sky Ranch Lodge-this has been the Most Magnificent place ever. From the grounds to the Magnificent Views of God's country. Every Employee was So Friendly it just made for a Glorious Stay... Thank You!Check in was quick and easy, only positive  comments in this review!Jacuzzi closed and by past reviews this remodel has been going on for months! Walls are PAPER thin. If you want any privacy don't plan on getting it here! I could hear EVERY word our neighbors said and children running down the balcony sounded like they would come thru the walls. VIEWS? NOT! Paid for a ""view room"" funny, all I see is debris from the supposed remodel. I wouldn't waste your time or money driving up to this hotel. Stay in town!We stayed for one day out in Sedona .Check in was @4(which was kind of late). We booked a room with a fireplace. It was so cozy with the fireplace inside. It was a nice room. Had a microwave, table for one to have breakfast,lunch or dinner. The bed was comfortable and there was hot water unlike some of the other reviews had said. They also have washing machines to wash which is great if you're hiking. Overall it was a nice room wish we could've stayed longer. Has a nice view as well and close to the little shops in Sedona .First off, lets start off with saying the views are GORGEOUS! However the rooms are extremely dated, HORRIBLE customer service (witnessed by bridal party and guests while the hotel staff argues behind the desk) AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE FOR A WEDDING! Now to the more serious reason as to why I am actually going to review this location.. We found this venue on The Knot and decided to use it for our wedding venue in January! Started initially talking to Amanda, who would take a bit to reply to any emails or voicemail but she got the job done. Amanda moved towards the middle of us talking and getting things in order and we were transferred to another wedding coordinator for the venue Meagan. (We live in the valley and had to drive to Sedona and had an appointment to meet Meagan) When we arrived, we were told that Meagan was no longer in that position and that they were in between people. No phone call. I then had to call Amanda who apologized and said she was going to stay until they could find someone to actually replace her. So we went about our way until they found Kris. Never received a phone call from Kris, just an email and it was only in response to my email to them. Should have cancelled the venue at this point but we were so in awe with the views that we decided to go further with this venue. After being through 3 different people and getting different answers each time we got everything paid and now it was a waiting game, When we finally arrived to the venue and got settled in is when the real issues started. First off, Amanda guaranteed that if we booked rooms as a wedding party we would get the better rooms. Yet people booked ONLINE, got BETTER quotes, and when it was brought up to KRIS, She said  SHE WOULD ADJUST THE RIM ROOMS to match the better price because they cant keep up with all the online prices. THE ONLY ROOM TO GET ADJUSTED WAS THE MOTHER IN LAWS. THE BRIDES ROOM WAS NOT AND NEITHER WAS THE BRIDAL PARTIES! So onward to 5:30 PM when rehearsal started. No mic no music, just a run through. Someone complained and they sent a member of the lodge out to say we were being too loud. It is a wedding rehearsal at 5:30pm, how loud could we be. So we ended the rehearsal and went back to the rooms. The real issue is the wedding day. Kris, the coordinator never showed up to the wedding like she said she would, never came out when issues arrised and never kept up with anything. The ceremony was beautiful and on the the recpetion. Again at 5:30pm Tom came into the tent to say the music is too loud and guests are complaining. The bar manager PROVIDED BY SKY RANCH says they never complain this early. So you now have an upset bride and bridal party so we went to the office where TJ apparently the gm was called back to the site. Went back and forth about how ALL THEIR PAPERWORK SAYS VOLUME TO BE LOWERED AT 9:30 etc and he wasnt willing to do anything. So he eventually came out of the office after arguing with the 4 people in the office concerned for their reception and the money spent, and OK'D THE VOLUME FOR OUR DJ TO PLAY THE MUSIC and the party went on. NO MORE THAT 10 MINUTES LATER, THE COPS CAME BECAUSE THE MUSIC WAS TOO LOUD! MIND YOU THIS IS AROUND 6:30PM!!!!!!! So TJ once again shows up with the cops that he called because his ego was hurt that he got called out. So the cops sent one cop to the bottom of the hill and the other stayed on top, they again OK'd the volume and left. At this point everyone was so upset that the bride had to deal with a HORRIBLE venue with HORRIBLE SERVICE AND THE POLICE on one day that was supposed to be special that we ended everything by 7:30pm. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE FOR A WEDDING! I WOULDNT EVEN RECOMMEND STAYING HERE UNTIL THEY REMODEL AND NOT THE POOL OR HOTTUB LIKE THEY DECIDED.. THE ONLY POSITIVE IS THE VIEWS.  YOU PAY WAY TOOOOO MUCH TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH OUTDATED ROOMS, RUDE STAFF, INCOMPETENT OWNERS AND A RUINED WEDDING DAY! SERIOUSLY RE CONSIDER THIS VENUE FOR A WEDDING!!!!!! I should have gone with my gut and gone elsewhere. THERE ARE TONS OF VENUES IN SEDONA ALL WITH VIEWS AND BETTER SERVICE. SERIOUSLY GO THEIR. ITS ONE DAY THATS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST DAY AND SKY RANCH WILL LET YOU DOWN!The website does not tell you that not all rooms have a view and they are not very private but they are lovely none-the-Less. Tried to get a room changed and were told no other rooms available although not everyone has checked in and/or unless we pay for it even though the info that led me to book the room was misleading, this was not the hotels fault but Pricelines. Overall a nice spot and pretty grounds. Nice well maintained pool and spa.NOT CLEAN!!!I Made reservations here for out 10th anniversary. We checked in an hour early and they said the room was ready. We got the keys, went to the room and began to look around. The room looked ok, the exterior was a little dated. But when we looked in the bathroom, there were a pair of dirty underwear hanging in the shower. Absolutely disgusting!!! We immediately grabbed our bags and left for the front office. I discretely told the manager about the offending matter. She said, ""oh sorry."" I stated we were not going to stay here. She offered to find us another room elsewhere but it was late in the afternoon and no rooms were available. My wife and I drove back home to Phoenix. Thank you Sky Ranch for ruining my anniversary.Pay a little more for the rim view- priceless! Beautiful grounds with gardens and koi ponds, friendly and helpful staff, incredible view and the lovely Sedona energy all added up to a fantastic experience. I will definitely be back to Sky Ranch Lodge.I had my wedding at Sky Ranch Lodge in November and we stayed there for a few days after we got married.  The venue was stunning - I am so happy I picked SRL as my venue site.   Even though there was a staffing/wedding coordinator change in the middle of my planning everything was perfect the day of and they were all very accommodating.  Jerry is especially awesome.  Did I mention how awesome that view is!  Amazing! The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the rooms/patios are a bit older and outdated - but what else can you expect when you are staying at a ""lodge"". Overall my experience was wonderful and  I would not have changed a thing.This post is only for hotel and not the staff. The room had no view and is very outdated. The air conditioning unit was not even turned on when I arrived to my room and the temperature is in the 90's. It took awhile for the room to cool down and it still felt muggy. It has a dirty feel to it. You can stay at other hotels in Sedona for a better price and with a better view.Stayed here for 3 nights on our recent trip to Sedona.  This place is a lodge so although it lacks some of the amenities of the bigger hotels in the area, it has the best views of Red Rocks.  The views from this lodge is truly impeccable that many visitors drive to this lodge for the views.  We stayed in a  double queen, garden room.  The room was of good size.  It had a microwave, coffee maker, and a small fridge.  The grounds were beautiful, and had many nooks and crannies with great views.  The hotel had a decent sized pool and hot tub.  We also loved that this lodge was feline friendly with a pet fee of $10 a night.  If you want amazing views of Sedona, this is definitely the place to be at an affordable price.  Will definitely stay here again.","Altho an older motel, it's a very nice comfortable place to stay.  They offer nice amenities in the form of a sunset overlook and a wine bar.  Both are so nice to relax at and sit and talk with fellow travelers. The pool was very nice...heated...and nicely landscaped. The airport Mesa Grill restaurant is within walking distance and there are a couple of pull offs on the road that you can stop and enjoy the landscape, one with a very large parking area and panoramic view, (also within walking distance) and a much smaller area on the way up/down that is a vortex site.  Love this location for the amazing views and being able to walk around the immediate area.Stayed here for 2 nights with friends. Awesome views, nice gardens, super close to the Airport Rd Vortex. Rooms are older but clean. Cute decor in the rooms. Room has a front door by the parking lot and a back door to a semi-private back patio and gardens.  Pool is older but cute with shade trees and towels provided.A few things to be aware of:1. Hotel staff does NOT tell you that front door to the room locks automatically. Back door does not have an exterior lock at all so only the front door can be unlocked from the outside.2. Hotel staff does NOT tell you that if you lock the deadbolt to the front door and leave out the back door with your key...you will be locked out. The key they give you does NOT work on the deadbolt. They just don't give you a key to the deadbolt or even give you a heads up about the key / door situation.3. Cleaning crew turns the AC on the lowest possible temperature while cleaning and then leaves it, so the AC unit freezes up. Then when you arrive and turn it to a regular temperature it unfreezes and drips water all over the floor.4. Maintenance man, Tom, was our savior. He quickly addressed each issue as we ran into them. He was curteous and knowledgable. True handy man. And he apologized profusely for each incident we had, stating that he had made suggestions to management on how to avoid each situation and make the guests more comfortable....they just have yet to take his advice. I guess that's just job security for Tom!Overall I had a good stay, enjoyed the relaxing surroundings and would totally stay here again. I just wish I had read a review with this info in it before arriving for my visit!This place was just Ok for the money we paid to stay here. The ladies at the front desk weren't rude but they weren't friendly either. The place is very beautiful and very well kept. The pool closes at 9 though which i personally thing is way too early considering EVERYONE here is on VACATION! why not keep it open til 11?? Our room was nice enough and the beds were moderately comfortable, however my mom would disagree. My main complaint about the room was that we could hear every single step and movement the people above us made! Any time they walked, got into bed or went to the bathroom it sounded like they were gonna come crashing through the ceiling. VERY VERY ANNOYING! It made it extremely difficult to sleep since our upstairs neighbors didn't sleep at all it seemed. It sounded like 3 people constantly running the length of the room for hours and hours on end. The hotel is in a great location for any fun Sedona activities you are looking for. If you don't mind not getting any sleep stay on the first floor! I, on the other hand will not be staying here again.The only redeeming qualities of Sky Ranch Lodge is Jerry, his staff, and the beautiful view. Since we first booked our wedding, the wedding coordinator position changed through three different people. Each new coordinator said items in our contract were no longer permitted under new ownership. We had the overlook reserved the Friday before our wedding for the rehearsal, they overbooked and we were told we were no longer able to use it. We reserved the room right next to the overlook the Friday before and that Saturday for the wedding. When we went on Friday they told us they overbooked that room and we would not be able to get in. When we went on Saturday, we were not able to check in until noon. The wedding coordinator said she is at the venue the whole day of a wedding - she was no where to be found the entire day! The manager would not respond to any calls or emails.That being said the view is absolutely amazing and Jerry (the man who should run this place) was the most amazing guy ever! He was there for 9 am to 11 pm and made sure that our magical day was as perfect as it could be! We had an amazing time the day of our wedding but we did do everything ourselves!So far so good! The rooms are modest but clean. The staff all seems very nice and helpful. When we come back, we'll ask for a cottage. The views are great! If someone is looking for a wedding venue....look no further! It's perfect for that. If possible, bring your own pillows. These aren't the most comfortable.Ended up finding this gem on Tripadvisor! It sits at the top of a mountain nearby all the sightseeing. The views really are the best in Sedona. Customers of SRL get their own private lookout! They have their own bar, lots of garden trails and outdoor seating for guests as well. We stayed in the deluxe king room complete with a mini fridge, microwave, cooking utensils, and dishware. The bathroom is spacious and there is plenty of shelving for all of your things. The bed was gigantic! We were supposed to have a view from our balcony but it ended up being mostly of trees in the garden below. However, the view from our front door was spectacular! Very quiet and friendly place. If you stay and get to experience the private lookout, there's a second trail just out to the left if the patio gets too crowded.Stayed overnight Easter weekend for a quick romantic getaway. When we first pulled up I was a little concerned. But once we checked in and got to our room, I relaxed and all worries went out the door. The grounds are older, but kept up and really pretty. The views around the property are incredible. Unfortunately our room did not have a view, which was disappointing but the room itself was pretty nice. We had our dog with us, and they are a pet-friendly hotel, so we were pretty pleased. Right outside the lobby is a wine bar and a good sized seating area. It's only open in late afternoon/early evening. We got a nice glass of malbec and went to the viewing area to watch the sunset. So did everyone else, it was pretty fun socializing with people who were from all over. Everyone was enjoying themselves, taking pictures of the views, drinking some wine, having fun. The bed in the room was comfortable and so were the pillows. The room had a nice flat screen TV with basic cable, also had a few other amenities, most importantly, a coffee machine and a bar sized fridge. I would probably stay here again, it was a good value for the money we spent and in a very good area not far from the airport and some hiking trails and a vortex.We knew the rooms were older when we booked the room, we didn't need all the frills for one evening. I thought the room was cozy and even had a fireplace. One of the lamps and one outlet didn't work. We had a garden view room on the second floor and the views from our back patio were incredible. The balconies are only semi-private because the dividing wall doesn't go all the way to the railing. We liked that the hotel was on a hill and had breathtaking views of the red rocks. The grounds are immaculate and the hotel is dog friendly which is awesome. The hotel had quite a few guests but we never really saw anyone else and everyone was so quiet.The hotel pool is pretty standard hotel 6 type design and wasnt anything to write home about. No room service or breakfast, but that's not a huge problem. We had a pleasant stay and thought the staff was very friendly.I was recommended this place a couple years ago and on this trip around decided to check it out. The place has a great location and really cool access to a beautiful sunset, that's about it. Pretty mellow surroundings and beautiful grounds, but the staff was very rude (like horribly rude to a ridiculous level). The rooms a poorly updated and overpriced. Sedona is beautiful and this place could be a lot better, it's a shame it's not. Oh, the closely located Mesa grille which is pretty good and worth checking out.LOVED staying here!!!! The hotel sits up on the Mesa next to the airport overlooking Sedona and the red rocks. The view from our room was AMAZING!! The beds were so comfortable, I slept very well all three nights. The grounds were clean and quaint. The staff friendly and helpful. Our stay was VERY quiet and peaceful. We would most definitely come again.Most of the rooms here don't have a view - something that you don't realize until you get there. However you're right near one of the vortexes and walking distance to the best view in Sedona.We came to Sedona wanting to stay a few days but just booked one night to try out Sky Ranch. I'm glad we did because our ""pet"" room STUNK like dog pee. Considering you have to pay extra for a dog, I'd expect a clean room. My dog doesn't shed and certainly doesn't pee inside, so it seems unfair. By the morning with the heat on, the smell was overwhelming and we decided to leave and stayed elsewhere.Also, the picture of the rooms shows a fireplace but there was no fireplace, just a very basic motel-like room.Second stay. Super friendly staff. Clean, renovated rooms. Incredible views! Convenient location, but off the highway. We would absolutely stay again.Wow- this place is a gem! We were driving through with our 2 dogs and not only was it a dog friendly hotel, it was gorgeous! The room was clean, comfortable and spacious. But the views! We arrived at night so didn't see much, but did some great star gazing. We woke up the next day and just walking around the place was amazing. And the staff was super helpful with tips about where to go, what to see etc. We had a fantastic time!This place was PERFECT for us! Me and my friend were here on our annual girls trip and the room was nothing fancy but it was clean and large and had a mini fridge and microwave and plenty of closet space and drawers. The views are amazing from the outlook and we enjoyed watching the sunset. The grounds and gardens are very well kept and pretty. Next time we plan to get a rim view and I KNOW I will be back here one day! If you are looking for fancy,4-star service, etc this is not your place but if you are looking for a low-key peaceful place with amazing views, stay here.We had one incident with very rude neighbors (just one night). They were yelling and talking extremely loud after midnight and didn't quit so we had to call the after hours number. About 10 minutes after our call the after hours employee came (we heard the knock on their door) and after that it was perfectly quiet. We appreciated the swift attention to the issue by the staff. The Mesa Grill is closeby, at the airport and has a good breakfast. If you want a really good inexpensive meal in Sedona, try Cafe Jose as well! If possible request a one story room (I think all the rim view rooms are 1 story) or top floor, you can hear every footstep above if you are on the bottom floor of a 2 story. The walls overall are pretty thin but it was not anything that ruined our trip. Can't wait to visit Sky Ranch again!We had a fireplace room right next to the wine bar &amp; pool. It was great! You can tell that the rooms are older, but they are very clean and well-kept! Our king bed was very comfortable with oversized pillows. There was a mini-fridge and microwave in our room, which was perfect for leftovers and for the case of water we picked up from the grocery store (a must!). TV is an old box tv, but we were so busy we only turned it on once. Fireplace is gas and super easy to operate...we really enjoyed having it! The winebar is small and outdoors, but it is enclosed with heaters and there is a tv that had some games on. The sunset view is awesome, but there is limited seating so if you want to sit, get there about 45 min before the sun goes down. There wasn't any drink service at the sunset location, but the winebar is nearby and you can bring drinks over. Just note that you can only drink your own alcohol in the rooms and if you want to drink on property, you have to purchase it from them. We didn't check out the pool or hot tub, but they look average. If it were warmer we would have definitely spent an evening in the hot tub. The rest of the property is really cute, with winding paths through the gardens and views of the red rocks. Mesa Grille is walking distance from the hotel and they have great food! It is small and last seating was at 8:30pm on a Thursday, but it was worth it. Overall, a great experience (and great value) and we will definitely return!We always try different hotels while in Sedona. That may have come to an end with this lodge. First off don't expect a nice new modern hotel. No asphalt in sight, only crushed rock driveways and parking areas. It's an older motel style with real door keys (remember those?).  Now that I dropped your expectations of this place let me tell you why you should stay here. First off it's located minutes from town and it's the only place to stay on top of the plateau next to the airport which has a very nice restaurant, bar that will even provide room service for you. The staff is most friendly, both on the phone who helped us with a train tour package and in person. By the way the train package this is a fabulous deal and good up to four people on the train. It's a must. But if you're staying multiple nights don't try to arrange it yourself on the website, call  the lodge.  The rooms are very clean and from what we can see all come with microwave, refrigerator, coffee pot, and free Wi-Fi. The grounds are maintained well and include lots of walking areas,  streams, and lots of places to sit, and a very special lodge only viewing area to watch sunsets on the red rock mountains with the view of the city below. In fact the road up to the lodge becomes very crowded at sunset because everyone wants to get to a small public viewing area next to the lodge.  If you're looking for a place to truly just relax this is it. And with prices in Sedona being all over the place this is a very reasonable place to stay.   We now know where were staying the next time we visit  Sedona.Great views of the valleyQuaint lodge that was nice but very old school.  Clean rooms that were from times gone by, outside doors in units built together in sets of four.  Only one floor, small, but had table, bed, TV, sink, bath etc.  Grounds were flowered, guests were friendly and the setting extremely quiet.  Near the airport and on our first night a wedding took place.  We all slept through any noise!For Sedona, I felt like this place was a really nice hotel to stay at.  Especially if you are big on the Vortex.  The hotel is just up the street from the Airport Mesa Vortex.  We walked there.  A little scary because cars race up and down this 2 lane road.The hotel allows for people to bring their dogs.  Pretty cool.  There is a wine bar just right of the main check-in door.  At sunset you can grab a glass of wine and mosey on out to the lookout area.  Which I might add is super beautiful.  Just 100ft up the street they ask for donations to use their lookout area.  I felt super lucky to have such a nice area to watch Sedona's beautiful sunset.Hotel rooms are very simple and to the point.  There is some kind of smell, I think from the air conditioner?  But it reminds me of Asian boba.  LOL.  I happen to like that smell, so works out for me.  Didn't get to swim in the pool, but I touched the water and it was a good temperature.  Bonus I found out if you are a repeat customer, you mention it and get a discount off your next stay.Five stars for overall value. Best prices in Sedona with amazing views. It was nice to have our own little kitchenette to keep drinks and snacks cool. The room was very clean and basic. Who needs to spend time in a hotel room when you could be out hiking in Sedona?!?! Front desk was very helpful with questions. The grounds are beautiful and the pool looked refreshing even though I never had time to dive in. Only frustration is that the #1 rated spot to see the rocks at sunset is located a few hundred yards from the property and if you are trying to leave or return you have to dodge cars and pedestrians. Minor inconvenience for the amazingly low price I paid.Beautiful location with amazing views.  The rooms are cute, but it's really all about the views.  The hotel is located at the top of a mountain near a little airport.  Looking down on the town is just perfect.  I took more pictures than necessary.","The views are absolutely amazing! We took our beer and wine outside with us to watch the sunset. Gorgeous! The room prices are very reasonable for the service, views and accommodations.Second time stayed here over the past three years. Love this place. Away from the noise and crowds. Best place to view sunset is from the back of our Room. Large sitting areas behind your room plus an overlook  The wine bar is a great place to relax, have a glass and enjoy the view. The folks at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. I have no problem recommending this spot. It's not the four seasons but the views, hospitality, location and the price name it great.I want to compliment the front desk staff!  After checking in and getting settled in our room, a large party moved into the room next door. When I went up to the front desk they were so accommodating and more than happy to move us to another room. This is a beautiful spot and all the staff are so friendly!Great location and view.  Rooms comfortable.  Property was well-kept and charming.  Bathrooms a little sparse but clean.  Best part was friendly staff and the most delicious apples at check-in.  Great location near the vortex!We drove up on a Friday afternoon for a sunset wedding. If you are a couple looking for a venue look no further. This place will make your wedding photos, which last a lifetime right? As we pulled into the lot the property staff was very helpful, directing us to the correct parking area, which there was plenty. There was staff everywhere for questions and directions. The public restrooms were large and clean.I comfortably stayed in a room near the garden and fish pond. The shade and fresh breeze was refreshing after being in the desert and canyon sightseeing! Another reviewer noted the room as ""outdated"" but I call it vintage - reminds me of the clean but simple motor lodges of my childhood.Located next to Sedona Airport, Sky Ranch Lodge was a perfect place for me to stay when I went on my spontaneous solo trip to Sedona.  Since the trip was unplanned, I called the lodge as I was driving out of LA to get to Sedona which was around 9pm.  I booked the room, got to Sedona around 6am and had no problem checking in.  I WAS lucky because they actually had a room open that early in the morning, but everything went so smooth, I was able to completely enjoy my stay in Sedona.It's no Hilton or Ritz Carlton but a very comfortable and beautiful lodge.  They have a pool, jacuzzi and the most wonderful view of the whole valley.  I went into Sedona in pitch black so when the sun started to rise, it was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.WOW, wow, wow, is what we said when we first walked into our room.The fireplace &amp; view of the beautiful rock formations from the back porch is the reason for five stars.  It's not a fancy or new place, but it's really comforting, peaceful, &amp; the room definitely has character.  There's also a mini kitchen &amp; a ""heater"" option in the bathroom.  Regarding the heater, it may not sound like much, but believe me, when it's like 30 something degrees outside, it's a feature you really appreciate!We got here right before sunset, &amp; immediately sat outside to just stare at the awesome view we had.  Not only is it picturesque, but right away you notice how quiet it is too.Drove five hours to get here from Vegas, &amp; as exciting &amp; fun as Vegas is, I had a hard time leaving this place.  I found myself excited to get up early in the morning, just so I could watch the sunrise.If we ever are blessed to come &amp; visit Sedona again, we won't have to look for another place to stay.  This is THE ONE!We stayed at Sky Ranch on a recommendation from a friend.  We stayed for two nights.  Our room had a partial view with balcony at the end of the road.  Wow, it was so fabulous.  First the hotel is secluded up Airport Road.  No lights, traffic or noise.  We slept with the windows open.  The views are stunning!  The hotel is older, but our room was very clean and spacious, everything worked just fine in the room.  We had a small fireplace and table.  What really sold it for me was the location of the hotel and how quiet it was in the evenings.  You felt like you were truly out in nature instead of the busy main parts of town.  Staff was very friendly and the grounds were very well kept.We stayed here on our way to the Grand Canyon.  It was a great choice.  After the Four Seasons, we needed something a little less luxurious to bring us down to earth.This is a clean, pretty, well-laid out motel with extraordinary views. I found it absolutely endearing that they use the old keys(no cards yet!) for their rooms. It brought me back to my childhood road trips with my father, where we always stayed in motels with keys! The knoll area gives a stunning view of the surrounding red rocks, with a wonderful sunset, while there are nice garden grounds with lots of chairs and benches to relax. There is an interesting restaurant next door with a view also of red rocks and airplanes. Although we only stayed one day, fellow travelers were diverse, friendly, and down to earth. Prices remind me of the 1980's.Best view in Sedona. Be sure to grab a bottle of wine, and watch the sunset. The service is excellent! When my fiance and I arrived for my birthday weekend, they even upgraded us to a room with a view of all of Sedona and the red rock. You can even order from the restaurant down the street, as room service. my fiance got the ceviche and I got a large salad with salmon. Delicious. I must say, I am incredibly impressed by the seafood in Arizona. I was not expecting it to be so fresh!The rooms are clean and rustic. The whole lodge is quiet, and perfect for a relaxing weekend away. Plus, there's a vortex you can walk to, right down the road. The whole place feels like the Big Sur of the desert. We will definitely be coming back to Sedona, probably in the winter, to enjoy the cooler hiking temperatures, a relaxing stay in the jacuzzi post-hike, and and the romantic in-room fireplace at night.Great value, they upgraded us our room free since they accidentally overbooked. Thank you for a great two days. The service was great.We stayed here for 2 nights, staff from friendly, room was clean and the view at sunset was possibly the best in Sedona.  The room decor was nothing fancy but hey we were not here to stay indoors so for the price I would stay here again.  As for the location it was close to downtown, but not downtown so it was quiet and had minimal traffic.We had a very nice stay here. It is off the main streets so it is quiet and peaceful. It also boasts one of the best views in town. Being right next to the airport we were concerned about noise but apparently the airport has little traffic, especially at night. The only airplane we heard was in the morning, around 8AM. The only negative is that the property is old and can use a bit of work - nothing major though. Just things like a loose doorknob. It is very clean and the staff is very nice and pleasant. Will stay there again. There is not a restaurant on the property so you will have to drive to eat. Note: do not eat at the restaurant at the airport (Mesa Grill).For the view and price, you can't beat it. The rooms reminded me of of really nice camping cabins because the decor was outdated, but clean. They room was sufficient for my needs and the shower water pressure was strong, which I love. The staff was nice. The landscaping was pleasant, including the flowing water feature and fish, but thought the fake concrete boulders were a bit tacky.After driving from New Mexico for hours, with no idea where to stay, I did a quick search for hotels in Sedona. The Sky Ranch popped up, sounded nice, so I visited the website. The site listed an available room for $90, but I had an error when booking.  I decided to call otherwise, I wouldn't have anywhere to stay that night. Alex answered the phone with a friendly tone and warm greeting. I explained where I was driving from and that I had an error when booking the $90 rate. He explained that there were no rooms available &amp; that he could give me a $135 rate room instead. I thanked him, but declined as it was just too expensive for me. He said he understood and asked how long it would be until I arrived. After estimating an arrival time, Alex asked me to hold on for a moment so he could see what he was able to offer me. About 3 mins passed before he came back to the line with an amazing rate. It was in my price range and I could absolutely afford it. I thanked him, said yes as quickly as possible and continued on the drive to the lodge.   I arrived with my sister after she navigated us through the winding canyon roads of Sedona and we were greeted by an exuberant, smiling Alex. Not only did he serve as a bright spot in our tiring journey, but he had an even lower rate when I checked in to our room. He was our Knight in shining armor and saved our skins that night.This place wouldn't be much without the outstanding view. I was surprised that it was on the expensive side considering the rooms are old and there isn't much offered onsite other than a small beer/wine bar and snack shop. Although the Mesa Grill at the Sedona Airport is within walking distance, it would have been nice if there was room service during the morning/daytime, especially for people who are staying there for a wedding, like I was. On the Saturday morning of the wedding, my boyfriend and I wanted to order something to eat around 10am so I could shower, get ready, and head over to the bride's room where I knew I would be for several hours before the wedding started. I then realized that room service is only offered at dinnertime. I certainly didn't have time to walk to the nearby restaurant and wait for takeout. Similarly, my boyfriend wasn't ready to go anywhere since he had just woken up and I wouldn't let him use the bathroom while I was getting ready. If it weren't for my best friend, the bride, sharing her bagel with me, I would have starved until the reception, like my boyfriend did. He decided not to go there even after I left the room because he didn't want to have to spend $10-$15 dollars just to eat breakfast/lunch. Other than that, I like the setup of the hotel and the wine/beer bar is REALLY inexpensive. You're allowed to walk anywhere on the property with your drink as long as you purchased it through the hotel. If you bring your own alcohol, you can only drink it in your room. I forgot that small detail and brought a 1-shot flask to the reception since I was nervous about giving a speech. One of the employees saw it and was completely rude about it even though I apologized and put the flask away. She then had another employee use the microphone to announce that outside liquor was not permitted. Calm down lady, it was a 1.5 ounce key chain flask! Someone also said that they heard this same employee talking badly about our group for bringing the alcohol and threatening to shut down the whole wedding, which she did not have the authority to do anyway. She was extremely unprofessional but, the wedding was absolutely beautiful with the breathtaking view of all the red rocks in the background.  We had such an amazing time and despite some of the issues we encountered, I would still say this is an excellent wedding venue. Additionally, the pool is quite small, but not a deal breaker. I really wanted to give this hotel 2 stars due to the rude employee, the outdated rooms, and lack of food services onsite, but I'm giving it 3 because it probably has the best view out of any hotel in Sedona.Stayed at The Sky Ranch Lodge this past April. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very friendly. The views were incredible. There is an awesome sitting area overlooking Sedona's Red Rocks that we enjoyed with coffee in the am, and a cocktail the night before. Nice jacuzzi and pool, and just very quiet and perfect for what we were looking for. It's far enough off the beaten path to still be secluded, but close enough to downtown so you can grab dinner and shop without having to drive too far. There's a beautiful hike a quarter mile down the road that took us about an hour and a half to complete. ""Airport Loop.""  We got lunch at the Mesa grille as recommended by the Sky Ranch staff, and was very pleased with the food there. Overall, this place was priced appropriately, peaceful, and I would absolutely stay again when I return to Sedona.The Big Bear Airport Pilots Association booked several rooms, from the cheapest ($90) to the most expensive ($160) and all were excellent. All 13 of us enjoyed the experience. The property is VERY well maintained and a pleasure to walk through. The Mesa Grill is a nice place to dine and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. We stayed in a view room, which with a deck facing the city and bluffs to the south, was worth the few extra dollars; however, the other rooms on the property face incredibly tranquil landscaping with brooks, ponds, patios and outside wine bar. Free coffee in the lobby and the rooms.This trip made for lifetime memories. I would NOT hesitate recommending Sky Ranch Lodge to anyone. We will be back in the future.an awesome place. Honestly, we picked it for our 2 night Sedona stay because of the price. it was way cheaper than other places in town. But holy cow, this place was fantastic. the views, and even the drive to the hotel were beautiful. there is lush greenery with a stream running through the property. the wine bar was great, and served beer to the joy of my husband. we didn't use the pool/hot tub but it looked great. the rooms were large, and the amenities lovely. it was such a pleasant stay- relaxing with the most amazing sunsets in town. even the locals showed up for the views/wine.","This past weekend was one of my sisters 21st birthday.. in order to celebrate in style, we had planned on a road trip to Vegas, but being the Sedona freak that I am, I suggested we spend one night there before heading off to the city of sin. Of course, as usual, I got lost trying to find the place. I am the most terrible person in the universe when it comes to directions, so it took a few bitch flips before I found it. Its up on Airport Rd. and has the most incredible views of any other hotel I've ever seen there. Its not like a hotel at all either, its little cabins scattered around a beautiful property with pathways, streams and like I said, places to park your ass to take in the beautiful red rocks. I will say the actual rooms are extremely dated, so if these guys invested a little cash to give it a more modern update, I would have given it that 5th star. After dinner and half a bottle of rum, we decided the hot tub would be a good idea. I am kind of paranoid about public swimming pools, especially spas cause you know what kind of ish that goes down in them, but their facility was extremely clean and well maintenanced. My germaphobe fears went away, but I think that probably had something to do with rum :o)Staff, amazing. Totally accommodating, and wicked friendly. The woman at the front desk immediately gave off a relaxed comfortable vibe about the place. Even though the Sedona airport is a few steps away, the noise wasn't too bad. I think I heard a total of 2 planes cruise by. No big deal.I would totally stay here again. Aside from the retro flower tiles and TV's from the 80's, its situated in a fabulous location and the prices are extremely reasonable.What a great place to stay! The decor isn't modern... far from it. ""Rustic"" is closer to correct, I think. Standing on the deck in the evening with a glass of wine, watching the sun set over Sedona... Wow. Horribly, terribly, awesomely relaxing.Friendly, helpful staff. Neat, funky grounds. Off the main drag.Can get a little noisy during the day because of the helicopter tours. Otherwise, a great place to stay!Love this place!! Its beautiful, quiet, incredible views. Relaxing &amp; romantic too. We didn't want to leave...its a slice of heaven there!! Won't stay anywhere else now.It's hard to rate this Lodge - as the views can be 5-star and the rooms are ""OK"" - We stayed in one of the multi-level units for a couple nights and then moved to a rim-room with a mini-kitchenette (more expensive than the multi-level unit) for a couple nights.  The rim room was actually supposed to have a better view than our previous room - and it didn't.  Somehow our rim room was situated in such a way that the view was blocked unless we were outside and moved along the pathway.  The view was spectacular - All of the staff was very pleasant and helpful.  The rooms are dated (carpet, bed spreads, lighting, etc.) - and appeared to be clean.  While close to the airport, we were not bothered by air plane noise in either of our rooms.We would stay here again for the views.Beautiful grounds and spectacular views. The room was a little dated but clean and cozy. The only thing I would advise is to request a room on the upper floor as the college kids that stayed above us were like a stampeding herd of elephants until the wee hours of the morning. Not easy to sleep with the racket even with ear plugs in. Otherwise a nice stay.I loved everything about this place!  The location is high above everything and just steps away from the most amazing views.  The grounds are well-manicured and inviting.  The rooms are clean and spacious though the decor is outdated.  No matter, it actually added to the ""experience.""  Very ""ranch-y"" feel, which let me know I was in AZ.  Free WiFi.  Great price.  Excellent service.Loved the place, try to get rooms facing the mountains. Rooms are simple but cozy, open fireplace is great. Staff super nice and accommodating. For breakfast check out the restaurant at the airport, great views and modern interior. Good serviceStunning views and tons of fun. It's an older place but very well kept and I prefer it over newer and fancier places. Give it a shot and ask for a room with the best views!I love this place.  The kids had a blast and the sunsets are the best from our patio.It was actually nice getting to know the neighbors and it was great to see that people could bring their dogs along, too.The best hotel on our trip so far. I'm a little fearful of posting this review as it may make this little gem of a hotel too popular so I can't get a room here on my next trip!Sky Ranch Lodge is located next to Sedona Airport, up on a hill. It's located right next to a great viewpoint that tons of people drive up to catch the view, especially at sunset. The airport mesa halfway up the airport road is also worth a short hike for the views back south.We splashed out on a room with a view. Wow!!! I doubt many other hotel rooms in the world have a view to match this. There's a small deck outside to sit and admire the view.The hotel room was spacious enough for 4 of us. Bathroom wasn't huge but fine for us. Just be aware that the bath isn't full size if you fancy a bath.There's a heated pool and jacuzzi. A computer is available in the lobby.Fantastic hotel.I don't have much to add that will be any different than other Yelpers have already said.It's a great bargain for the low price.The room on the rim with the private patio had an amazing view!There are no frills here but we didn't need anything!We stayed two nights at the end of June 2011 and we would definitely go here again!Stayed here for a relaxing night while visiting Sedona with a friend. Amazing views, spacious rooms with many amenities, clean, comfortable, fireplace, comfortable beds. Nice pool and Jacuzzi...enjoyed walking the grounds and drinking wine on the patio. I'll be back and would recommend to all!!!I was a bridesmaid in a wedding held at Sky Ranch Lodge recently. I have been in many weddings and never have I seen such an awesome staff that is so willing to help in whatever the bride and family needed. Jerry especially was incredibly helpful and patient with all of us and our wedding craziness. He was on standby to help with any little detail we needed and when we forgot something or didn't have something he was there immediately to help us with a solution. I want to personally thank Jerry for all he did, we could not have made it without you! The front desk was also very kind in helping with deliveries that we were expecting and also very helpful with room arrangements. My sister and her new husband had the most amazing day of their life and I truly am grateful to Jerry and the rest of the staff for making that happen. My husband and I will be returning soon for a wonderful stay at the Sky Ranch Lodge!HOT HOT HOT.... Sedona, Arizona has lots of HEAT and fortunately the Sky Ranch Lodge provided some relief. This quaint lodge didn't have luxury amenities, but they have a spacious room set up, air conditioning, a pool and A jacuzzi! The Room-Two queen size beds-Air conditioning-Tons of dresser and closet space-Porch with patio furniture-No refrigerator in room, but they can deliver one to your room to use during your stay!-Free wifi (didn't use it though)Lodge &amp; Surrounding-Nice grounds with patio furniture to picnic -Pool &amp; jacuzzi -Scenic points just before the lodge -Diner close by (though they weren't open on Sunday when we went)The Staff-Hospitable. They accommodated our party of 8 and provided us with items we needed like a fridge, a lighter, etc. Yes a lighter to light a birthday candle! Price-Rates were moderate during summer (August), but can easily be split between four people in your group.The grounds here are lovely.  The view from the lookout is spectacular.  The proximity to the airport vortex is good.  But the room is a dump.  It's shabby, dark, run down and just kind of depressing.  I don't want to touch the bedspread.  I had to call the front desk to request a remote control for the old tube tv with bad reception.I'm supposed to stay here tomorrow night too.  I'm hoping I can move to another hotel without having to pay for a second night here.Loved it!! We stayed there from March 31-April 4, 2013 in a King bed with a fireplace and partial view. We were able to bring our pooch with us and she loved it too. Like everyone states.... The rooms are very clean and they look cabin-y. The view from the second floor was great! Even though they are dog-friendly, they ask that the dog not be left alone in the room by itself. It's a good thing that Sedona is a very dog-friendly town!!We would definitely go back there again!! The wine bar was a great little extra. The restaurant at the airport was great! Since the hotel is above the town, the view is Amazing!! Thanks for a great time!!! :)My husband and I got the garden view room with a fireplace and loved it! The fireplace was perfect. The views were amazing! The room was not flashy or modern by any means but had a homey comfortable cottage feel. The balcony is not private its sort of shared with neighboring rooms but it was a very sweet quaint experience. I loved the wine bar and the breathtaking views. It was perfect for our valentines day adventure but I would not suggest this for someone that is planning on walking wherever they go. Its up on a hill and away from everything.The views are fantastic! Other than that, the rooms are okay. Nothing really fancy, which is okay since I was only in my room to sleep. I paid about $90 a night which is average I guess. I would ask that maybe they can include foot lights in the quad area in the back and more seats. There were only 4 chairs out there so not much room to sit to admire the stars and Sedona.Love this place.   It has the best views located high above the city.   Quaint place almost like a mom and pop place.  The grounds are beautiful and peaceful.  We enjoyed the jacuzzi after a long day of hiking.  We can't wait until we return to Sedona because we will be staying here again.This place has great views of the area especially if you run or hike the 5 mile loop around the airport.  However, the cancellation policy is 48 hours which is not standard practice in the hotel industry, their WIFI is like dial-up from the 80's and housekeeping can't read the please do not disturb placard.","Very nice. Nice place. Nice people.The hubby and I stayed here and loved it!  We were attending a wedding in Sedona, but found this hotel to be more of what we were looking for than where the wedding was held.  We are smokers and this hotel is grandfathered in so they had smoking rooms.  We drove up from Queen Creek after staying with a friend for a few days.  I was not feeling well and when we arrived our room wasn't ready and all I wanted to do was lay down.  The staff hustled and our room was ready in 10 minutes.  The only thing missing was the fridge we requested which came about 10 minutes after that.  We really appreciated how well they took care of us.The buildings are cute.  Kind of like little cottages.  The rooms are spacious and we had all that we needed.  The pool was nice and we were happy we got to use it.There is a small plane airport just past the hotel and they have a little restaurant.  We got to eat breakfast outside watching the planes take off and land.  You can drive there but it's a short walk from the hotel.  Also a short walk is an observation area that is VERY popular at sunset.  You can get some great pictures of the valley below during the day and at night..All and all we were very happy with this hotel.  It was our first trip to Sedona (and where we got engaged!) and I know it won't be our last.  We plan to return to Sky Ranch Lodge on our next trip!The sky ranch lodge is a amazing place to stay while you are in Sedona. The rooms are very nice and very clean. The pool is nice, clean, and cool. It is a bit costly but it is a excellent place to stay. There is a nice wine bar to relax at. There is also a place to look at the stars at night. This is a overall really great place to stay.We chose the Sky Ranch Lodge because it was affordable and pet friendly, so we weren't expecting a five star hotel. But, we were pleasantly surprised with the immaculate landscaping and the amazing views. The grounds are green and lush, complete with a stream and fish pond. You can enjoy.a glass of wine from the wine bar anywhere on the grounds, including the pool or hot tub. The most surprising perk was the Sunset Overlook that has jaw-dropping views of Sedona anytime of the day.Despite all the positives, there are a couple of negatives that keep the SRL from getting 5 stars. The room decor was pretty dated/did not feel clean and the front desk was slow to answer calls.Bottom line-- it's a great value for someone on a budget.I visited Sedona with my sister. We stayed at the Skyranch Lodge the whole 7 days. Things I liked:It was cleanThere is a pool and hot tubAmazing view and a nice patio to watch the sun set from (I think sunrise would be good too... I just did not get up early enough.Hot water came fastPatio outside room was really nice Good job of landscaping Free wifiFree and easy parkingThings that could be better:Mainly  the rooms need a bit of upgrading. They are comfortable and clean enough, y but could look less cheap.If I come here again... And I would definitely consider it... I would ask for a room near the view (or even the pool or office) Our room was a way at the back near the airport, so it was far from the patio, pool and office.We stayed here for a wedding and it was interesting. The grounds are beautiful and they have breathtaking views. The rooms were not very nice and are in need of some much needed renovation. The staff was nice but I got the vibe they were walking on egg shells around the management. The front desk had a mix of people. Some were nice but there was one woman who wasn't. We didn't have a car and so we requested to take the shuttle to the store. She blatantly told us we could take it down but we would have to take a cab back. It cost us 15 bucks to get back from being maybe a mile away. Don't offer a shuttle if you can't man it during your said hours.  Also they claim to have poolside beverage service with menus and a number to call, but the only problem is there is no phone at the pool. They have a great piece of property but I don't think it is ran well. I could see this place on hotel impossible.We had the deeply unfortunate experience of being on the first floor of a 6 unit building.  ALL NIGHT LONG, Clump, Clump.  There was simply NO insulation and the folks above us were heavy footed and up LATE.The setting is nice, the rooms are relatively clean, the prices are reasonable.  On check-in, we asked to not be below someone.  We had reserved this way, but ""so sorry, we had a flood of people come in without reservations, so the room you wanted is not available.""I like writing good reviews, not complaining. IF, and ONLY IF, you can confirm a room with no one above you, then this is a great place to stay.  Otherwise, stay somewhere else.  Oh, and the wi-fi is a JOKE.Stayed here for several days around Thanksgiving.  The major draw for us was pet-friendly, which it was, and the fabulous view, which was fabulous.The units are fairly dated; it's nice that they have fireplaces and small kitchens.  The bed was really hard and uncomfortable, and the comforter was slippery so it kept sliding off during the night.The kids enjoyed the pool.We got to drive by the airport mesa vortex about a dozen times, and hiked it twice; one day we did the airport loop hiking trail which was a fairly easy four miles, my favorite part of the trip.It was suggested by the young man at the information office in Oak Creek. We were skeptical because of the location to town.... However---This place was magikal! The staff was friendly, knowledgable, and dedicated! The room was spacious, clean and peaceful. I can't say enough about the tranquil grounds and the majestic views! It's a short 5 minute walk to the airport - which was a bonus for us (airplane lovers).... I'd recommend this place to any and everyone! Well worth it!!Me and three friends spent this past Saturday night at Sky Ranch Lodge and enjoyed the stay.Although the drive up the mountain on Airport Road was kind of scary (two narrow lanes, with one railing separating cars from the edge of the cliff) it was a scenic ride.  We booked the double queen ""Rim View Rooms"", and got room 236 upon check-in.  The price was $154.00 a night and with taxes, it came to around $172.  It was so nice to open the back door of our room, step outside to the balcony, breathe in the fresh air, and take in the beautiful views of Sedona's mountains and the city below.  There are many photo ops, and the sunset was so gorgeous!  This would be a great place to come and stay with your significant other; so romantic.  As another reviewer mentioned, our room was a bit dated, but for me, didn't detract from the ambiance of the place.  I loved that the shower spray was strong, but, with four girls sharing a bathroom, the hot water ran out by the time the third gal had a go at it.  The grounds were well maintained and the employees we encountered were friendly and serviced us with a smile.  The pool is kept heated to about 90F and the Jacuzzi to 110F and both are open until 9pm.  I would definitely stay here again if I ever decide on another trip to Sedona.4.5/5 stars. Could have been a 5/5 if they had the king bed/fireplace room open for the two nights we stayed here. Otherwise they accomodated to us very well. They called us the night we were checking out of the room with the fireplace to check us in immediately into our similar room without a fireplace and had everything ready and set to go for us. The lodge was absolutely beautiful. This had to be one of the best weekends I've ever had. My boyfriend surprised me with a weekend getaway trip and for any of you boys out there looking to romance your girlfriends you should bring them here. The views are phenominal, very cabin like features, great hiking, right next to the sedona airport, and approximately 5-10 minutes away from Tlaquepaque and Uptown where everything is going on. It's great for a relaxing getaway. Kudos to this place and to my boyfriend.Great quality hotel for a very reasonable price. The room was rather outdated, but it was clean and really large! It had a mini fridge, coffee maker, and a microwave. All that stuff came in handy! However, no iron and ironing board. I wasn't in dire need of one, but I imagine that they had them available at the front desk.The staff at the front desk was very nice and helpful, despite a small snafu when we checked in... I was given my keys and sent to the wrong room. I went back and the clerk was very apologetic. It was a simple mistake; he transposed the last two numbers of the room. Oooops.Additionally, the staff offered up useful maps of the city and recommended some sight-seeing stops... very glad that I took the map and the advice.Okay, I'm sure you are asking by now... ""what's the deal with the 4 stars""? Great value, decent room, decent service... what makes this worth it? It is the VIEW! The hotel sits on a bluff that overlooks the entire valley and the views blew my mind. See, we drove in at night and having never been to Sedona, we didn't really know what to expect. When we walked out of our room the next morning and headed to the overlook,  the valley just opened up in front of us all we could do is gasp. AMAZING! Yeah, this is why you stay at the Sky Ranch Lodge.It's a decent set up. The cabins are old by have been revised. I think it could be nicer for the $$$ but its sedona-everything here is over priced! The immentities are good tho. Great view from the private viewing area they set up &amp; it has a pool &amp; spa. If you like wildlife it's perfect for possibly catching a site of some. Next to the airport so it can be a bit noisy.View is awesome and people are very nice.  They even have washers and dryers located there!  It's not the Hyatt, but it's very good accommodations.  Not someplace where you're going to be spending all your time at the hotel...but that's not a big deal because you should be out enjoying the beautiful scenery and wonderful hikes that Sedona has to offer :)It's the only hotel with such a view!   Located on top of Airport Mesa in the heart of Sedona, it's located next to the prime spot for watching a romantic sunset over the red rock!   Everyone was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful!  They have a list of restaurants they recommend in Sedona with super helpful tips.   The rooms are small but cozy with nice porches out to the Garden area.  We didn't get one of the rooms with a view, but I can only imagine how spectacular they are!I'm afraid to write a review for this place and hope that it doesn't get too popular so I can still get a room for the next time we visit Sedona. This place was terrible ( If you enjoy paying too much for a hotel stay). The customer service was just unbearable ( if you prefer cookie cutter customer service over friendly mom and pop service). They were so inconsiderate that they actually taped room keys on the front door for guests who were checking in after office hours. The rooms were dirty( if you consider an operating room the only acceptable level of cleanliness.) The sunrise view at the top of airport road viewing point  which is walking distance from the drive was was obstructed by some huge red rocks in the distance that seems to be lit on fire by the morning sunlight. ;-)  Considering that this place was about 1/4 the cost of the local best western and had more personality than the little hippie trying to sell us crystals at the vortex, we'll defiantly be back next tim were in Sedona- hoping that they're not booked up!Nice find away from town but close enough.  What a view!  Nice staff, grounds are impeccably maintained.  Even though it's dated, it's very clean and quaint.  Very reasonable and if you wanted to walk to the Mesa Grill at the airport, it was only a few hundred yards away.  Would stay again.  Quaint and peacefulWe have been staying here for the past 20 years and will not stay anywhere else. It is a small quaint peaceful place.This place is amazing. We got a great price on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FPriceline.com&amp;s=a7fbdccf674e97746685dfb19eddf988696e5a62d38c815fc567f952b1c07748"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Priceline.com</a> for $70/night, and it was great. The rooms aren't super fancy or modern, but ours had a fireplace, nice vaulted wood ceiling and super nice. If you want a room with a view of the red rocks, try for one of the rooms number 240 or so - they have amazing views.Airport Mesa is THE place that all the tourists come to for the view, but you can get a private view of of the amazing sunset on the red rocks from the viewing area on the hotel property...Definitely worth the stay here! Plus the wireless is great!Stayed there the first week of June in a room on the rim with a deck. Wow! What a place for breakfast and to see the sunset. Very quite and relaxing with a nice pool and attentive staff.Will definitely be my place to stay when in Sedona! The facilities are simple and the atmosphere, view and location are the best in Sedona.","['sky', 'ranch', 'night', 'way', 'grand', 'canyon', 'checked', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'around', 'place',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sedona-summit-sedona,Sedona Summit,3.5,$$,120,"Alan and I just returned from a week's stay at Sedona Summit w/ my brother Jim.  It was our first time staying here.  We owned a timeshare at Los Abrigados before it was bought by Diamond Resorts and have stayed there several times.  Earlier this year we stayed at the Point at Poipu, also a Diamond Resort.  We attended one of their Events of a Lifetime, which culminated in an owners' update at which we decided to switch our timeshare points from the Mainland (Sedona) to Hawaii.  When it was time to plan our Sedona trip we decided to stay at Sedona Summit rather than Los Abrigados.  I must agree w/ the previous reviewers about the timeshare pitches.  After you check in you are herded toward the concierge in an effort to involve you in timeshare updates/sales.  This is true whether you are an owner or not and it's annoying.  We had signed up for a dinner/lunch/outing before arriving.  I wasn't feeling well and we canceled.  They were cooperative w/ that and we appreciated it.  This review would have been 5 stars if it weren't for the not so subtle timeshare pressure and the absolutely unreliable wifi.  Their provider is Windstream and it was out for hours if not days at a time.  Aside from those two caveats our stay was wonderful.  We stayed in room 342 in Building 41.  The apartment was huge, w/ two well appointed master bedroom suites.  Each bedroom had a king size bed.  Linens are the usual high Diamond quality.  The beds were very comfortable, w/ a variety of pillows to choose from.  Jim requested a flatter pillow and one was brought.  There was ample amount of storage space for clothes.  There was even room for suitcases under the beds, as there is on ships, though we stored them in the closets in the entry hall.  The bathrooms had twin hammered copper sinks and large triangular bathtubs as well as showers w/ angular mosaic tile floors which provided secure footing.  Jim's bathroom had the toilet/sink which could be used by company, sliding doors closing it off from the bedroom and the hall.  It had a hammered copper vessel sink.  The toilets are by Toto, although I doubt the toilet seats are Toto, because they don't have the ""soft close"" feature we're used to and we had to be mindful not to drop them.  There are ceiling fans in the bedrooms and the living room, though their speed is not adjustable.  They probably are quite useful in the summer, but not in a cool fall.  The furniture in the living room was very comfortable and the light is good for reading.  There are large flatscreen TVs in bedrooms and living room.  There is a stacked washer/dryer combination in a closet in the hall, which was very convenient.  They provided small boxes of soap.  The kitchen is fully equipped w/ stove, refrigerator and dishwasher.  We requested a tea kettle and it was brought quickly.  As has been our experience w/ Diamond Resorts in the past, the staff were helpful and friendly.  We had a jammed garbage disposal and Kenny and Richard were rocks stars, fixing it like magic.  Jim and Alan had more contact than I did w/ the front desk staff and found them helpful.  They also used the hot tub and other facilities and liked them.  Read as 4.49.  We would return sometime in the future, although we'd check to see whether they have a more reliable wifi provider.  It was free and worth every penny.Everyone please be careful with this hotel!! My friends from Japan stayed at this hotel from July 22nd 2015 to July 24th 2015.My friend booked room 121P.When she checked out of hotel on the 24th, she forgot to pick up her important items (passport,credit cards, and cash) from the safety box. She also left her bag and clothes in the closet. As she started to make her way to PHX, she realized that she forgot her belongings at the hotel, and called but learned that the lost and found office was already closed.The next day she called the hotel again, but the lost and found office staff informed her that they did not find any of her items. This was upsetting to her, so she drove back to the hotel because she felt that her belongings must still be at the hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel the staff was not very open or helpful. She was given the run around when she tried to ask who opened the safety box. The staff eventually told her the housekeeper must have opened it, but did not find anything. My friend went to Sedona police and filed a report at which time the Sedona police contacted hotel in front of her. This is when the hotel staff found her bag and clothes, but continued to claim that there was no passport, credit cards, and cash. After a week, hotel found her passport and credit cards, but not the cash.A week after ??Why?? No cash !? lolI know the fact, staffs were thief. I reported this matter to Diamond Resorts but they totally denied. Sham on Diamond Resort and Sedona Summit Resort. Everyone just be careful with this hotel. Do not left anything at safety box, it not safe!!!!I would actually give this place a 4-star if it wasn't a front for a time-share sales pitch. It was very annoying, and uncalled for.An advice --- When you go there to check in, and they ask you to see concierge for some discounts on something to do around town, say NO THANKS because they are trying to allure you to buy the time-share. Also, you can find better discounts on activities around town on Groupon(Such as PinkJeep,etc. ) Disregard their voice msg left in your room phone...you get my point by now, right? ~_~I won't spend a lot of time on this review.I'm disappointed in a room that should have had two queen beds along with a pull-out sofa in a studio suite.Upon check in I was told none of their rooms have 2 beds.  I then asked if I can be changed to a king bed hoping for a bit more sleeping space. I was told by Brandon due to a full house I could not be accommodated.  Knowing I was upset at check in I was still asked to speak to the concierge to be reeled into a time-share. ugh! not happening!I'll add my positives here only because any negative is definitely bound to have a positive attached.1.  nice room.2.  decor is nicely updated.If you make the mistake and get a room here- DO NOT get sucked into any of the timeshare presentations!! They will offer $75-$100 just to go, and they will say it's not a ""high pressured"" meeting, but it is. It's actually a huge scam that Diamond resorts is running! As far as the rooms here, they are nice... But this company is all about getting you to become an ""owner"". So once you are in their territory- they will constantly bug he crap out of you to try and attend one of these meetings. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. Any location run or owned by Diamond resorts is pathetic and likes to try and scam their guests.Stumbled on this little gem for an impromptu trip. Was pleasantly delighted to see how well kept the grounds are maintained and how much nicer the rooms were given it was one of those timeshare type of resorts. We had a sunset room equipped with everything I needed to feel like a staycation without missing the comforts of home. The bathtub alone made me want to be the star of an adult movie. Staff is stellar and never overly pushy about taking their vacation ownership tours. But if you want to buy in, definitely let Patricia or Leah charm you why you need to invest here. Their infectious smiles and enthusiasm is hard to refuse. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the check-out policy. I've never had a resort make you check out at 10a. Makes no sense to me when you can't even check in the room until after 4p. Perhaps it was busy and overbooked for Father's Day. My suggestion to the the front desk personnel is have some diplomacy and tact when guests inquire about late check-outs. It's not unusual that hotels have check-outs til as late as 4p. Mind you, we would be willing to pay you for that extra beauty sleep. I did appreciate the offer to access the pools until we departed. In any event, this is a wonderful little spot to escape to in our own desert backyard.Great place, wonderful customer service!  I've traveled extensively and this is the most beautiful spot in Sedona.Gracious front desk greeting, easy check-in and lots of people to help with luggage, etc.Friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay!Gorgeous resort! All the amenities you could ask for! Beautiful views! So quiet! Great hiking trails! Would love to come back!The worse experience ever. We stay here three times a year, and their system for booking is terrible, so we book through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> then the front office waves our resort fee since we are members. This time they said they cannot do this. They showed policy for non members booking this way. They would not listen. Next our carpet was worn, we had two different paint colors on the ceiling, and the list goes on. By our unit we had to stand on rocks in the dark BBQing vs a nice slab, and there Wanda rattle snake in the general area. The worse they should had credited me, and said next time we will not do this. Then made a note of this.Pros:-Condo was nice-Pools and resort facilities were solid-DVD rentals Cons:-not within walking distance of anything.  Had to drive into town-hotel manager-diamond resort time share lady was pushyWe had an issue with our neighbor.  I tried to contact the hotel manager about the issue to see if one of us can move,  I never got a call back after calling multiple times.  So that was disappointingAwesome place to visit. Rooms were really nice with all amenities. Infinity jacuzzi was a highlight due to the view of the red rock mountains. This is truly a place to go to retreat from reality. I would go back in a heartbeat.This is a huge disappointment.  First, it is not a resort, but time shares.  Our first clue was a high pressure sales pitch called a ""complementary check-in gift"".  The salesmen are deceptively called concierges and they outnumber the front desk staff 3:1.  They were relentless and rude.  There is no housekeeping-- none-- and the nightly ""resort fee"" pays for absolutely nothing.  Seriously.  Listed amenities are simply public facilities, eg a Safeway, entirely off premises.  All are unaffiliated with the time shares.  Units are somewhat attractive, but views are of other units and parking lots, not scenic in the least.  A busy US highway is less than 30 ft from some bedrooms.  It is aggravating to be in a congested area knowing vast open lands are just out of reach.  If you live in a noisy, densely populated city you will feel at home, but otherwise stay home.  We visit Sedona frequently and enjoyed staying at many other places that are quite an unflattering contrast.  I would not return here if paid to do so.Great motel at a great price. We ended up paying 136.00 for one night. Pros: - laundry facility free on site (just but detergent, but front desk said just ask and they will give you detergent for free)- nice pools with separate adult pool- my room had a nice kitchen with large fridge and freezer- nice staff- DVD player (we rented red box at Walgreens a few miles away)- pools were very cleanCons: - concierge tries too sell you another vacation (like the blue suit people in Vegas)- hot water takes awhile to come on- bad lighting to room at night (room 129p)Good stay for the price.I would give it a 4-5 stars, if they had not acted like jerks while checking us in. We had booked two condos, of the same type, in the same property. But it took us 30 mins of back and forth arguing before they gave us 2 close to each other. They clearly had those available but somehow had made up their mind to not give those to us and were giving us condos in two different properties. We had kids and family with us and that us not acceptable to us. No amount of evidence would convince them, but finally we pointed out the logical flaws in their excuses and managed to convince them. Seemed like they were doing us a favor by giving us what we had paid for.Overall the resort was nice. I might go stay there again.The only unit available was a studio, which is okay for 2 people but no more than that as it is small and dark. Could use some updating too.Housekeeping never showed up for the weekly ""cleaning"" and towel restocking. When we notified front desk they said they would let them know but no one ever showed up. The front desk person was also very rude and had an attitude on the phone when I called with some questions about our stay. Didn't appreciate the $25 daily resort fee when nothing was done for us- we had to empty our trash, go to front desk for more towels,missed out on the weekly cleaning; not sure what we were paying for. Sedona and Oak Creek are gorgeous, but our stay at this resort was disappointing.Love Diamond Resorts. Since my sister in law is a member we always go. The unit we had was A ONE Bedroom and the room we had was the studio. So nice and there where multiple pools. We ended up walking up a few units to the big pool and hot tub. At night you could see the Milky Way and all the shooting stars. Amazing!!We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!!! Our room was beautiful, very comfy beds..... the little pool and hot tub were PERFECT and just steps away from our door. The views around the complex are breathtaking and there is an easy short walk to some trail heads and a gorgeous hill to watch the sunset. Location is just a mile or so from the ""Uptown"" area. You walk there, but it's hilly and several miles. Great places to eat in the area as well. We did visit the ""Indian Jewelry"" show - which was very over-priced. Skip that. I was able to attend the Guided Meditation session (with Crystal singing bowls) and I have to say it was one of the most beautiful experiences of my life. (i'm very much into Yoga and Meditation!). What I didn't appreciate was that after class, the instructor pushed her ""new CDs"" on the class to buy. Kind of ruined my Zen... Can't wait to return to the beautiful area and really enjoyed my time there.I understand that not too many rooms have a ""views"" but even though our room faced the parking lot our long distance view was breathtaking. Don't accept the welcome packet and they never bother you about the timeshare speech.We booked our room through VROB so we used someone's timeshare. We have a two bedroom lockout and it was awesome. The place is about two miles out of downtown Sedona. Not too far and not too close to the hustle and bustle of the town. I'd definitely stay here again.My family and I had a great time at this resort. Services were very good. Staff was very friendly.I came here with my boyfriend and his family for Memorial Day weekend and it was a very enjoyable visit!  There were 14 of us and we managed to fit comfortably in two rooms.  If you're planning on coming with a big group like us, they're likely to set up a one bedroom suite connecting to a studio that has a queen-sized bed along with a sofa which could be made into a bed.  The studios also had their own fully stocked kitchenette.  The bedroom had a HUGE bathroom with a shower stall along with a nice jacuzzi.  Too bad my boyfriend and I couldn't get that room :P  The living room has a sofa bed as well and a dining table.  The kitchen was fully stocked and much bigger than the ones in the studio.  Throughout the resort, you can find plenty of things to do.  They had several pools at different spots.  The jacuzzi is nicely heated and it wasn't so excruciatingly hot that you had to get out of there 5 minutes after you had just gotten in.   There was a much bigger pool which had a waterfall down the street from our room but it was closed.  You can also play ping pong, shuffle board, pool, and many more games at the activity center.  You can also play with an enlarged chess board and horseshoe where the kids playground is.  I've been to a few timeshare resorts now and this is one of the great ones! It's not the best but definitely spacious and family-friendly! The staff is awesome and helpful.  I would definitely come back if we decided to get a timeshare.","This place is awesome, great staff.  We stayed 1 week in a 2 bedroom suite.  It was fantastic.  The staff came by and asked if they could refresh our towels and gave us more supplies.  The room was gorgeous.  The grounds were great. My kids and I played checkers on the life-size checker board, hit golf balls on the mini range, played ping pong, pool and bumper pool sat in the sun and swam in the pool.  I loved having my breakfast outside on the patio and playing games that we brought with us. We hiked several trails we had never been on before.My only complaint is that cell service isn't that good in Sedona, but that is not the resorts problem, it is Sedona in general. We own a timeshare so we had no issue with the presentation thing.Stay at Sedona summit!! They're rooms are beautiful and the resort is very accommodating. We were so impressed, I'm not a diamond member, but after our stay we are strongly considering. I am so happy that we found this gem. Don't listen to the negative reviews, you have to see it for yourself. Thanks again for our wonderful stay and to Nina for signing us up for the seminar. It's definitely worth it to go and check out what Diamond has to offer!This is our home away from home. We come to Sedona and stay at the summit every time. The suites are beautiful and homey. They will accommodate in anyway they can. I always cook while we are here, so if I need any type of dish or utensils they make it happen. The staff is wonderful and attentive. We really love the fact that you can check out games at the activity center and keep them for 3 days. I highly recommend this place!We stayed here for a week, and loved it. We had our 9month old with us. The laundry room was convenient. We were on the first floor and the person above us had a child who ran around in the morning but it wasnt too bad. I went to check out the special guest who made flutes. He taught us a history lesson about the Native American flute and brought many of them to do a  demonstration. Sedona was amazing and staying here made it a great trip.First, the good. Helpful, friendly grounds and maintenance staff. The view from one of the jacuzzis, one which of course was not near our room, but we made a trek to visit. Second, the not so good. If you are looking for a romantic getaway with a fireplace, THIS IS NOT IT. Although it is advertised they have a fireplace,  it is in fact a screen that plays a video of a fire. Awesome. (note sarcasm) Killed a big part of the romantic theme I had wanted for my VDay getaway with my SO. I specifically looked for a place equipped with one and was completely disappointed.The beds are hard as rocks. Perfect if you prefer that type of firmness in a bed, however I do not. Two nights I tossed and turned and woke up sore as can be. If we had not taken so much stuff I would have packed everything back up and headed over to the Hyatt or a cabin where they do have real fireplaces. It also seems the hot water is controlled. I could only get the shower fixture over so far before it stopped and the water never got steamy. Cheapos. You couldn't sell me on a timeshare here for nothing. There are so many  better options in Sedona for what I paid, I know I could've done better.To start, this place has some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. We asked for early check in and showed up at 2 for check in, they told us that are room wasn't ready until 4 and that they had no proof of our reservation. We waited around till 4 for the room to still no be ready until 5. When finally checking in the man up front said that it was not his problem. When finally checking in we pulled out the coach to find 2 little COACH ROACHES in the bed. The place is a cheap price for a reason and even though it will work for a night I wouldn't suggest wasting your money but to rather spend 20-40 more and actually enjoy your time!I have been a Platinum Diamond Resort member for many years and decided to gift my daughter and her friend a stay at the Sedona Summit this past weekend. Everything was fine with check in, they had to wait a little longer for a room to be available, but once they went back to the unit after dinner they discovered 2 COCKROACHES in the bathroom.  They called the front desk who said that there are no rooms available to move them to since the resort is at full capacity for the weekend. They said a maintenance man could come take care of the roaches, but that they are not ""authorized"" to spray the unit. Once the maintenance guy showed up, he mocked my daughter and friend saying that they were over exaggerating , claiming that this is very common in all units since we are in the desert, and to be ""happy it wasn't a snake"". An hour later, they found another HUGE cockroach in the bathroom and called the front desk demanding to switch units (this is now 1 AM). they said they had a room that they could transfer us to . So in other words they lied the first time they requested to move. Once they were in the new room , they found a large dead cockroach in the bathroom. the next morning they found another dead on the carpet, and that evening found one dead near their luggage on the floor. I am guessing they sprayed the unit quickly before my daughter moved into the second room.They ended their trip short and left Sunday night because they could not handle staying in a roach infested room and went to the front desk to check out. The front desk gentleman did not even flinch when we described our experience and just brushed it off . Overall, I was completely embarrassed and shocked that my daughter and her friend had such a horrible experience with a resort that I spoke so highly about. For such a great resort you would think they would take better care of their guests and maintain a clean atmosphere.Found a good deal online for this resort. It's not as nice as other places I've stayed but it did the job. It's nice how there is a kitchen and a full size fridge. There are lots of pools and hot tubs which is nice. We didn't get a good view room but there are a lot of rooms that look like they would have a beautiful view.Aftwr booking a reservation explicitly wanting to be away from kids. The room we got was next to the 21+ pool.  But later that night guests check in with a screaming baby.So we requested to move to another room. And got onebwith a broken closet and a broken toilet.  After a day of fun hiking. We returned to yet a family of 5 kids next to us who kept trying to open our door. While our other party was put across the hall/walkway.  Worst service in sedona.Stood here 2 nights with my boyfriend &amp; we loved it! You can't beat a resort studio with everything you need. Refrigerator, stove, microwave, dishwasher, sink, kitchen table, pull out sofa, and balcony. It was perfect. Our view of the red rocks from our balcony was honestly amazing. I'd stay here again!On a weekend trip to Sedona from Tucson. Reserved a studio, huge bathroom, shower with a tub, all in excellent condition. Great kitchenette, nice to have to save a bit on eating out.Living room couch a plus, with dining room table with 4 chairs.Bed comfy and ceiling fan a real plus.The pool and hot tub were close by and welcome after we came back from dinner.The wifi is free,A number of items would have made this five stars:Closet doors were off the tracks,Not clear where the living room wastebasket was,Bathroom make up area a real plus, yet there was no stool or chair, had to bring a chair from the kitchen table,The web site descriptions of the room choices are not very detailed.The phone signal, ATT, none in the room, erratic in the parking lot, be aware,Update: this morning my wife talked to the manager, Scott Lopez, who was very attentive, apologized for the inconvenience and accepted the room was not in good condition to stay. He even stepped outside to go to the car where I was waiting for my wife to apologize. He offered a compensation on the spot. I can tell he does care for the satisfaction of his customers. Too bad he wasn't on duty last night when the incident happened. I'll update the 1 star rating once the compensation gets credited.Spent the weekend in Sedona for my birthday. The resort made it a great one! Excellent customer service. Very hospitable. A lot of fun activities to do. From the pool to hiking, arts and crafts, meditation, yoga, concierge is willing to help you plan a fun vacation. Everything was clean and presentable. View was amazing and breathtaking. Complimentary cake's (plural)!We booked our rooms through Airbnb-loved it! Great rooms(connecting rooms), terrific customer service from front desk, attention to detail from beautiful landscaping , fitness room, and pools. We will definitely be staying here next time we visit Sedona. Located in West Sedona.We stayed here for 2 nights while in Sedona. Our rooms were nice with a kitchenette and enough room for us. The grounds are very nice and I appreciated that they had several pools so it was not too crowded. I recommend the pool with the waterfall and infinity spa as it was the largest and nicest. I didn't like that they are using Styrofoam cups in the lobby for coffee and tea... it's 2015 we should be beyond that. Would stay here againMy entire family booked rooms at this resort for my wedding. We booked the our room months ahead of time. Showed up a couple hours after our check-in time, got our keys, got to our room, and it hadn't even been cleaned yet. We were told by housekeeping to wait outside or we could come back in an hour or so. I called the front desk, so they would know there's some sort of miscommunication over which rooms are actually ready and the concierge was very rude about it. The room itself looked like it hadn't been redecorated or remodeled since 1983.  Frankly, you might as well stay at a Holiday Inn or other chain hotel rather than this resort.  You would save money, get better customer service, and have a room that's just as comfortable, if not more so.LOVED our stay at Sedona Summit! Got a 1 bedroom....and it was HUGE! Full kitchen, dining area, living room that has a queen sized sofa pull-out, washer/dryer unit....THEN you still have a FULL MASTER SUITE! Jacuzzi tub that's SEPARATE from the shower???? WHAT?! We happened to be in building 11, which had a little mini-putt putt, a kids playground, big chess/checkers board, and horse-shoe. Walk yo the little hill, and we have an adult only 21+ Serenity pool and hot tub. Walk across the road and there's a big family pool and a big spa atop. Walk down the parking lot, and there's 3 huge propane BBQ grills. Great customer service from check-in to check-out. Anna, Patricia and Patricia at Concierge were SUPER knowledgable and fun. If you're looking to go to Sedona, make SURE you look at staying at Sedona Summit!We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights at this 'resort'  as a 1 day break from our week &amp; a half driving tour of the south west. At first glance, the accommodations seem fine, but as you look closer, you can see the wear and tear. I would suggest you avoid the concierge like the plague--the time share speech made me miss out on pool time with the kids. I was amused by the ""american Indian jewelry"" sale...The resort was packed...many people at the pools. However, we did enjoy a dip &amp; my boys liked the activity center's ping pong table, pool table &amp; foosball. On the plus side, the suite's bed was comfortable, there were plenty of pillows &amp; towels, and the room was clean.Avoid this place !  You'll get accosted with a time share presentation. Don't go here. I made the mistake :(Excellent customer service, Scott the manager at the front desk went the extra mile to make our stay really enjoyable and memorable. Great view from the valley-facing jacuzzi, excellent knowledge and help from the concierge staff. Again, Scott is a top-notch guy and the primary reason that we will be staying here again when we visit next year, we appreciate how much you care about doing a great thing for your customers thank you!","Its a nice property the rentals are very dated. The most uncomfortable furniture I ever sat on. The bed was good. The HIGH PRESSURE sales was a big turnoff. This is a timeshare place. Have know idea what most of the light switch's do. PS this chair is killing my back. The chair and couch could have been a medieval torture device.Booked a room about 1 month in advance. My room was supposedly ""guaranteed for late arrival"". When I got to the front desk to check in around 7pm I was told the hotel overbooked. I wanted a refund so the concierge who was helping me went to look for the manager. 20 mins later the same concierge (NOT the manager) told me I was being walked to another hotel and that I was being upgraded. Got to the new hotel and it's a run down dump. Called Sedona Summit to complain and spoke to the manager. I didn't catch her name but she told me that's all she could do and hung up. Disorganized, lack of communication, ignorant concierge.I'm not sure how we booked this place since it's a timeshare and we're not owners.  The place has the feel of condos/apartments with several small pools. It is on the outer edge of Sedona. Each unit has a kitchen with cooking equipment - it's great because the restaurants in Sedona aren't especially interesting after you've been in town for a few days. According to the pictures some units are pretty posh. Ours was not. It was about the quality of a 90's style apartment. Not bad, but could use a refreshing.  I guess the nicer units have views. We did not.The concierge will repeatedly leave messages on your unit phone to come pick up your welcome pack. That's just an excuse for them to try and talk you into a timeshare. Skip that part if you hate being sold stuff. Overall it was a comfy place to use as home base while we went on hikes and explored the town. I wouldn't think of it as a destination in itself though, as the sales people suggest. The best part was being able to cook my own meals after days on the road. And the unit has a washer/dryer.I am so happy with this place. Our studio is so comfy and clean and the staff is absolutely wonderful! So nice and helpful. We love the location! Close to the middle of town but not directly in town. The views just from our room are breathtaking! Laundry rooms and a great activity center where you can rent movies. The concierge has tons of maps for whatever you are looking to do. Dined tonight at Dahl and Di luca after comcierge recommended it and it was amazing! We are loving our time here so far and would definitely stay at a diamond resort again :)Incredible resort to stay in. As a testament to how incredible it is - while we checked in for only two nights, we extended by two more nights. All of the staff are great, very positive experience with check-in and concierge folks. Want to make a call out to Ashley at the front desk, and Ashley - her manager. Very patient, friendly, and wanting to make you, the guest, feel welcome. As an added bonus - and this came as a welcome surprise - resort provides free access to a day spa at one of their sister properties. Very welcome relaxation after a long day of hiking.This is our first trip to Sedona and we are so happy we came!  Our room here at the resort is really nice.  Easy check-in process, easy to find our room, and very comfortable accommodations.  We like to do some cooking while on the road and the kitchen is well-stocked to do so.  Wifi is an additional fee but it's a strong connection. The view from our room is part resort and part mountain range.  We also like to use the fitness room and this one is well outfitted with four cardio machines, free weights and other weight machines.  There seem to be pools at every corner of the resort.  We had a small problem with our shower door that was resolved quickly by the maintenance staff.  The resort is just outside the west side of town where you can find Safeway, Walgreens, the movie theater, and many restaurant choices.  If we get a chance to come back to Sedona, we'll definitely stay here.This resort is beautiful, and would have been even better if we hadn't had four days of incessant rain, some snow, and freezing temps.  Still, the quality of the fixtures in the unit made for a wonderful stay.The kitchen has stainless-steel appliances, and the small ones are all Cuisinart:  blender, toaster, electric can opener.  There is no dedicated dining area or table, but the kitchen has an oversized granite island that doubles as the dining table.  The bathroom is bigger than many NYC studio apartments!  We loved the jetted bubble tub, the shower big enough for four, and the hammered copper sink on the granite-topped vanity.We had a one-bedroom unit.  The bedroom was on the small side, but with plenty of storage and a comfortable bed; the living room was also small, but big enough for our purposes.  One complaint is that the sofa wasn't comfortable and I slid down each time I tried to sit on it, and the two arm chairs were way too deep.  There is also no real coat closet, just a closed, very shallow cabinet containing the ironing board and a pull-out, sort of like a tie rack, for hanging a coat or two at most.  The problem was that since we had so much rain, we couldn't hang the wet jackets in that cabinet, so the stool backs had to be our coat rack.Maintenance was terrific:  it seemed as if we had problems with a few light bulbs - in the bathroom and on the patio - that were out.  Both times maintenance came immediately.  But it turned out that the light bulbs weren't out.  The recessed bulb over the bathtub, which looks like every other recessed fixture in the bathroom, turned out to have its own switch, which we didn't notice until it was pointed out.  Likewise, the patio, which had two recessed bulbs (and a ceiling fan - nice touch!), had a separate switch in the bedroom for the second bulb, which again we hadn't noticed.  It would have been helpful if the info sheet we got at check-in had this information, or if there were small signs near these switches.  It would also have helped save maintenance from those two trips to our unit.Despite the near-freezing temperatures and the rain, my husband and other guests took advantage of the heated pool and the hot tub, which was open until around 10 p.m.  When the sun finally came out, on our fifth day, there was a gorgeous view of Sedona's red rocks from the pool area.Lack of connectivity was a major problem.  We were told early on that our carrier, AT&amp;T, had almost no service in Sedona, and we found this true not only at the resort, but many places in town.  That, and the very spotty wi-fi, made it very difficult, because we were trying to conduct some business while we were there, and time was of the essence.  Luckily, it all worked out, but not without some harrowing moments.Re the timeshare presentation:  we were offered first-class tickets on the Verde Valley Railway for the discounted price of $71 and change.  We bit.  The next night, before the train ride, we met some people who told us that another timeshare resort gave them the same first-class tickets for free.  My husband went back to the person whom we dealt with, and she did refund what we had paid.  We managed to get through the presentation in less than two hours, only because of our unique timeshare situation.  They released our prison bonds when they were smart enough to realize that there was no way on God's green earth they were going to sell us a timeshare.We have stayed in many timeshare resorts, and they are always varied in their amenities and the quality of the units.  Overall, Sedona Summit was a winner, and we wouldn't hesitate to go back.  Just not in January!Wife, baby, and I really enjoyed it.  Very clean, great amenities, super friendly staff.  Relocation nice right by red rock state park as wellNice place, good location and comfy bed! We were luck enough to use someone elses time share for the weekend that they couldn't use and it was a great expereince. The check in desk was very nice and helpful and the room was clean and nicely stocked. The grounds were nice and we were able to sit on our patio and have a great view of the red rocks. They give you a calender of events and classes that they have but we were not there long enough to take advantage of any of them but they look fun.We really enjoyed our 4 night, 5 day stay at Sedona Summit.  Keep in mind, however, that we had read a lot of reviews about how terrible and forceful the Concierge is re: timeshare presentations, so we avoided the front desk like it was the plague.  Aside from checking in and checking out, we didn't visit the front desk at all.    We did, however, receive two voicemails about a ""welcome packet"" the concierge had for us but we just ignored them.  We heard from another couple that the 1.5 hours the concierge promises you for the presentation is actually 4 hours, so we are really glad we didn't take a chance.We asked for a room with a view, and that is what we got.  Building 1 Room 203P is great in terms of location and wifi access.  We read that other guests couldn't access wifi at all, but we had no problems with it.  Our room was a studio, which was smaller than the pictures indicated, but fine for two.  The appliances all worked and they had a few I wouldn't have guessed they'd have, like a blender and mechanical wine bottle opener.  They also had a dishwasher.  I would have preferred more utensils, but no big deal.  They make sure to leave dishwasher detergent, soap for handwashing dishes, extra garbage bags and an extra paper towel roll too.    Bathroom was clean, shower was great.  TV worked fine. We really had no issues at all.  Parking got full but was never totally full that you couldn't find a spot.  The view of the rocks is amazing from the hotel.  Oh, we also used the Jacuzzi every night and had no issues with it.  The temperature of the water was great for the cool evenings.   The pool was supposedly heated, but it was kind of cold, even on one of the days where it felt like 75 degrees.  It didn't seem like many people were using the pool or Jacuzzi, but it is the end of February so it was a little bit cooler out anyways and that could have been why.All in all, I would definitely recommend Sedona Summit.We stayed here for a few nights.  We found out that this was a time share property and ended up going to a meeting to learn more about it.  The sales people were not too aggressive.  Room was cozy.  Nice comfortable bed, decent shower room with the tub, small living room and a tiny kitchen that we never used because we ate out everyday.  Gave it 3 stars, we specifically picked this place hoping we would get a room with a view, I guess those are offered to people who own a property and on their site, the pool looked huge, with the jacuzzi... It was Tiny!   Plus, we were on the first floor and we heard every single thing they did upstairs!  Annoying!Study unit location, our unit was at the corner of two highways with noise all night.  Well appointed unit somewhat dated.  Good price point.We rolled into Sedona and used Expedia to book a room here, including the resort fee (this is added after booking so beware) total was $140/night.Pros* Nice rooms, nothing special but it was clean, comfortable, roomy compared to a standard hotel room, and had a kitchen and a little patio area.* Decent fitness center and the pools and hot tub look nice, but we didn't use them so I can't comment further. * Free wifi, although a bit slow.Cons* Check-in - the lady at the front desk looked like she was on drugs or very tried She couldn't keep her eyes open and couldn't find our reservation in the computer because she couldn't spell our name right.  We ended up waiting 30 minutes before someone with a higher ranking came out and helped. The checkin process took way to long.* Check-out - is at 10AM and I called to see if we could stay longer sine we rolled in so late and they weren't very accommodating, only willing to go to 11AM. * No cell phone service. This is a must. I'm not sure how folks can stay here for a week without phone service.* View - No view from our room.Stayed here for 5 days and have been to many other timeshares. The place over all was nice with good views. If you have AT&amp;T don't expect service. If you aren't a diamond member then you'll have to pay 22 dollars for internet that is the speed of dial up and has a super weak signal. Half the tv channels didn't work and the others had such bad signal they cut in and out all the time. I saw it on other tvs in other rooms as well. Hard to do business in my roomToday marks our 5th day in Sedona, AZ at summit. The experience has been really good so far other then a few problems but nothing to big. My wife and I came here with the whole family. By that I mean 3 adults 3 kids and a baby. The first problem is there are only a minimal amount of grills. I found only 3 and one doesn't work. So for some it is a very long hike if you want to grill. The second problem was with at the pools. If you have kids swimming under 18 then you have to been present at all times. My kids which is a 11, 13 and 16 year old went to the pool about ten minutes prior to us arriving got kicked out because we were not present to watch them swim. But I can see why that is a concern for insurance reasons. As far as the amenities and resorts grounds are concerned they are great. I believe there are 5 pools with spas and one big spa. The concierge was very nice and informational. We currently use RCI as our timeshare host but decided to see what diamond had to offer. They are extremely expensive and in our opinion not worth it at this time. We didn't find them pushy at all and when we said we didn't think it was a good move at this time they gave us some information and their card if we ever decided to go to diamond and that was all. We received a 2 night 3 day stay at a few places and a free 100 dollar gift card to a restaurant of our chose. I've already talked about the grills but you can get grilling utensils at the front desk but do not have a brush with them. All in all we enjoyed our stay here besides the 110 degree temperature outside. I do recommend summit resort. Hope you enjoyed this review have a great stayWe stayed in a one-bedroom suite for a week and loved it!  The bathroom was huge and had both a large jacuzzi tub and a walk-in shower.  The appliances and furniture were also very modern.  My favorite part of the resort was the infinity hot tub, about the size of a small swimming pool.  It was part of the ""family hot tub/pool"", but the noise of the waterfalls kept a relatively serene, peaceful ambiance. The two things that were a little strange to us were that our fireplace seemed to be emitting cold air and that most of the resorts pools/hot tubs were being remodeled the week we were there.  Otherwise, we loved the gorgeous views of the night stars and Red Rocks!My boyfriend and I stayed there this weekend for Memorial Day.  The place was pretty beautiful.  The room was a nice size and the location was nice.  There was a beautiful area for star gazing behind our building which was quiet and very dark.  The only part I really didn't like was that we only stayed for one night and within that time found three cockroaches in our room.  It was a little uncomfortable going to bed knowing that there were that many cockroaches around.  If you plan to stay here, just know you might have some uninvited bugs staying with you also!We stayed there as hotel guests , not time share,Check in is at 4 pm,we got to our room@ 4:45,Check out is 10 am,they clean rooms , every five days,room was great,amenities were good,service was POORSo we check in to our room , the place is beautiful, but somewhat overwhelmed by the surrounding natural beauty of the Sedona mountains. Everything is great, checking the town out, doing some spectacular hiking, eating some great food at one of the many food establishments in the area. But, the second day there, we're required to attend the ""time share presentation"". This is where everything went bad! I am already a Diamond resort owner, have spent thousands already, so when the ""vacation counselor"" was introduced to us, I told him straight out from the get go that "" I am not buying anything today, that we just came cuz I had to, to get the free 4day/3night vacation.  He then tells me "" we'll I don't want to waste my time"" or your time. I say good, we are on the same page. I then ask if we're done then, and "" can we go now"". He says it's not that easy, so we sit down at a table. He scribbles some numbers    On some paper, and for the third time he tells me"" I don't want to waste my time"". But, before he can finish the sentence, I cut him off, and said"" your wasting my time, telling me that your not going to waste my time""! At this point he said I was rude, unprofessional, and that he never had to deal with someone  like me before. He also told me that he had been doing this a loooooong time. I ask how long, he says ""five years"". That is not long!  So after he gets up and bring the next person in line, she isn't much better telling my fiance to ""tone it down "" as she tried to explain to her the situation. Not good! She then brings the manager, and she was great. Donna, I believe . The guy that""helped"" me, his name is Sue David Ono. A ""boy named Sue""!  He actually looked at my fiance and asked her"" you wanna be with this guy""! He told me if I don't sit here and listen to presentation, he was gonna charge me full price for the room. I told him "" bullshit""!  He told me again and I said ""bullshit"" again. He said if I cussed one more time that it would be over, and they would charge me full price. I told him what, ""there aren't any kids here, what, are your virgin ears bleeding?"" I then said "" bullshit"". I then told him that by telling anybody that they would have to pay full price, it would make them angry, and that it would make me angry! He told me"" I would like to see that"" basically calling me out. He said "" I'd like to see what happened if you got angry!"" I told him "" read some police reports or any newspaper and you'll see what can happen when people get angry. The guy insulted me. So when the manager came over I calmly told her1. I am already an owner, is this how you treat your owners?2. I have spent thousands already (paid off loan)I.e. Maintenance fees, points fees3.I'm not going to buy anything today! Finally after that, she cut us loose. This guy Sue Ono, who goes by David, what I would call a prima Donna , who never has had his soft hands dirty. I'm guessing a college grad, trying to sell timeshares. Good job Sue! Not! I hope Diamond resorts reads this so they can take the appropriate action towards a BOY named Sue!Where do I start! We checked in on a Sat and were sent to the wrong kind of room. I am mobility impaired and needed an ADA room, we went back to the desk, they apologized and moved us. We got into the second Studio unit and it was perfect. Nice layout and space for 2 people. In the first 18 hours the AC quit 3 times. This was in September, maintenance was quick to respond and so nice. After the 3rd time my husband went to the front desk and they upgraded up to a better unit that was amazing! They also sent someone over to help us pack and move. Kim at the front desk ROCKS! We had a small issue with parking but Kim and the GM took care of it. They also sent over a gift basket when they found out it was our 10th anniversary. The pool areas were awesome and we spent every night in one of the spas.Thing happen that are out of our control and are no fault of anyone. What defines a business is how they handle the customer service end of it. These guys were great. We will be back! It was a perfect celebration of our marriage and was that much better because of this resort and their staff.I gave 4 stars because I had no cell coverage at the resort, but the second we pulled out to the light I had 5 bars. The service was being intentionally blocked to sell their internet coverage, in my opinion. Which I refused to pay for. Free wifi and cell phone access would have given them 5 stars.","Booked a room here for one night in January, but cancelled in advance of the 2 day requirement due to a change in plans.  Then I discovered charges for 2 nights on my credit card.  Called the hotel and received a complete run around even after they acknowledged my cancellation in advance.  Contesting the charges and keeping this hotel off my list.  Beware in working with this hotel and check all charges on your bill.Really nice place too bad we only stayed one day. Multiple pools great view and we had a two room condo very nice!!! Would be nice if they had a restaurant onsite. I would defiantly come back but is a little pricy. But you only get what you pay for.We had a two-bedroom suite with a gorgeous view of the red rocks. There was great hiking and trails right out the back of the property. The inside of the suite was very nice and very modern. My wife loved the fixtures in the bathrooms. Only complaint she has is that the steak knives have sucked at every Diamond Resort. Other than that, though, the staff was wonderful, the pools were great, kids had fun at the activity center and we just LOVED it there. Sedona Summit will be seeing these Californians quite a bit.We are owners and this is our third visit here (we live in Chandler). This time we have the larger one bedroom on the first floor. Very nice space except that it needs better soundproofing! We hear very step of the people upstairs which is pretty annoying. It's a bit dark in here but some prefer that I guess--at least in the summer. This area is spacious enough. We've also had the smaller one bedroom and it's a little cramped. That time we had noisy neighbors in the adjoining (locked) bedroom and that was really annoying. If you stay here your best bet is the 2bedroom kickoff ion the second level. We had our best stay there because noise was not an issue.Beautiful room, great bathroom, abundant storage and spectacular views! We really enjoyed our stay and would have stayed longer if our work schedules had allowed it! The only reason I didn't give this resort 5 stars is because there is not a restaurant on site therefore, no room service; I would have loved to wake up and enjoy breakfast in bed! Next time we will be sure to bring snacks and maybe make a grocery store run! Can't wait to stay here again!We came here expecting it to be as nice as the Hawaii time share....wrong.The consIt's so far out and away from everything absolutely nothing close enough to walk to, you get in your car and drive everywhere..No restaurant on the propertyThe concierges pretend they're there to help you but really they're trying to get you to attend a sales presentation.  (We didn't bite and after reading others exp. I'm glad we didn't.Internet service is almost non existent.Cell phone service was horrible.The couch/sofa bed was the most uncomfortable you could ever sit on.We arrived early and was told they would call when room was ready, of course they didn't.Our view was the side of the buildingThe prosComfortable bedCleanMidweek maid serviceTV workedNice gymGame room with ping pong, pool and moreNice laundromatThat's about itWould I stay here again, probably notHad a great stay, the shallow kiddie pool was a huge plus!  Great service all around, they even had bbq tools for us to borrow.  Well appointed room and the entire family loved the jetted tub.  Only thing was out daughter was able to easily open front door and run out, good thing mommy was quick on her feet!  Overall great stay!Disappointed with my experience at this hotel.  We arrived early to the hotel and asked if the room was ready, and they said no but that they would put priority on it to help us get in early. After an hour we went back and they said it still wasn't ready. 15 minutes before 4 the room wasn't ready. At 4 the gentleman had to call out to see if the room was ready and proceeded to ask us if we would like to be upstairs or downstairs. I was confused why we had options, since we had waited for so long. I understand that we arrived early so I shouldn't expect that we could get into our room earlier, but I was disappointed because while waiting I saw families and couples all getting to go into their room earlier, which made me upset, because I didn't understand why we had to wait.  One lady came up to us and said we could use the pool, which was nice but everything was packed in our car. I do think their concierge part was nice, she helped us find some nice locations to go too. Our room was next to a family and we were able to hear all the kids, which I understand is uncontrollable. Also, they have poor connection to the Internet, and an additional charge of 12 + tax for using the pool and Internet per day, which I didn't know until we arrived after prepaying for our trip. Overall, I am disappointed in the Sedona Summit, because of the poor service we received when coming to the hotel. I felt  that we were treated differently from the other couples arriving to the hotel early because we were younger.Great place ... Very clean and comfortable and the pools/spas are well maintained and relaxing ... Recommend highly !!!Actually, a beautiful property. Traded in through RCI so we got a studio for our usual 1 bedroom.  Kitchen area was a bit smaller than we are use to, but workable.  My one complaint was no bathtub.   But overall the room was quite comfortable.  If we come back I will try for a 1 bedroom.We did sit through the timeshare presentation to get a discount on a jeep tour we booked through the concierge.  The 90 min stretched to 3.5 hours!!!!    They toured us through the two and three bedroom rooms so we could see they were very nice.  But it was a very long drawn out presentation.We went in the winter.  One of the nice things is that we use the hot tub in the evening  which was kept warm, even though the temperature outside was below 17 degrees F.   The pool is also kept heated, but we did not venture in.What a beautiful resort!  We are Diamond owners so I consider ourselves lucky to have access to such a beautiful resort.  From the customer service to the amenities, I feel like you can't ask for anything more!  One of the best things we enjoyed on this visit was the grills on site near our room &amp; I notice about a dozen people loveing the hot tubs next to the grills! If you get a chance to here, do it! I'm already planning our next stay!It is a good resort, but (unless you have a room with a view, maybe) nothing to write home about.  Services was reasonably accommodating, the did move us to a quieter room . BTW, if you are sensitive to noise, do NOT stay on the 1st floor!Location was great - easy to Sedona restaurants and to all the hiking. Everything was clean and functional, just what you expect at a time share resort. Their sales pitches weren't as numerous or as aggressive as we've seen in the past at other places, so nothing to complain about here.Ah, yes, one thing: their wifi (by AT&amp;T) is sloooooow and barely working, pretty much anywhere in the resort. Just assume no wifi :-)I stayed in a studio with no extra rooms. Upon arrival during check-in my girlfriend was bugged by the concierge trying to force you to pay for more things you don't really need. Thank god she is pretty outgoing and put them in their place pretty quickly. That was the end of that problem. Apparently wifi costs money because it is AT&amp;T wifi. Somehow the lady who checked us in have us a code for free wifi for the weekend. Once we reached the room we were very impressed to how how nice the room was and the amenities that were offered. We had every appliance except an oven. The room was very quaint and perfect for a couple on a vacation. There was a nice flat screen TV which is always nice. The bathroom was great and offered a shower with a sink and toilet. There is no bath though. No couples baths on vacation.  Sorry guys. We were on the second floor and there was a balcony. The view was great from it. There is two pools here. One is an adult pool that offers a nice spa. Everything was quite impressive. I would definitely come back.Sunset suite is FABULOUS. Clean, new, luxurious, comfortable. Huge jacuzzi, huge shower, fireplace, patio. Just a very comfortable accommodation!Met my kids here to swim and jacuzzi. Had a great time. The area was clean and equipped with a clean restroom. The pool was a bit cold but the jacuzzi was perfect. They also had a small pool for toddlers. I stayed with them for about 3 hours. Never had a problem w/ management. They were very visible, nice security. Made us all feel safe having them drive around in their golf carts.While in Tucson, I decided to attend a conference in Sedona:  I was under the gun, as hotels were booking up quickly for the event.  After a very arduous search for a decent, and affordable hotel, I decided upon the Sedona Summit Resort. I booked through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>. I thought they were offering a good deal for the 5-night stay, and loved that they were offering a visa gift card 'rebate,' which made it much more affordable. I was told to stay at a hotel on 89A, but I am really glad I chose to stay here. I like that it was located just before the center of town. Less traffic, less noise. Reviews suggested it could get quite loud, so I requested a room with a mountain view and that was in a quieter area, near the adult pool. They werent able to give me a room with a view (I imagine they save those for their current and prospective time share owners, and also for the bigger suites they have. Despite that my room was really nice! Turned out it didnt matter about the view b/c I was kept so busy at the conference I never had a moment to take the hotel view in. (I more than made up for that on the last day, with my own personal vortex tour- which was awesome- but that's another story!)It's a huge property! They have 5 pools, 2 infinity jacuzzis- 1 with a rocks and a waterfall built around it- and at least 1 other jacuzzi in the adult pool area. (I went on my own personal jacuzzi tour too. :)I loved that the adult pool area was truly honored as 'adults only.' It was much quieter, more tranquil and darker. The stargazing from the adult pool area was pretty spectacular. As one of my favorite pasttimes this was pretty cool! I didnt enjoy how rowdy the kids were in the jacuzzis, or how the parents were allowing them to splash and jump around the other patrons. I think it's important for families to have a fun time, but their fun shouldnt come at the cost of mine. Since those areas had the nicest hottubs, I had to endure it. I was actually a bit appalled by one of the patrons who was throwing his son across the hottub very close other people/me, and then teaching him that having a good time screaming and playing was an indication that he was behaving like a little 'B-I-T-C-H.' Yes, he spelled it out- probably to protect his son from hearing the curse word, but still, why are you saying that at all to a 7-yr old?! So, I wasnt impressed with the demeanor and behavior of some patrons in the family areas.I stayed in a studio room: it was very clean and modern. The little patio was cute too- although I never had time to use it. The bathroom was big! The couch was a bit odd.Maintenance was very quick to respond and help, late night, when I was having repeated problems with my tv, which I greatly appreciated. I love that the rooms have a kitchen- they have everything, except an oven.  Stovetop, yes, but an oven, no. And I was missing icecube trays, which was a bit annoying, but easily got some when I ran into housekeeping.Regarding the time share facet- Yes, they want to find new timeshare prospects. However, it's pretty easy to step around this. Tripadvisor reviews suggest avoiding picking up the welcome package/gift- which I did. It was basically a bottle of water, so no loss there. And I unplugged the cord from the phone. Problem solved! They only left one message: I was not hounded at all. It was a non-issue.But the 'time share' element is part of the reason they dont clean everyday: it isnt a standard hotel. They come once, mid-stay and they tell you that upfront, upon check-in. It's not a surprise.Complimentary internet in the lobby, available all night. Complimentary coffee also, but I did not partake and a whole calendar of activities to participate in for kids and adults- many charge an additional fee.Cell phone signal isnt great in Sedona, but that's par for the course.I enjoyed my stay and wish I'd had more day time to explore the grounds and hit all the pools. My only two real gripes: 1st- that check out is 10am and non-negotiable w/o a late charge. 2nd- that they close the pools at 10pm. I'm glad it made things quiet, but there just arent any other lounge chairs to sit, or lie, on. (They are all locked up in the pool areas.) I wish they had some lounges or relaxation areas (in addition to bbq areas), where I could recline at night and stargaze, watch for meteors, etc.  I would stay here again if I was looking for an affordable place, just outside the heart of the town. Definitely!  ...and if I was rolling in some bucks and splurging, I would stay at the Enchantment Resort near Boynton Canyon! You can stay at the pool area all night there and it's very dark! :)Dont forget to visit the 4 vortex's. Detailed walking trail/vortex maps available at a local new age store, just a few miles down the road from the Sedona Summit.My girlfriends and I stayed here for a ladies get away weekend and mostly it was perfect.... great location, easy access, clean rooms and fun pools.  The staff was friendly but there were a few things that could be improved easily to make a good experience great... Don't add in 11 fees to your cost.  Just add them in the quote that you give at the beginning, I left feeling nickel and dimed instead of happy with my stay with you.  We were threatened with all kinds of other fees that could be applied if we did not follow the instructions.  We are married women in our thirties... not singles looking for Vegas that got lost in Sedona.  Treat your customers with some respect.  If you are going to market this as a VRBO, you need to leave more that the worlds smallest salt and pepper shaker and one load of laundry detergent and ONE extra roll of toilet paper.  We were not sure how to use the great kitchen with so little to cook with.  The whole point of paying more than hotel prices is to get more than a hotel offers, so step up your home-away from away game and stock your kitchens with at least the bare necessities.If you're looking for a room with no view, thin walls, a 10am checkout, a surly front desk staff, and animals making scratching noises in the AC, then Sedona Summit Resort is the place for you! But really, we made a priceline reservation, paying nearly full price. We stayed on a Wednesday (midweek, so not so busy, right...right?) checked in around 4pm, and were promptly met with a front desk clerk who seemed to loathe her job/life/generally everything.. Super! We get to our room, and hey, it's nice. Definitely not $120-nice, but I digress- the view out of our room is of the lovely maintenance garage/staff on their smoke breaks/golf carts full of laundry/the units across the way. Cool. We go back to the front desk and politely ask if we may have a room with something of a view. Surly girl informs us that there are no rooms with a view left, you get what you get and you don't throw a fit! Well, I'll admit she didn't really say that last part, but it felt that way. Ha. Ok. So we decide whatevs, yo- we'll make the most of it. The room, upon first trial seemed at least quiet. Right? Wrong! Swiss Family Robinson is staying next door (in one of the rooms with a view, no less), they arrived/stomped/cartwheeled/cirque du soleil-ed with nary a care for the noise that traveled through those incredibly thin walls. Sweet. Fast forward to bedtime. Swiss Family has ceased making noise, we turn on the fan for air movement, and it has some sort of issue causing it to creak and groan. Yay! In the morning, we call for a late-check out. Most hotels I've stayed at allow this, and alllow about a noon or 1pm check out.  No problem, right? Not here! Your late check out is 11am! Because ""normal"" checkout time is 10am and there is ""Someone waiting for your room."" And the piece de resistance? In the morning, we heard a small animal of some sort through the AC vent. Must have been a lizard or small rodent. As we got into our car and prepared to leave, several staff members appeared and walked towards our building carrying what appeared to be some sort of extermination-equipment. Bottom line? Next time we'll skip it.Me and my fiancee enjoyed our 7 night stay here. The check in process was extremely slow after our 2 hour commute from Scottsdale even though it was VIP. We declined the timeshare presentation and the concierge never asked again which was nice. Our studio view wasn't too great but that's no biggie, we took a walk every night around the neighborhood and saw greats views of the red rocks. Jacuzzi was nice at night. Only bummer is sedona is a sleepy town at night lacking nightlife for us twenty something's. But I would stay here again, clean and a beautiful resort that I got a great timeshare deal on.The staff was very friendly and helpful during check in.  The concierge desk gives you a welcome package with a map and postcards and gives suggestions of places to go, activities to participate in, and great restaurants.  However, they will try to sell you a sales pitch to purchase a timeshare but the lady concierge was very friendly.  The Studio Mesa room was a very nice and comfortable size.  Actually, very spacious.  There's a small dining area to eat.  Separate seating area with coffee table.  The bed is a full size bed so it wouldn't be very comfortable for couples.  The couch was a bit worn on the armrests.  The suite has a Sharp flat screen TV with DVD player and large sized refrigerator with dishwasher.  The shower was very large.  The bathroom is huge.  The entire suite was very clear and appliances and fixtures looked very new and modern.They offer a fair amount of activities on the premises.  Resort includes jacuzzis, pools, and laundry.I wasn't able to get any cellphone reception from my room.  There's ample parking for the different buildings.  Lights in the parking lot gives some security at night.  WiFi is available at a charge through AT&amp;T.","Love the layout of the 1 bedroom we stayed at.  Having kids in the living room on their comfortable sofa bed, they had such a ball.  And it's so nice to have our own space away while kids enjoyed themselves.  I loved to use their huge pool with the water falls and their jacuzzi every night.  Check in and check out was very easy and they were  so pleasant and accommodating.  I would definitely stay here again.Our unit is a studio unit. Just the two of us so there really is enough room. But I would have preferred the bed in a separate room. But since we went thru RCI, this is all they give. Checking in was good. Even let us check in a little early. We did attend a breakfast to listen to the timeshare talk. Our gentleman shared with us some things we didn't know. Which was good. Then a sales rep got us. A lovely young lady. Not pushy at all. We were very pleased with that. Then she gave us to another man. He was pleasant but insistent.  Then he brought another man.....long story short.  We were able to leave finally without my husband being furious.The first night we were here, no telephone service &amp; only 3 channels on TV. None that I wanted to watch. We called the front desk on our cell, they assured repair man would come. Late next morning I went to the front, again they would send someone .  Finally we say an employee in the parking lot &amp; he said he'd take a look.    He fixed our issues.Bed is comfy, bathroom a nice size. Kitchen for a studio is adequate . Accommodations are great. Wouldn't stay here again just because of the sales force.We booked a two bedroom through RCI and was pleasantly surprised to vacation at such a nice property. A little hard to find, since their are no signs to the resort and a very small sign for check-in. We read the other reviews about the timeshare volchers at check-in, so we avoided the concierge desk and phone calls our entire stay. The two bedroom was gorgeous. We were upgraded at check in and thoroughly enjoyed our accommodations. We would stay here again and recommend to a friend. The pack and play was a nice touch for my infant.This organization has no idea what customer service means.  The ""concierge"" is a joke and she gets bitchy if you try to avoid the timeshare sales pitch. She literally chased me out of the building to try to get me to talk to her about going to the sales pitch.If you stay here, tell them you are interested in buying- you might get a better room and a good view.I asked if we could check in a couple of hours early. Sure, but your room is not ready.  So the answer is no? We'll call you when it's ready; they didn't.  Housekeeping came one day but did not clean the shower or take the old linens, one of which was on the floor! We met some really gloomy pissy people. There are many choices in Sedona and I will definitely choose someplace else next time.My family &amp; I have stayed here three times in the past few months. We've just discovered the beauty of Sedona and we love coming back which makes the 4-5 hour drive from Las Vegas an easy one. The three times we've stayed at The Summit has been pleasant &amp; unproblematic. The staff has always been friendly. The pools are heated. The rooms have been great! The layout for us is especially functional for my family. We had the 2 master bedroom suite separated by the kitchen/living room. The grand parents stayed in one master, we stayed in the other, and the kids stayed on the pullout couch in the living room. All 3 times we stayed on the bottom floor, so our room backed up to the green and desert landscape, which is beautiful. We will be going back next month for another several day stay.We purchased a Living Social deal for two free nights. We were able to redeem in March. Checked in late Friday and had no problems. We were prepared to turn down the hard sales pitch we heard so much about but they did not bug us at check in. Room was much nicer than expected. Big size, full kitchen, perfect for two for the weekend. Spa and pool was really nice. We did receive a call Saturday asking if we wanted to see the timeshare presentation. We respectfully declined and they didn't push. All in all it was a great weekend!  We drove up from Phoenix so had the car to drive into downtown Sedona. We gave it 3 stars for location - it's a bit off the main road and if you were anticipating walking you will be disappointed. A vehicle is needed to get around.We are time share owners with Diamond through another property. Diamond now owns this property. This is the classiest property we have visited in the history of our time share experiences. The quality of the interior decorations were superior to any other facilities I have enjoyed elsewhere. The room was also well maintained. I could not find one fault with it. It is a beautiful, contemporary accommodation. The property is located on the southern end of Sedona, about 15 minutes' drive north of Cottonwood. It seemed well kept, with killer views.Check in was fast for us, as we hit a quiet time. I can see how it gets really busy sometimes. This is a large property, so they handle a lot of checking in's and checking out's! The lobby offers a wonderful free coffee machine, complete with liquid cream and various sweeteners on the side. That is a generous perk. Amusing aside: the resort used to have an espresso machine, I hear, but the employees gave it such a work out that they had to abandon that perk. But it shows that the mangement really wants to give a good experience.We enjoyed the ""turn on the switch"" fake fireplace that delivered subtle heat and ambiance, without the mess or expense of firewood. Our room had a Jaccuzzi type tub and a separate tiled shower. It contained a full kitchen with extensive granite counters, oven and a sizeable refrigerator. Certain rooms also contain washers and dryers, including ours (yay!). It is very nice to have that option. The Summit even provides laundry soap. Thoughtful touch. This room had beautifully tiled floors, complete with inlaid multi-color designs, and carpet in the living room and bedroom.This property contains many pools; the one near us was heated nicely. It was quiet and peaceful in our room, despite the full occupancy. We used the fitness center, which you access through the guest laundry room (that fooled us for a few rounds of the building!).Their equipment is minimal but of excellent quality. (I think they use CYBEX brand here, and it worked well and covered most of the key body parts -- OK, I mean muscle groups).  They had two treadmills, and two ellipticals. I think there is a locker room to store belongings next to the fitness room. I didn't explore that. The resort offers some activities during the week. We did not take advantage of that as we had our own itinerary planned.TIP: Internet in Sedona is not the most powerful and speediest. Plan for that. This property offers internet at a charge, but don't count on using it for major graphics or video usage. The speed won't accommodate it very well. Our Verizon cell phone worked OK-reception was normally OK with a few snatches of phrases cutting out. TIP 2: If you walk up Navoti Dr. and turn right (away from the street light onto 89A), you will eventually encounter a hiking trail.  It's on your right, right near a dirt parking lot. This property sits on the edge of development, so it's a great location to find a quiet space. Bring your hiking shoes, hat, sunscreen and sense of adventure! Sedona has something for everyone.I'd give it a lower rating if I could, but let's see what you think:* Made reservations 10 months in advance* Called ahead a few weeks in advance to confirm a late arrival* Upon arrival, the room wasn't ready.  Waited around for over a half hour to check in.  While waiting, my wife politely asked if there was any chance to get a room with a view, the response was ""you're lucky to get a room at all"".  Seriously?  Who says that?* Was finally told ""good news and bad news, you can have a room but you need to move again the next day.""  Dragged our luggage up/down the stairs, got to the room, went in, and there are people sleeping in the room.  Nice.  * Dragged luggage back to car, drove back to desk area, to discover that Diamond International overbooks by 5% and there are no more rooms.  After another 30-45 minutes, we were told to go to a motel/resort called Poco Diablo across town for the night and come back tomorrow.  Finally got to bed after 4:00 am.  I should add that this was on our wedding anniversary - not quite what we had in mind.* Next day finally got checked in at Sedona Summit.  Called the general manager, Mario Gonzales.  He apologized and asked why I wasn't happy with Poco Diablo - wow.  I didn't swap out my Hawaii timeshare to hang out in a motel room.  He then sent up two $25 gift vouchers for a mediocre restaurant also on the other side of town (Steaks and Sticks).  Upon reiterating my displeasure, Mario said he'd see what else he could do.  We never heard back although we did receive a gift basket with a small bag of doritos, six small oreos, and a DVD rental coupon worth $3.00.  Not only will I never go to Sedona Summit again, but I wouldn't consider any Diamond International resort.  Beyond the mishandling of this situation, the accommodations were simply average - nothing special.  The fitness center has but two ellipticals and two treadmills, the lobby is closed for renovations, and there's a bit of noise between rooms.  Also, they shut off the water to our timeshare for a few hours, though I suppose those things happen.  There is no restaurant within walking distance, and as others have mentioned, the cell coverage is spotty and the pay as you go internet service is terrible (over 1000ms ping latency when it works at all).  Don't go if you need to work.I will say that one bright spot is that the maintenance staff was friendly, quick with a wave and a smile as they putter around on their golf carts.  But that's about the best I can say for the place.  In short, you will do better elsewhere.We spoke with the manager, Michael Pena, and we discussed the issues which occurred on our visit. After we talked, he offered us a three day comp and promised our stay would be very different from our first. We'll have to wait 14 days for the certificate and then book our stay. We'll see what happens.Beautiful place - we had a two bedroom suite with a stunning view. Beds were super comfy, bathrooms were luxurious. We had no maid service because we were only there for four days - but hey! That's cool with me. Kitchen was very well stocked. Pool was great.Only four stars because you have to pay for Wi-fi, which I felt was a bunch of BS personally....only other part is it is part of a timeshare organization - I HATE timeshare presentations. BUT, the young man we had was actually pretty darn good - no hard sell. Just straight up told him I've got two in college and a mortgage payment - he backed off immediately. Just showed us the property and pretty much just shot the breeze with us the rest of the time - HOWEVER, I don't think this is the norm. I think my husband and I just got lucky....it's a time share/hotel property. avoid the ""concierge"" they'll just try to pitch you on the time share. outside of a pay day loan or leasing a car, one of the dumbest financial decisions one can make.the rooms were nice. very clean. kitchenette in the studio was perfect. you have to request a cleaning if you stay less than three nights. would stay here again if the price was right.We had a week in January (2013) and would have loved to stay longer! We pre-paid a promotional 'deal' through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FSkyAuction.com&amp;s=f88cb464b05b3a9f72a8d746af71cfbd636863bde9df1e2a92dbbed118359e0a"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">SkyAuction.com</a> upgrading it to a one bedroom. That was a GREAT decision because we enjoyed a full kitchen and a stacked washer/dryer unit.Check in is 4 PM and there were LOTS of people flooding the desks. The desk clerks were very organized, processed us quickly and we were out of there in no time. When handed the key cards, I was told to 'join [name] so I could get in on the VIP card ' or something like that. Having read these YELP reviews helped me to know that that meant the presentation for their time share 'opportunity', so I politely said 'no thank you' and kept walking. There was a very short, friendly 'pursuit', but I just kept walking back to the car, and our vacation began from that moment forward.I'll tell you: these units are gorgeous. There is a LOT of room for two people (one in the bedroom, the other on the foldout couch...both very comfy), the bathroom was HUGE with hi-end tile designs, bubbling spa-tub, and a hammered copper sink...very nice. Great lighting, nice fans to keep it well aired, etc. Starter-set of complimentary shampoo/soap (bring a shower cap). All VERY clean.The kitchen had everything we needed (except, get this: a funnel, which I could have used more than once but just improvised): cookware, glass/dishes/bakeware, soft supplies (dish soap, paper towels, sponges). And VERY upscale appliances (Cuisinart everything). In fact, it was so complete that we decided to cook ALL our meals in the unit but for one dinner out, and that saved us a TON of money.Our cell phones didn't work in the unit, so we made sure to make our calls while out. TIP: give others your telephone and extension in the unit and they can call you with no charges applied. Internet? I got as far as seeing the warning that it wasn't a safe connection (from the unit) and stopped. Others say there is a fee...The combined loss of outside, easy communications rendered an isolation that is good for some and others not. I'd opt to have both as an option (for free) and go silent as I'd choose.Would I look into another visit with Sedona Summit? Absolutely. The staff was stellar and we were left alone to contact them if we needed them. We did twice for very minor things, and they responded IMMEDIATELY. We had GREAT service.If and when I am in the market for a time share, it's very likely that I'd look into Diamond Resorts first...just based on this 'introductory' visit.Very clean and great amenities. Service is very fast. Only problem is that the beds are very hard.Second time staying at the resort, we are Diamond owners &amp; absolutely love this place, the staff is very welcoming, and the location is perfect on the edge of town, mins to everything but the views of the red rock mesas are incredible. I highly recommend staying here whether its a couple or large family, this resort is made to accommodate your needs.After a week at this resort, I feel compelled to share that our room was truly ""jaw-dropping"".  I have never stayed in such an elegant, luxurious room even after years of corporate travel.  We stayed in a Sunset 2 bedroom Suite that had to be over 1200 sq. ft.  Everything was beautifully designed, maintained in like new condition and very clean.The staff responded to requests we made for minor things with lightening speed. In particular, I'd recognize Eli for demonstrating the kind of customer focused spirit a guest would hope for.  We spent about half our time at the resort and half our time away on day trips.  Plenty to do in Sedona.I would ""wish"" for free WiFi instead of the $30 per device, though Internet access is offered for free in the lobby.  It also would have been ideal to have a simple diner on the premises.  This is definitely a stay I hope to repeat!This place was better than good but not great.  We had no cell phone service in our room or on that side of town (AT&amp;T) and we would have had to pay for wifi but we already have uverse account.We were very happy when we arrived, but it went down hill fast. First they charge for internet that is so slow that it is almost useless. Took 3 days to fix the t.v. The employees and the service they provided was excellent. Here's the stopper. Don't go to the time share presentation. After 3 hours and 30 mins. with four sales people it was enough. I have been to many time share presentations and have never seen a harder sales group. They gang up on you and never let go. It was a night mare and ruin our view of Diamond resorts forever. We travel 8 weeks of the year and could not believe this was really happening. the people that give this resort 5 stars are owners that want you to go. They gave up and bought it and want you to join them to keep this place running. Maintenance fees are $1200 a year. Where could you stay for a week on just this fee?I was a little scared about booking this place after reading about the reviews on yelp, but luckily we didn't encounter any of the time-share or concierge problems. The only drawback of this place was the unit we stayed in was SUPER hard to find!!  Other than that, the place was awesome!!  We got the 1 bedroom room and we arrived to a clean &amp; well stocked place. Even the kitchen was well stocked, which gave us the option of staying in instead of fighting the crowd at the restaurants, a big plus for us since we had our newborn with us. The bed was super comfortable...even the pull out sofa bed was comfy.  Definitely a place we would consider staying at again.Had a bad experience here sadly. First trip to Arizona and we booked our stay here. First of all the office was very chaotic and we noticed many others complaining as well. When we finally got our keys after an hour of waiting....we walk into our room only to find out that it was currently someone else's room. Immediately we went back and told the office staff and wanted a refund because we didn't want the same to happen to us if we stayed their! Looked like the property would have been nice had it have been run better.I very much enjoyed my stay at this hotel/condo.  I am not a timeshare owner, but found a great deal online for a studio for $44/night and the room was WAY worth it! It had a giant bathroom, nice sized kitchen, bed with extra pillows and comfy couch! The property is HUGE so it was kind of hard to find the reception and our room after dark.  We managed to escape the timeshare sales by not going over to concierge to ""pick up a parking pass.""  We did notice that they left us a few messages to call them, and once even called at 10:30 at night (wtf?!) but we ignored it the whole time and were fine.The room was a great deal for what we paid and I would do it again if the opportunity came up!Things to note:- There is no housekeeping service unless you stay over 4 days.- You are expected to wash any dishes you mess (there IS a dishwasher in the room!)   - The fridge makes a little bit of noise, but its a white noise that you can sleep through. - Lots of extra towels and pillows and blankets.","['returned', 'week', 'summit', 'brother',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/southwest-inn-at-sedona-sedona,Southwest Inn At Sedona,4.0,$$,47,"My wife and I loved staying at this hotel. The Frank Ghery room was perfect. Comfortable, clean, affordable. We will be back.Not bad...This is a comfortable, well-situated hotel in Sedona. We booked this particular location because the price was right and it had decent reviews.The decor is a bit kitschy - the architecture mimics the pueblo-style and the interior decor reminds me of a Mexican restaurant - but the beds are comfortable and there are fireplaces inside the rooms. The actual ventilation system was pretty annoying - it was loud and would waver from cold to hot randomly, leaving us boiling hot or frozen solid throughout the night.The staff are really friendly and happy, which is a nice way to be welcomed. They did not have any local maps though; we were given a less-than-stellar copy machine copy of a map, which did the trick, I suppose, but wasn't super helpful as it was kind of blurry and did not show the smaller street names.The bathroom is tiny and my friend said it creeped her out (like the movie Psycho) but at least it was clean, which is honestly the most important part.Beyond disappointed!  We were literally left out in the cold...We were en route from Santa Fe, NM to Palm Springs, CA and decided to stay overnight in Sedona instead pushing through our 12 hours road trip.  We booked a room at Southwest Inn at Sedona via Hotel Tonight app because of the great discount and the property looked beautiful and comfortable from the pictures.We arrived around 11:30pm and there was a note on the lobby stating it was Closed... And if you have or need to make a reservation, to please call the phone number provided.  We called the phone number and the man that answered said he didn't see our reservation but to go ahead and take a room and he'll see us in the morning.  He went ahead and gave us a room number and advised us that there is a key under the doormat.  There was no key to be found and the lights were on inside as if it was already occupied.  We told the man and we double-checked.  He apologized and suggested we book a room at the hotel/motel across the street because there's no one in their lobby.  We couldn't believe what just happened and ended up booking another room at a different hotel.Just out of curiosity, we checked out Southwest Inn on Yelp and it shows they're open 24/7... False.The Southwest Inn is a quaint, one-of-a-kind place in a nice location with very good views of the gorgeous rock formations from most rooms. Service was good, the breakfast was good, and the place was clean and nice looking. Only problems we experienced we're minor ones: the little gas fireplace was not in good working order and the fire had to be manually ignited each time we wanted to use it, the ceiling fan switch didn't work so the fan was on full blast all the time, the chain inside the toilette tank broke at one point (making the toilette unflushable)  so we fixed it ourselves. The one thing that was a bit troublesome is that the office totally shuts down at 9pm, and the instructions are to call the number guests are given after hours and the owner will respond immediately. We tried that when the ceiling fan malfunctioned, and nobody returned our call. Next morning, the guy at the front desk assigned somebody to repair the fan and it was taken care of.None of the minor issues ruined our stay by any means, and we might even stay at the  Southwest Inn some other time. For one thing, the little imperfections we experienced kind of reminded us of the hundreds of privately owned Pensiones we stayed in while living in Europe, especially in Italy. Thanks to the Southwest Inn, we were reminded of our former life as tourists in Europe...which is certainly not a bad thing! Mike O - AtlantaI stayed there during the Memorial Day weekend.  Kenny was the front desk guy, and he was particularly helpful, professional, friendly, informative, personable.  My room was on the second floor with a view of the mountains.  I could sit on the balcony and marvel at the wonder of nature.  Ahh.   Such peace and quiet.  Too bad Sedona has not buried its telephone wires and poles.   Interfered with the view of the mountains.   The room has a gas fireplace.   A nice touch.  It would have been romantic if I had someone romantic with me.   Plenty of room for me to roam in the room.   King-size bed came with lovely duvets and shams.   Very plush and comfy.  Bathroom was clean and had plenty of counter space.  The price included breakfast, which was yummy.   Enjoyed sitting on the patio in the breakfast room as well.   An even better view of the mountains.   Would I stay there again?   Absolutely!!   I would say the only downside was it was hard to use the wi-fi cause I was at the end of the resort.  And when the gas fireplace initially came on, it made a loud banging sort of noise.   Rather startling at first.Stayed at the Amara twice and loved it however this place for the money was great. Very clean, close to the Boynton Canyon trails. I like it quiet at night, was nervous when I pulled up and saw Inn so close to 89. Ended up sleeping with the door open to enjoy the cool fresh air, road noise was minimal! Breakfast was great. Sorry Amara, love your place but I will come back to Southwest Inn!Stayed here after reading the reviews and wanting to stay in a pet friendly hotel with our small dog. We have been to Sedona several times before to relax and get away.  Well you can't do that at this place because it is right on the highway and the traffic is super loud all night long.Room size was nice however the fake fireplace is on the whole time via the pilot light and while there is a fridge the rooms do not have a microwave. Bed was comfortable and bathroom was a good size. Nice to have a balcony but it was right on the parking lot and street. So again very noisy !Breakfast was a joke- frozen food that you had warm up and horrible coffee. Signs all over the room letting you know you could purchase their coffee cups and robes. The place is very dated and needs maintenance . The light a over our room door outside never worked so we had a hard time getting our key in the door. They use a usb type key- who wants to carry that around  when you are hiking.Staff was friendly enough but we have had an overall better experience at other places including a great hampton inn down the street . Won't be back.Private patio and jetted tub were amazing! Very friendly and attentive staff! Received a welcome letter before my stay and a thank you letter afterwards(Including a discount coupon for a future visit to share with friends and family!) Loved the knowledge around must do ' s while in Sedona.  The staff here genuinely care if you enjoy your stay! Thank you Southwest Inn! You have a loyal guest every time we travel to Sedona!I needed to find a place to stay in Sedona and after reading a bunch of reviews on Yelp choose the SW Inn.   I stayed for 3 nights around X-mas time.The +'s+Room was tastefully decorated and spotless!  The fireplace was super a pleasant surprise and good feature during those cold winter nights.  +Shower gel and soap smelled great. +I paid $140 for a second floor unit which I thought was very reasonable.+Free wifi.+Staff was very friendly. A few -'s-Slightly more road noise than I would like.  I'm pretty anal about quiet tho. -I'm a big breakfast person (because I go on long hiking trips) and although SW Inn included one with my room... I ended up going elsewhere after my first morning.  The simple, free, continental affair was well presented and  fine for some.. but I'd rather pay a little extra and get eggs &amp; potatoes. Overall, I thought this was a really cute and reasonable place to stay.  Can't say i loved Sedona itself (not enough rural hiking for me) but if I do come back I'd stay here again.I had no idea what to expect when I booked my stay at Southwest Inn (the website needs a redo), but it was across the street from my intended destination (the Sedona Marathon) and the only reasonably priced hotel in Sedona that welcomed my labrador. But the amazing customer service, by the owner himself, when booking the room, was refreshing. He even tried to direct me to running resources in Sedona! Also, when I called for advice on local restaurants, the new concierge at the front desk was likewise extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Then when I got to my room, I was pleasantly greeted by the charming touches--a fireplace, a jetted tub in the room, beautiful white comforter, tasteful art, a microfiber face towel, flat-screen TV.It also turned out to be walkable to some restaurants and on the side of town I prefer to enjoy when in Sedona. The breakfast was better than what you find free at most chain hotels. My husband had what he reported was an amazing home-cooked vegetarian burrito, and I had the option of granola instead of the usual sugary cereals. The public rooms were cozy and charming as well. While I don't usually go for the rustic bed-and-breakfast, this turned out to be an amazing, cozy value, and one I definitely plan to patronize the next time I travel to Sedona.Others have more eloquently reviewed this place so I don't have a lot to add.  Great customer service, great vibe, great breakfast burrito.I reserved a spot here based on Yelp reviews and because I got a good deal on a room. At first, I was put off that the hotel was so far away from the main area, but it turns out it worked just perfectly. ""Inn"" is the correct term because it didn't feel like a hotel at all. It had a very bed and breakfast feel with rooms complete with a big bathroom, shower and also a jacuzzi tub, fireplace and a comfy bed. It even had a little semi-private porch area for our room. Also, the little things like bath salts for the tub, fluffy bathrobes and bottled water really make a difference to making a stay more comfortable and enjoyable. The rooms were clean and this may sound weird, but smelled great - like a spa almost.The breakfast area is up the stairs from the lobby with a great view and had options including Belgian waffles and breakfast burritos (which were really good). It was set up sort of cafe style, also with two computers off to the side for those wanting to check email or print off documents. They have a free concierge on-site, which we didn't have time to take advantage of, but they have plenty of brochures and magazines for visitors.There is plenty of parking and you can walk to a pizza place on the corner and a bar across the street for a drink. Sedona is a pretty area, wish we could've stayed longer. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with our stay here.They have got to be kidding! This would be a three star place if they advertised as what they are, but they try to make it sound like a ""boutique"" hotel or bed and breakfast. It is a nice motel, like best western or a large chain property.The fireplace was the type you flick the switch and gas comes up from behind fake logs.The spa tub was small and the jets did not hit my shoulders.The outdoor spa was slightly warmer than luke.The breakfast was horrid. The burritos they raved about online were frozen and you popped them into the microwave. Even the hardboiled eggs were frozen. I swear this to you.The bed was comfortable and things were clean. They did give some bath salts to add to the tub. That was a nice touch. But for the money, stay somewhere else.We stayed here April 2014-- SO AWESOME! We were not expecting how nice considering dogs were allowed-- but were surprised with nice CLEAN white down comforters, spacious bathroom w/ great lighting, huge jacuzzi in the bathroom &amp; cozy fire place. Morning breakfast was good, fresh &amp; clean!! 5-stars for a little Inn from me!!--(the biggest neat-nick &amp; hotel critic!) Would absolutely come back for a romantic get away with my sweetie &amp; pup!!Our stay was for mostly hiking and sight seeing so we knew we wanted a friendly and cozy place to recoup each day.  This was a great value at about $220 per night for a suite with a fireplace.  Separate sitting room with a master bedroom that had a balcony starring at the red rocks up by Devils Bridge!  Breakfast each morning was included but simple.  If you go for coffee, oatmeal and maybe a bagel or make your own Belgian waffle it rocks!!  Staff is friendly and can suggest many good hiking trails to get going.  And the pizza place on the corner has excellent pizza and craft brews within 100ft of your hotel door!!  Will stay again!!!My girlfriend and I stayed here as our first stop on a cross country road trip. We came at a very quiet time and were thrilled to have such nice accommodations. The bed was extremely comfortable and I really enjoyed having late night access to the jacuzzi. Prices are very reasonable for all the hotel provides.I look forward to returning to Sedona and will definitely stay here again.We stayed here in early November. It was a lovely place, with comfy terry robes and a complimentary breakfast. The people in the office are extremely nice, very congenial and so helpful. As a first time visitor to Sedona, I feel fortunate to have stayed in the comfortable room with a large bathroom with very nice soaps,wi-fi, and fireplace. the bed and bedding were very nice and comfortable. Nice to be on the second floor and enjoy the view.We spent two nights here. We picked out this place because of the reviews on Yelp and the price. It was cheaper than other hotels around the area. On our way there, we passed by the other hotels near the main st where all the stores were located. We were pretty disappointed that this inn was further away, and was actually regretting choosing a hotel that was further out. When we got to the inn, the guy at the counter was very nice and welcoming. Showed us places to go eat and visit and gave us recommendations. The usb-like key for the rooms were pretty cool too. Since we weren't expecting much out of the place, we were all pleasantly surprised at how clean and cozy the room was. The bathroom were stocked with travel size toiletries and also had a single coffee machine with coffee pods and tea. Little things like complimentary water bottles (2) and robes really gave us an impression that the inn really cares about the guests' experience. The linens were clean and the interior design of the room was unique and special. The breakfast has selections like waffles, toast, burritos, eggs, fruits, cereal, yogurt, fresh coffee, orange juice, etc. We thought it was only a tiny bit above average. Since its complimentary, we really can't complain. The pool and jacuzzi is pretty small, but its better than nothing. We were truly impressed with this place, but most of the credit needs to be given to the housekeeper for our room- Gabriella. There is nothing better than coming back to a clean well kept room after a long day of hiking. We usually stay at large chain 4-star hotels, but Sedona West Inn has the best housekeeping in my opinion. Even the breakfast area was well kept. The nice lady who takes care of the breakfast area always came out to check if the place was clean. I guess since this place is small, they can give better customer service to their guests. I really recommend getting the upper floor rooms because you get a view from the balcony. Even though they are facing the parking lot, if you look to the side, you can see view of the mountain. The bottom rooms have zero views.So why not a 5 star? This might not matter to some people, but here are my reasons:-Internet was somewhat slow. But it might be the normal speed for the area.-Lobby closes at 9 pm (which means no access to microwave after 9)-Air conditioner pretty loud-Small pool and Jacuzzi-Bathtub seemed hollow and creaked every time I moved my feet. -Not a walking distance to main shopping/dining area. (Wasn't a big deal after visiting the stores)-The view from the balcony wasn't impressive.Anyways, it's not really a big deal, I would give it a 4.5 if I can. This place will be the place to stay for all our family if we ever go back to Sedona. I would recommend them to anyone. Just go there without any expectations and get the second floor room. You will be pleasantly surprised!Awesome, arrived via other yelp reviews. They showed us the rooms they had available before we signed on. Once we got our upstairs suite at a discounted price they got reservations for us at a really nice local establishment and also told us where some amazing hikes were. The bed was super comfy, clean rooms, big bathrooms, fireplace in living room. They even left the jacuzzi open late for us only asking that we lock it up when done. For the price compared to other local establishments it can't be beat. Oh the continental breakfast in the morning was great too! Great views highly recommend!This was a seamlessly beautiful experience. I reserved online, and check in was smooth and easy. The lady at the check in even made sure that I read the agreement about no smoking before I signed the document (extra plus points to make sure I understand what I'm signing). I booked a two room suite (Hopi) which was simply HUGE for the price. The bathroom was also big, and was self contained (unlike in other suites I've been in), with two sinks (perfect for couples). The room was lovely. The gas fireplace was a definitely romantic. The bed was a king size, nice and soft with great linens (nice touch with the copper borders guys). It's a great building, and a great hotel. We only stayed one night, so didn't get to check out the spa or the pool, but they looked very clean. Keep on doing what you're doing guys!","My wife and I travel here often as we are building a home and we always stay here at the Inn. It is clean, comfortable, well maintained and the pool is nice as is the hot tub. The rooms have a small fireplace and jetted tub, as well. The room has free wifi at a decent speed. They offer a very nice complimentary breakfast which includes, self-made waffles, cereal, juice, milk, toast and a terrific breakfast burrito. It is located above the office and has a nice patio that you can enjoy the morning air. The front desk folks are always thoughtful, helpful and accommodating. What really makes this stand out for us, however, is the price. Check around and see. You will find that to get the same level of accommodations, you should plan to pay more....especially in Sedona. We love this little jewel!Hands down the most magical hotel stay I've ever had.  Southwest Inn at Sedona is a botique hotel, and after staying a night there, I understood what ""botique"" actually entails.  This is definitely not a chain hotel.  Southwest Inn at Sedona only has about 20 rooms, which equates to a higher level of guest service available to guests.  My boyfriend reserved our room ahead of time and the receptionist suggested a great restaurant for our anniversary.  She spent plenty of time recommending other local places for us to enjoy, like she actually cared about our vacation - how rare these days!On to the specifics.  First botique touch - the room key!  Had a great little boot key chain that I ended up buying for my own key chain afterwards.  So cute!  Ok ok, more substantial details.  You walk into the room - clean, smells good, fireplace in the corner, Native American music softly welcoming you, robes laid out on the bed.  I'm in love instantly!  Went out on the patio and loved the view of the mountains.  FYI, you can never have a bad view in Sedona unless it's completely obstructed.  I could barely wait to finish dinner later that evening because I was so excited to come back and relax in our room.  And that we did.  We turned on the fire place, put our robes on, had a few glasses of wine, and took in the peace and quiet.  The next morning, we woke up for the complimentary breakfast.  It was by no means an elaborate setup, but as far as I'm concerned, if there is a waffle maker I'm ok.  Had all the other basics like eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, plus breakfast burritos!  At this point, nothing could dissapoint us.  We got a nice little table on the outdoor patio and enjoyed ourselves.Other ""botique"" touches that I enjoyed: a nice woven blanket in the room &amp; a DVD player (most chain hotels force you rent $15 movies only - my bf and I watched a $1 Redbox after dinner).I know ""magical"" seems a little corny, but that's just what this experience was thanks to Southwest Inn at Sedona.  I'm not interested in trying any other hotel in Sedona.  I'm thankful that they helped make our anniversary so special and can't wait to go back!Super friendly service, clean spacious 2 room suites!This place had clean rooms and included breakfast. I had to say ceilings were a bit then so we heard our upstairs neighbors walking around. There was free WiFi in this location, but it didn't work very well. Overall we enjoyed our stay here.Disappointing stay after reading reviews. Yes the fireplace was nice with the snow falling but the room was only mediocre. Even though a small fridge was included there was no microwave. I haven't stayed in a room at even half the price in years that didn't include a microwave. It was absolutely the worst breakfast options I've had, cold cereal and waffles and stale bread. I asked to be upgraded as we were forced to stay in the area for a third night and was told there wasn't any other options. Amazing considering the parking lot was almost empty and the no vacancy light never came on. Will surely look elsewhere next trip to Sedona.I stayed here once before on a romantic weekend getaway, and had a great time. So when I planned this past weekend's jaunt, I had to say just one thing to convince my companion to stay here:""Best. Beds. EVER.""They have these incredibly soft mattresses that you just sink into - perfect after a long day driving and walking. There's a kiva fireplace in the room, and we sprang for a jacuzzi tub, too. (My companion tells me it's good.) The staff there are unfailingly friendly and helpful. I keep meaning to try the complimentary breakfast, but I keep going there with people who aren't particularly early risers.If you're staying in Sedona, this is a great place to stay.PRO:- Great value for the rate. Me and the lady just stayed for three weeknights for $79 nightly in a king room on the first floor. Gas fireplace, mini-fridge, iPod alarm clock, DVD player, flat screen tv- Very comfortable bed and blankets.- Great location at the west end of town on the 89A. Still close to many places, but just outside the heart of the crowds- Outstanding housekeeping - I couldn't believe how clean and organized the room was when we got back to it at the end of each day.- Average to above average free continental breakfast - Standard stuff- Three computers with internet available until 8pm above the lobbyCONS (mostly minor)- Pillows were way too thick for me - I winded up sleeping with no pillows by the third night. They're so thick, my neck rested at a 45* angle on them when I laid down- Wireless internet was not working in the room - I asked about when we checked in and she said it probably wouldn't work and it didn't. I got the feeling it was a normal issue and not much was done about it, but I could be wrong.- Well equipped rooms, but a microwave would be nice- The lights above the sink in the bathroom could be used as heat lamps. I could literally feel my scalp burning when I had the lights on.All in all we were very happy with this place and would return again if the rates are right.We stayed there last year for my birthday; and were really disappointed with the place. As someone noticed - the only good about this hotel thing was the room sizes. That's exactly right! Location is very remote from downtown Sedona, views are obstracted by the building and you have to literally fall out of the balcony to see the mountain view. Breakfast was pretty bad, cold hard boiled eggs, bread, and cereal. We wil pay a little more next time but will make sure to stay at a better placeThis is a lovely hotel with very helpful staff mmbers. I had a concern over a billing matter. The front dest was quick to try and help until it was resolved. I will recommend this place to anyone! I love the inroom fireplace also!Adorable place to stay in Sedona. Definitely not a resort type of place (more bed &amp; breakfasty), but totally darling. The folks that worked in the front were so incredibly nice and helpful. One night one of the girls even offered to drive this couple into town because the wait for a cab was over an hour. How is that for service? They serve breakfast in the mornings from 7-10 which includes homemade breakfast burritos, whole fruit, different cereals, fresh waffles, toast and oatmeal. In the afternoons they have iced tea and lemonade in the front office. The rooms aren't anything fancy, but they are clean and nicely appointed. Loved all the towels in the bathroom! The A/C may be just a wall unit, but it  rocks and gave us the best nights sleep. I'm sure the comfy bed helped, too. If you want a better view of the red rocks, snag a room on the 2nd floor otherwise your view will be of the parking lot. Hint:  If you have a 1st floor room and you want to chill out on your patio on a warm evening, turn off your A/C in the room and the patio will cool off a ton!  You'll see what I mean.Pool and hot tub close at 9pm, but if you're in there at that time they'll just give you the padlock and ask you to lock up when you're done. Nice! Also, they have towels already out there so you do not need to bring any from your room. Just a heads up: while it's on the main highway, it's not on actual Main Street where all the little shops are. This really is an adorable place!Best deal, best rooms, best place in Sedona!Wow, I rarely give five-stars but this little Inn deserves it for the wonderful three-day weekend we had there.  Based on yelp reviews, decent price and pictures my husband and I picked this hotel for our one year anniversary trip to Sedona.  We had such an fun, romantic weekend and much of the credit had to be given to the Southwest Inn whose attention to detail made all the difference.  For the price, it's a worthwhile pick.PROS:  1.  Seamless reservation process on line which included an automatic upgrade to an upstairs room with a view when we mentioned yelp in our reservations.  We arrived after hours and the person at the front desk called to let us know where to find our keys and let us know that we can check in the next day after breakfast.  Doesn't get much more easier than that.              2.  The people at the lobby were always nice and pleasant and that goes a long way.            3.  The rooms were cleaned and organized really well and smelled good whenever we came back to the room after it was cleaned.            4.  The breakfast had enough variety so that we weren't bored in the three days we were there and the burritos were a unique and delicious touch.  The women who took care of the breakfast area did a great job keeping everything clean and filled.             5.  Facilities and rooms had its own southwestern motif which created a pleasant atmosphere.  Our room had a fireplace which was easy to use and safe.  The a/c worked well and wasn't particularly noisy in my opinion.  They had neat alarm clocks that you could hook up your ipod to and had options for ambient noises. We enjoyed tea and dinner on our patio one of the nights taking in the view of the red rocks.  The jacuzzi was nice and there were towels provided in a container by the jacuzzi.  We didn't have a chance to try out the pool.  Loved their bath products-they smelled so good and the soaps had a scrub side which felt good on the skin.         6.  Cool memory card type key with a colorful boot key chain.  Robes were laid out and they had apple-cider in ice waiting for us with two wine glasses and a nice note for our anniversary.  All these small, special touches made us feel welcome and like we had picked the right place for our special trip.  A big, fat recommend.Nice bed, clean, great breakfast. Must try the breakfast burrito.I may be biased, since this is where I spent the best Valentine's Day I've ever had, but I really liked this place. I had been ""kidnapped"" by my boyfriend the day before Valentine's Day. I wasn't told where we were going or what to expect; just to pack enough things to make it through tomorrow. I liked the spontaneous attitude my boyfriend was having, aside from him telling me we were going ""camping."" Being under the impression we were going to be ""roughing it,"" I was really impressed when this was where we wound up. He tried to make it seem as though we just stopped in Sedona and this was the first place we stopped to stay, but I saw the printed receipt from the internet. Anyways, the hotel is cute! I loved that we had a fireplace and that the beds were comfortable. There was only one strange thing about the entire stay. As you opened the door to enter the room for the first time, a chanting/mood music was playing on the radio. We didn't mind it, just thought it a bit strange.We loved the fireplace- we're easy to please and thought the breakfast was fine for what it was. I know people say the balconies overlook a parking lot, but look past it! We had beautiful mountains all around us! The staff was friendly, the room was nice and clean, and the beds and bathrobes in the room were both super comfortable! And as an added bonus, I left the hotel an engaged woman. Yup, he proposed! Right there in the room.I'm happy to say that if my fiance and I are ever in the area, we'd love to go back and stay at this hotel! ; )We reserved a room here with the owner who was great. Our dealings with him and everyone there was second to none at any Sedona resort. The reservation was set for our honeymoon! We went up a week early to see the different resorts and what they had to offer. We were unable to see any actual rooms at any resort. Therefore; we had to base our decision purely on panoramic views and the outside aura of the resort. We did end up going to another resort because the other resort did have a view that we could not turn down.  However the other resort did not offer a fireplace in the room like Southwest Inn has. We will definitely consider Southwest in the future as the people there are fabulous!!We stayed here 4 nights and loved the place.  Great atmosphere, the room was nice and clean.  We opted for a simple room for my wife and daughter.  We weren't planning on spending a lot of time in the room.  The staff were very nice, the continental breakfast very good (love the waffles).  Would highly recommend.The best feature is the room size.  After first time there it was a treat having more space since we have hiking gear. But if you want a view, you better get an upstairs room. Last time they stuck us in the end unit-downstairs directly behind the pool. Seemed like we were in a dark cave about five feet from the gate of the pool everyone had to access through to get to the pool, therefore no privacy on our porch. The AC was extremely loud every time it kicked on. We love hiking Sedona &amp; have stayed here a number of times, but that experience made it our last. They would not let us change rooms.  Beds are comfortable but breakfast is just OK at best.I was in Phoenix for a business trip Thurs through Saturday and decided to spend Sunday hiking in Sedona. .  I stayed at the Southwest Inn for one night. As a previous review mentioned it's not a resort but is a step up from the creepy motels I try to avoid when traveling solo The room was large, the bed was very comfy, and I had a pretty good view of the rock formations from my second story room balcony.  The young man at the desk when I checked in was very helpful, he gave nice suggestions on where to hike.  There were also nice spots to grab a bite within walking distance.  The inn was very close to Boynton Canyon and Doe Mountain trails.  I wish I'd brought a mountain bike, I'm sure I could've ridden to both trails easily from the Inn. I didn't have time to get in the hot tub or pool but other guests seemed to be enjoying them.  My only complaint was the wifi.  It was painfully slow the night I was there, and I couldnt get my post-conference work done using their connection.  In spite of that I would definitely come back the next time I'm up in SedonaModern rooms, fast free wifi in-room, and great (free) breakfasts.  Middle of all of the action in town.This is a small inn full of charm and sincere hospitality. We stayed here for 2 days and found the room comfortable and the complimentary breakfast buffet filling and delicious. The host I believe is an East Coast transplant who has taken well to her new city. She recommended good restaurants and things to do. Highly recommend this inn!","This is the perfect compromise between a really expensive resort and a scary motel for cheap. The rooms were very nicely-sized, the beds were incredibly comfortable, and the bathrooms were lovely! You even get robes to lounge in, which I think always takes up a hotel experience up a happy notch. The pool and hot tub were also very accessible and uncrowded. We had it to ourselves. Even though the hotel is right in the city of sedona and there is some traffic, you can't hear any noise and it's close to tasty restaurants. The front desk staff are super nice and helpful; when I asked about a place to donate all my food that I had not eaten when camping, the clerk (named Brie, I believe) searched and called places for me and even mapped out how to get there. The best part is the hot buffet breakfast that's included - vegetarian friendly! Vegetable burritos, boiled eggs, toast, coffee, and a Belgian waffle maker. I enjoyed taking my time eating and reading the paper and drinking coffee. Food always raises the bar in my hotel experiences :-D I highly recommend this hotel!I stayed there over the Thanksgiving holiday and I was disappointed with the room and location . The ""Inn"" is situated right off of HWY 89 and far from the village of Sedona . It was noisy and had the feel of a Motel 8 but priced at Hotel rates. The jacuzzi is kept under lock and key and requires guests to ask for it to be unlocked . In addition our room was uncomfortably warm because the guests that were staying below us in another room had their heat on....we actually had to open our balcony door to regulate room temperature. The view of the rocks is only capable if you lean over the balcony rail. Next time I'm in Sedona I think I'll spend an extra $50 per night and get something with a lot more to offer for the money.Lovely hotel, with service more akin to a very good bed &amp; breakfast inn than anything I've come to expect of a place with more than a half dozen rooms. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary, and since winter is the off-season in Sedona and rates were low, we splurged on one of the Southwest Inn's suites with a king bed. The bedclothes were fluffy and oh-so-soft; the towels were rich and cottony; the toiletries were spa quality.The breakfast buffet was a surprise to me, a diabetic who normally finds little she can eat in hotel breakfast buffets. There were hardboiled eggs and tasty and healthy black bean breakfast burritos, as well as homemade Belgian waffles and other goodies for those with a sweet tooth. My husband was less thrilled; he's an unregenerate carnivore and the breakfast buffet had no meat. However, given the other sources of protein, I don't think most people would miss it.About the only weak point in our week's stay was the hotel's Internet service; it was poor and extremely slow. If you are a businessperson who needs the internet to work, best go elsewhere. However, this place isn't a business hotel -- it's definitely geared towards vacationing travelers. And Sedona is gorgeous, so you shouldn't be wasting all that time online anyway. ;-)Very nice, clean and well cared for. The room was nice sized with a gas fireplace that added heat and ambiance. The front office people were more than helpful and very responsive. The complimentary breakfast was wonderful-waffles, cereal, burritos, toast, yogurt-pretty much anything you would want. We left before 7am and were able to take breakfast back to our room the day before and keep it in the room's refrigerator. I would definitely stay there again.We stayed here a few days after Christmas and were surprised at how busy the town/area was. The folks at Southwest Inn were nice and accommodating. We had a first floor king with jacuzzi. We loved the Southwestern charm and decor of the room -- especially the in room fireplace! Our only disappointment was the broken wi-fi. The folks at the front desk did comp a DVD rental for us, though. All in all a comfortable and charming stay. We would definitely recommend.We are staying only one night in Sedona.  We didn't want to pay a huge amount at a resort.  Due to the rave reviews on Trip Adviser, we booked a night at the Southwest Inn at Sedona.  The rooms are huge, nicely appointed in southwestern style, and the staff is very friendly.  If I were ever to venture through Sedona again, I would stay here.Agreeable.  A few notches above standard budget hotels at a reasonable price.  Large, clean rooms with a jacuzzi bath and in-room fireplace.  A helpful concierge willing to make restaurant recommendations and call in reservations.  She seemed to have limited knowledge of easy hikes nearby, but for more serious hiking, do your own research.  The sign in front claims ""bed and breakfast featuring Belgian waffles"" --- really it's just a typical continental breakfast with DIY waffles.",,,"['wife', 'loved', 'staying', 'hotel', 'frank',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/l-auberge-de-sedona-sedona-2,L'Auberge De Sedona,4.0,$$$$,189,"#BlownAway #Refreshed #BlessedI know when using hashtags, you typically post them at the end of your post, but I'm starting off with those above as there is not a better way to describe how I felt after spending a weekend at L'Auberge.While we'd been on the property a handful of times before for lunch, this weekend was the first time I'd ever stayed overnight at this resort, and it was quite a special and extremely memorable experience.From the sincere and friendly service all around, gorgeous property and scenic views, five star meals, comfortable and spacious rooms (hello indoor and outdoor shower!), incredible amenities, serene spa, etc... there was not a detail that was overlooked.The talented Executive Chef Rochelle Daniel's passion for her craft shows in every plate she sends out from her spacious newly renovated kitchen.  We had an incredible 9 course wine-paired dinner on our first night there, which deserves a dedicated review to follow.  We also had a delicious room service lunch upon arrival, a delicious breakfast in the restaurant on Saturday, a bottle of wine and charcuterie creekside on Saturday evening, and the infamous Sunday Brunch on Sunday before we left to return to reality.  Our weekend at L'Auberge is one we'll remember and cherish for years to come... I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a get-away and I hope to do a repeat visit (or several if I'm really lucky) in the future as well.The staff at the restaurant was very kind, but they did not have any available seats for dinnerso we were excited to have a good experience in the bar; however our experience was awful.We have never had this kind of the worst service ever before.We wanted to get seats but servers were just busily walking around and pretended not to notice us.A few minutes later, we talked to one server and asked who can take care of us and finally took seats.For the next five minutes after we took our seats, nothing happened.The bar tenders who must have noticed us seating at the outside open bar never talked to us even though they served other people at the bar. We talked again if someone can take care of usand finally we got menu. Another five minutes passed but no one took care of us and we were so disappointed and left the bar. This hotel/restaurant/bar seems to offer wonderful experiences but actually they provided very RUDE, UNPLEASANT and UNPROFESSIONAL service. We were so disappointed about how this hotel trains their employees. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BAR.For weddings this location has breathtaking views of the mountains of Sedona for the ceremony site. Just a thought for the hotel event coordinator, but in warm weather it would be helpful to have a canopy of some sort or some sort of shaded structure so that the bride, groom, and bridal party don't melt! The reception site is also quite beautiful as you are bordering the creek that runs along the hotel. The food we had was nicely presented, and the short rib entree was flavorful and very tender. The cake was part of the wedding package and it was a stunning creation. The cake inside had a lovely dark chocolate mousse-like frosting with vanilla cake. The cake itself was slightly dry but overall enjoyable. It doesn't seem like there's any self-parking here, so it is all valet. The service is fairly speedy and efficient, and this service is included with your stay (i.e., no tips allowed for the valet per hotel rules). They also offer a shuttle service which is convenient as they can take you to various locations close to the hotel.The room itself is spacious, airy, and very luxurious. It's the first time I've seen a hotel room with an outdoor shower! I was here for a wedding as part of a bridal party so I can't say about the prices for a regular stay here (I'm sure they are quite expensive) but the experience here is one of a kind if you are staying in Sedona.Wow. The quality of service we received is arguably the best we've ever had. L'Auberge has the ticket. Quality of personal service from all aspects is what's memorable. It can make any less than luxury aesthetic a favorable event. So to enjoy this type of service at a 4+ star resort really solidified our luxury experience. The beds are comfortable, the grounds are dreamy, and the amenities are incomparable. We really enjoyed the stargazing opportunity and being so close to the downtown. Splurge! Go for it!Celebrated a milestone birthday here &amp; stayed for 3 nights. Everyone from bellhop to check-in clerk to housekeeping to shuttle drivers to spa personnel to restaurant staff made me feel like a queen. I was upgraded to a cabin overlooking Duck Beach. The room was spacious. Fireplace ready to spark a fire. Great in-room coffee. Fluffy bed &amp; pillows, turn-down service. Four newspapers delivered daily. Enjoyed room service for lunch. Superb. Treated myself to dinner creekside. Fine dining at its best. Facilities perfect. From massage to steam room to the pool &amp; hot tub. Even enjoyed yoga several times. This resort is a splurge and totally earned its reputation for grand service &amp; high quality. I've travelled extensively &amp; stayed at ooo-la-la places. This ranks among the very best. Should I ever win the lottery, I'd move in permanently. Well done, L'Auberge. Well done.Fantastic resort and location in Sedona. I would highly recommend staying creekside. Its absolutely perfect with a deck overlooking the creek. You can walk to the creek and just enjoy the nature.Its absolutely a great environment for relaxation. The only knock...is the rooms are a bit dated...kind of rustic..but it maybe  more of a style issue for me, in addition the pool is a bit underwhelming. I would go back here in a heartbeat, its absolutely one of my favorite places in AZ.We were disappointed in our overall stay.  The room regularly wasn't cleaned until 4p.  Our room was right by a service drive so we could not even enjoy our balcony because there was constant noise outside.  Several ""projects"" going on including repaving the walkway during a whole afternoon where you could not even get to the lobby without cement splashing on you.  I felt the bathroom was very small for this luxe hotel.  Only one sink &amp; very little counter room.The bed was comfy but they didn't even have black out shades??Some people were exceptionally nice (Chad, Joel, Beau, Joe, Laurie) but some were just not.  We did experience the spa &amp; restaurant.  Spa was really just ok.  I was hoping for more of a luxe spa experience.  The restaurant was really excellent.  The best upscale food we had in Sedona.  It is pricey though.For the price we paid &amp; the experience we were expecting, l'auberge did not meet our expectations and I wish we would have stayed elsewhere.  I would not recommend this hotel.  If we go back to Sedona, we will not be staying here.Stayed 3 nights in a cabin with our dog. One of the big draws to this place is dining outside by the creek. We were there when it rained most of the time so we dined indoors in the not-quite-finished dining room and in our room. Dinners were good. Burrata interesting but not again, lamb neck ravioli interesting but not again, corn and crab bisque good, filet was great, cheese cake good, apple galette OK.  Service gets a 10. Coffee and pastries good in the mornings. Eat by the creek any time you can.  Cabin 30 was good for us, especially the wood burning fireplace. Also suggest 29 and 31 as these three are a bit less expensive but you can hear the creek and the creek is easy to get to. Wifi worked great. Not a fancy place but well cared for, great service, good food, terrific location. Definite go back and recommend to friends.Very nice place to stay if you are in Sedona.   We stayed in the cottage and itwas very roomy and clean.  Enjoyed the walk along the Oak Creek.  Staff membersare very friendly and courteous.  My wife booked under her name and I don't knowhow much she paid but her parents from Japan definitely enjoyed their stay here.Unfortunately, for someone who has stayed in Sedona before,I preferred the hotel next door (Amara Resort) for couple of reasons.1. Long and steep climb up to 89A.  I don't think you can walk up.  [If you stay at Amara Resort, walk up to 89A is much do-able]2. Car has to be valet parked.  We were told that no tipping is allowed on the hotelproperty so we didn't tip but still it's a hassle to have someone go get yourcar.  [Amara Resort, they have self park option.]There is a restaurant on the premise and we tried to eat breakfastthere but the lady at the front was totally clueless and rude so we decided not to eatthere.LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  You're paying for the location which is right alongside a creek.  It's the most calm, fancy place I can think of.  We went for brunch which was a little hefty but it's all you can eat including a raw bar.  The other food items were ok but I wouldn't go for any of them.  There was one item on the dessert table that I loved.  I just can't say enough how awesome it is to just hang out by a creek and eat.  I will definitely be heading back!!Very nice resort! We stayed in a cottage. They are very clean, spacious and have a wood burning fireplace in the room. A very nice thing for a cool evening. A very spacious deck out our door. We can walk a few steps away to the creek.  The scenery here is beautiful! Lots of beautiful trees, flowers, jasmine growing up trees and walls of some cottages. I would definitely choose this place to stay again!We ate breakfast and dinner here also and both times it was very good!  At dinner my husband and I split the Caesar salad, the flat bread and each got a salmon dinner. We enjoyed it all so much, and we left very full. Well worth the money.I can't seem to get my mind off of you...Five-star hotel; Red Rocks for viewNow that I'm awayThinking 'bout our stayOne of the best places that we've ever stayed inBought a Travelzoo deal for four days and three nightsGot a detached cottage; what a delightPrivate shower outdoorsDual sinks; hardwood floorsJacuzzi tub, four-poster king-size bed, and soft fine linenLush trees surround you; hard to forgetIt's only been a short time back, and I still haven't gotten over you yet!A vacation's that's all I ever wantedA vacation's that's what I really neededA vacation spent with my precious loveI swam twice in their small salt-water poolAttended stargazing class that was real coolAt the creek we fed ducksIt was so hot; we were in luckBy the valet, they had ice cold bottled water for the takingHad a romantic dinner for two outside by the creekFor the tasting menu I dressed real sheikFree shuttle service to townFor about half-mile aroundHiked up to the vista to see the views breathtakingRed rocks surround you; hard to forgetIt's only been a short time back, and I still haven't gotten over you yet!A vacation's that's all I ever wantedA vacation's that's what I really neededA vacation spent with my precious loveWhere do I begin? First off, let me just say that I love the L'Auberge branding, it's so elegant, so simple, but so wonderful. When you hear the name, you just want to go and stay there! L'Auberge in french means ""the Inn"" but it's much more than that. This place is listed on the list of the top 100 places to stay in the world. I can see why, really I do. This place is also the top 3 places to stay at in Sedona based on TripAdvisor, again, I can see why. It's won many awards for it's service and beautiful surrounding, and again, I can see why. I've been wanting to stay at this place for several years and every year, I would shriek at the price. Finally, I was able to find a deal where I was able to get vouchers for my stay to test it out first before I come back and spend $400-600 a night at a place I thought I'd like, but end up feeling ok about it, that was what I was worried about. But now that I've stayed here with the vouchers, I would come back and pay full price, hands downs, no questions asked. The place is kind of hidden, it's goes down into a private narrow driveway and you'll miss it if you don't carefully look for the sign ""L'Auberge"". It's right in the center of town, but at the same time, it's so quiet and peaceful. There's a valet greeting you and you don't have to tip them because it's included in the resort fee so no need to fumble over your wallet to find change to tip the valet guys. The valet guy got my stuff out for me and walked me over to the concierge desk to check in. The check in lobby is small with cucumber water greeting you and beautiful furniture for you to sit in. They explain to you how the resort fee works, the internet, the restaurants, etc. Then you're to walk to your room with the bell boy and he gives you a tour of the fitness center, the salt water pool, the restaurant, etc. Walking under the flower trees made it feel like heaven. It also kept us cool the entire stay. Once we checked in to our gorgeous french style room, we immediately changed into our bathing suits and got in to the salt water pool. It's a small pool but it was so perfect. We decided to peruse the town afterwards for dinner and it was such a cute and quaint downtown area. I loved it and no rowdy morons to ruin it for the rest of us, very peaceful. Later that night, we went to the lobby to meet for the stargazing and the man who worked there knows his stuff, he even built the telescope himself. On top of that, we got to see a close up of the moon and even see Saturn, sooo clearly too! I had an amazing time! The common area has games and a fireplace for us to open some wine and play chess and scrabble. I thought it was wonderful! Lunch at the Oak creek restaurant was also really nice (see my review for that). Every morning, we got to feed the ducks and my daughter loved it so much, we had to drag her away from there so that she won't overfeed the ducks. They serve scones, pastries, coffee, and tea every morning in the lobby. We loved it and would take our plates to sit by the creek on the swing and enjoy the view. They do yoga stretches every morning and I heard wonderful things about their spa services, I'll have to come back for that. The first day we were there, we were offered ice right to our room and bottles of water, they had their waters every where to keep people hydrated. The amenities in the room was wonderful, even the shampoo and body wash was so nice and they refilled it for us everyday. When we wanted to go hiking, the concierge was very helpful and gave us maps and where to go. The valet guys had iced cold water bottles for us ready to go for hiking. When we forgot things in our car, the valet guys would take us in the golf cart up to our car and back so we didn't have to walk up ourselves. When it was time to check out, they put our suitcases on the golf cart and took us out to the lobby, riding in the golf cart, my daughter really enjoyed it. Customer service was spectacular. I will say that this is one of the best places I've ever stayed in and I will come back to enjoy it once again.Unbelievable customer service. Top notch from top to bottom. We were greeted by the valet who were all incredibly friendly and helpful (most notably Beau and Makoa). Alexandria was such a delight at Check-in. She was welcoming, polite and knowledgeable-fantastic at her job. Makoa escorted us to our room while explaining the property. Such a gentleman and sweet young man. He also drove us to Uptown shortly after check-in which is a service the resort offers to their guests free of charge. Also free of charge is the use of the spa facilities, resort activities  (boccee ball, star gazing, duck feeding etc.) and newspaper to name a few. The grounds are incredible! We had a Garden Cottage and got a great rate! We were steps from the creek where they have lounge chairs and bench swings. Nice in the morning or at night to enjoy the sounds of the creek. We took a blanket from our room one evening and just enjoyed the sounds of the tranquil creek. We ate Creekside twice for breakfast- a tad on the expensive side for breakfast but you can't beat the setting. We failed to make reservations for dinner beforehand (tried for a dinner reservation Thursday for a Saturday night dinner reservation and they were already booked up)so be sure to book WELL in advance(not needed for breakfast). We hit up some other local restaurants so all was not lost! The cottage was very spacious with a deck to sit out and relax on. I was a little disappointed that we didn't have an outdoor shower as I thought all of the cottages did- I didn't see anywhere where it specified which has them and which didn't. Didn't ruin my stay but it was a bummer. Turn down service was nice. Toiletries were all nice. If they didn't have something you needed I'm  sure they would have brought it for you. Keurig with a few K-cups but you could always ask for more. A little note, all but wait staff at the restaurant and spa service providers do NOT accept tips. Which is a bummer because they're all outstanding. I hope they compensate well because they all MAKE this resort. My husband and I needed a little getaway and I couldn't have put together a more perfect resort myself. Absolutely wonderful!Gorgeous views.  Excellent service.  Restaurant was delicious.If I can stay in this hotel forever, I really would. It has the best food, best service, best review, Best of everything. Don't get me wrong, these luxuries come with an expensive price tag + 20% gratuity + $15 parking fee. Trust me though - it is worth every penny of it. I will consider myself a regular in Sedona and this is definitely the best hotel to stay at if you can afford it.L'Auberge is La-Boushie La-fantastic La everything! Grand place to stay.  This is that desert mirage oasis but in real life.  It's built along a creek and the sounds from the running water, birds and the echoing Cicadas in the trees while star gazing made me feel like I was in a jungle book adventure. I love romantic places and this is romantic! I luv nature and art and L'Auberge must've known because everywhere I looked.  I was surrounded by nature and it boosted my creative urges to take pictures everywhere, paint and write. Thank you universe and Spirit I found a place to call home while in Sedona. L'Auberge de Sedona is well worth a visit.  Sit by the creek.  Reflect.  Set your intentions.  Breathe and let go.  Then get your yoga booty up and go eat at the restaurant. Indulge coz you've been meditating all day on autopilot not even noticing because you've been hypnotized by L'Auberge's enchantment :)This is the second straight year that we traveled to L'Auberge de Sedona on Valentine's weekend.  Once again, we could not have been more pleased with the accommodations, services, staff, and food at this top notch resort.  The cottage rooms have all been completely renovated and are truly amazing whether alongside Oak Creek or high up on the hillside with unobstructed views of the gorgeous Sedona landscape.  From the valet to the front desk to the waiters, every member of the hotel staff could not have been more professional, caring, and courteous.  The Sunday Brunch is truly memorable with a very diverse selection of the finest foods.  The quality of the massages provided in the spa are among the best we have ever received.  If peace and quiet are what you're seeking, you will find it at L'Auberge de Sedona.  We will be back again and again.  We offer our highest rating to this fabulous venue.This review is only for dining at L'Auberge as we did not stay at the hotel.Let me preface my review by saying we have dined here twice. The first time we came was for lunch and we were pleased enough to return again for dinner on another visit to Sedona. The ambiance and atmosphere of the creek side dining is incredible. It might just be one of the best settings for a meal, not just in Sedona, but anywhere in Arizona. That said, I feel compelled to warn anyone who might be lured in by the setting because I have never been as disappointed with the quality and value of a meal as I was when we again came for dinner.Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying for a good meal. The food was good but nowhere near as good as it should have been for what we paid. My wife and I each had the three course meal, which was the only option available on their fixed menu. Your first two courses were smaller portions and the third course was a more generous portion. I say that with complete sarcasm as my third course was only a meager 4 oz. portion.My meal consisted of a tiny piece of bacon wrapped Lapin (which was their fancy name for rabbit), a sort of Dungeness crab &amp; spinach salad which was followed by a 4oz filet mignon. The three courses combined were probably less than 10oz total of food. My wife was served the same crab salad followed by a clam chowder (which would be more appropriately called clam broth as there was practically no clam in it) followed by a Ricotta Tortellini. They only had a ""verbal"" children's menu where we ordered a salmon filet and chicken fingers for our children.Again, the food was decent but it certainly was well below par for what we would expect when our total bill for the above meals, two beers and two children's drinks was $280! Yes, that is TWO HUNDRED and EIGHTY DOLLARS!!! I have had fine dining experiences in some of the most expensive cities in this county: New York, San Francisco and abroad: London, Paris and I have never seen such a high dollar bill for such average food.If you try dining at L'Auberge, please do yourself a favor, look at the menu (and prices first)! Oh, I forgot to mention, when we made our reservation, we were also asked to provide our credit card as we would be charged $40 if we didn't show or if we decided not to eat there. So, don't make a reservation before you know what you're getting yourself into. You can't beat the setting but it's not enough to make up for how they gouge you for the barely above average meals.I really wasn't expecting to have this miserable of an experience at L'Auberge. I have stayed at numerous resorts over my lifetime, and I always dreamt of staying here!Cue the travelzoo email I received months ago advertising a decent rate for their cottages and lodge rooms. Maybe my first mistake was going through travelzoo, or maybe it was booking the $100 a night cheaper ""lodge room"" instead of a ""cottage"". Anyway...I receive numerous e mails in the weeks leading up to our stay- all very professional, reminding us of our stay, reaching out to see if we had any specific requests... etc. All of these e mails remind us of the 3pm check in time, but if we would like to request to check in earlier or later to let them know...So we show up at L'Auberge at 3:30pm. There we are greeted by a friendly 17 year old who starts going over our reservation, and we are told our room is not ready. And that it won't be ready for about 40 more minutes or so. However, they offer us free cocktails, which we take them up on, and proceed to the bar area. We sit outside, and we get a couple glasses of wine. I'm annoyed- but I'm on vacation so I'm trying my best to enjoy myself. 45 minutes later, the concierge stops by our table, mumbles something really quickly, hands me an envelope and quickly walks away. It's our room key and a map of the hotel. No explanation on how to find our room other than the map, we set out to find it ourselves. After getting lost, we make our way back to the lobby and ask one of the valets where to go. He kindly points us in the right direction. We walk through the beautiful, gorgeous, manicured cabins, past the spa, and up to a super creepy looking horror story murder lodge. We walk in- it's dead silent and super super creepy. There seems to be an area for a concierge, but no one is there. We find our room, open the door, and are knocked over by the fumes of 10,000 cans of fabreeze. After joking about how disgustingly dirty our room must have been previous to our check in, my boyfriend and I put our things down and start to look around. The room is gross. It's weird. It's cheap. I've stayed in nicer rooms at the La Quinta while on spring break in college. Oh well, we figure we bought a coupon, we're on vacation, let's make the best of it.Then we open the door to the patio. Our patio is directly over the staff service entrance to the murder lodge. We sat outside for probably half an hour before we couldn't stand the annoying golf carts, trucks, and obnoxious employees going in and out. Loudly talking, cursing, ugh. So we go back into the room, only to realize it's somehow even louder inside. After wondering what the  hell is going on, we open our front door, only to realize that there is some weird reception/conference going on in the middle of the lodge. This immediately made us feel super uncomfortable- like we were crashing some work retreat. So we decide to get outta this situation by throwing on our swimsuits, bathrobes, and heading to the pool. Unfortunately, since there apparently are no employees manning the lodge, we don't know where to exit other than walking through 100 people wearing suits, cocktail attire and name tags. In our robes. Yeah. So the pool area (here's a positive!!) is super cute, and we had the entire thing to ourselves. We hung out in the hot tub for a bit and it was really nice. After about an hour, we head back to the La Quinta- I mean- the lodge- and AGAIN have to walk through all these peeps rubbing elbows. Kill me. Things improve from here, as we changed and headed to the veranda bar for some delicious wine and burgers. Our server was really awesome, and it was so beautiful and relaxing. Then we sadly have to trudge back to the lodge :( where we just want to relax and drink some wine on our balcony since it's now late enough that the staff is no longer scream talking about breaking bad 10 feet away. We go out to the deck- the lightbulb is burned out. So instead of calling the concierge again (we called down numerous times with questions/complaints) we just went back inside to watch some movies on the tube. The awfulness doesn't end yet guys! I know, this is a long one. So it's about 8 o clock at this point, we've been running around wine tasting/hiking/swimming/trying not to get murdered all day, so we turn down our own bed since no one has show up at this point. An hour and a 1/2 later at 9:30(!!!) theres a knock at our door for turn down service- ummmm thanks for waking us up! Trying to fall back asleep- we notice the loudest banging/slamming sounds I have ever heard coming from a building. Over and over and over again. This went on until at least midnight, when we finally fell back asleep. I was so frustrated at this point I wanted to cry/check out and drive home. It does get better tho- we had an amazing brunch the next morning which is the only real reason for 2 *'s. We couldn't wait to check out after brunch and gtfo! Never again!! I'm so dissapointed.","I am absolutely in love with this hotel! It's just so lovely. The staff is super nice and go above and beyond. The rooms are cozy and luxurious and the grounds are green and lush. The restaurant on the creek is one of the most peaceful and beautiful locations I have ever seen. We will definitely be back!!Customer service reviewHey guys, we just left! My husband and I were staying on their sister property Orchard Inn which literally had the most breathtaking views but spent 99% of our time here. 1. Serious SHOUT OUT to a fella named Cody, he seemed to be the guy over seeing all the events of our wedding party. There was a wine and cheese social, wedding day, and a brunch. He was so professional, a wonderful gentleman, extremely helpful and everything turned out great! If there was a way to request him to over see your event- Do it!!2. Valet guys, SHOUT OUT to Beau- he drove us back and forth server all times on different days and he made our ride very enjoyable! He had great information about Sedona and fun facts about the mountains and the town. 3. Our Bar Tender, SHOUT OUT to Johnny- He was a busy guy! Thank you for pouring perfect drinks, keeping the flow of the bar steady and efficient. I would recommend Johnny to be the bartender for your special event!We had breakfast by the creek and it was absolutely beautiful and romantic! Everyone is so incredible and our experience overall was awesome. Especially on a holiday weekend a great team such as, Cody, Beau &amp; Johnny, is needed within an establishment such as L'auberge and they nailed it. We will return one dayThis resort is absolute perfection. This has become one of our favorite spots. The rooms are luxuriously appointed no matter if you stay in a lodge room or a creekside cottage. I absolutely love the outdoor showers and the spa tub. Every single person on staff is a complete professional. The complimentary yoga class was relaxing and the pool is quiet and relaxing. The food is phenomenal! The specialty cocktails are fantastic and always changing. Bottom line: this place will cater to your every need and tailor an experience that is suited to the kind of vacation you want to have.Came here for my bday and this place has amazing baby kale salad and their Lauberge burger with fries is so good! Don't forget that their tables are outside next to Oak Creek with amazing views to the creek and a nice relaxing sound of running water!What a great hotel.  The ambiance is beautiful.  It's set on Oak Creek and has cottages along the creek and lodges set further back.  I must say that it's breathtaking.  The dining service is first rate.  We had breakfast near the very wide creek which provided the soothing water fountain sound that one needs when you have a toddler with you.  The hotel also had duck food so that kids could feed the ducks wading in the creek while waiting for their meals.Although it was pricey, the food was excellent and well worth the $100 for a family of four -2 adults, a 12 year old and a 2 year old.  We walked the premises and decided to come back in the Fall for our anniversary sans the kiddos.Upon retrieval of our car, our tip was declined. We were pleased to find out that when dining there, that valet is free and that employees at the hotel do not accept tips.  Wow. We will definitely be back.The Sunday brunch is definitely a bit pricy and the food is not too bad.  If you're looking for pretty good food at a higher price with some great scenery, this is your place.  Our waiter was very nice.Oh and if you want to eat here you will have to make reservations or you'll be sitting in the back.Husband brought me here after our winter holiday in Park City Utah, and I fell in love. We came back again for my bday and I commented ""if we ever got married, this would be the place"".  Well it was, and I am so at peace when we are fortunate to get away from the valley and spend some here.  The staff is amazing and the accommodations and grounds are wonderful...nothing comes close other than Sedona's red rocks.We stayed at L'auberge for a girls get away weekend. We had one of the cottages. Beautiful property, right on Oak Creek. (I believe it's Oak) I can't stress enough how gorgeous this property is. I actually brought my dog as well. When we checked into our cottage there was a knock on the door, and we were greeted by someone with a dog bed, dog toys, and hand made baked treats from the doggie bakery in town. Great touch for an animal friendly resort! We enjoyed a meditation class, and a yoga class. When you check in they will give you a schedule of complimentary classes....they are great! Every morning I took my dog for a walk down by the creek. So beautiful with the sound of the water, the ducks, and beautiful foliage. I would stop in and get my complimentary green tea, and that's how I started every day during my stay. Peaceful.We had lunch and a dinner at the restaurant. It was very good. If you do the brunch buffet, get there early as they do take their time bringing out items that are empty. The pool was beautiful. They did however only have four lounge chairs. We called and they said that's all they have, so we had to put our towels on the concrete pool deck...BUT a few minutes later a man came in with two more. Perfect! The concierge was VERY helpful with mapping out our tours of the vortexes. Also, if you need to go anywhere in town the Valet can take you in the resorts suv. (We had a few wine runs, lol) Great resort. We will be back next year.From dropping the car off at the valet to check in at the lobby all the way through checkout this hotel was great. The service could not be beat. Valet was quick with service and helpful with recommendations. Lobby staff was warm and welcoming. I took a yoga class which was lovely and personalized. The spa was beautiful and services were good. We ate twice at L'auberge restaurant right by the creek. Scenery was beautiful with water running and ducks swimming by. Lunch and dinner were both very good with great service again. The grounds of the hotel actually feel like you're in a fairytale with ponds and flowers and cottages. Valet was also very accommodating in giving us a ride wherever we wanted to go in town. Overall an excellent 5star hotel!All the great reviews pretty much sum it up.  The thing that sets them above the rest is their excellent customer service. No matter who it is or what you need, they do it without hesitation.A definite must is to go down to the river and just enjoy the beauty of it no matter if it's winter or summer. If you can spring it, get a cottage. Some of them have an outdoor shower which is really refreshing. Courtesy car takes you to nearby stops so no need to find parking or being the designated driver. L'Auberge is a getaway in itself. Highly recommend.We had such a wonderful experience here. We stayed in the spa cottage, the out door cedar shower was amazing and the room was beautiful! Breakfast and dinner at their restaurant was delicious! We spent the afternoon at their spa too! The facial I had was the best I've ever had at any spa! I can't wait for our next visit, we want to try a different cottage along the creek next! We highly recommend this place for a romantic get away!What an amazing experience. Customer service, food, ambiance and amenities are all 5-star.  I came for a relaxing get-away with friends and can't wait to return again.  The cottages are very private. We had the best time sitting by the creek talking, sipping wine and eating the best homemade hummus I've ever tasted.The positives: Great setting. Very quiet, well manicured lawns, and exceptional food. We never had a bad meal at the restaurant. Heated pool was very nice and not busy (even though we were there during a busy season).The negatives: Valet parking only. I was with a bunch of kids and needed to frequent my car for left over items and found the valet annoying and cumbersome.  Apparently you can park your car yourself if you sign a waiver which seems pretty funny. The rooms, while clean and equipped with the best pillows i've ever slept on,  definitely need an update at this price point! The hotel is non-tipping, but the multiple types of fees assessed on my reservation were difficult to keep track of. My email confirmation from the hotel didn't even have a break down of my stay with the fees, and when I called it took ten minutes for them to figure out.This was a wonderful experience. Arrived on a cold rainy night. The staff was warming and wonderful. All levels of staffing were extraordinary. The facilities were up to par but it was the service that make this place. Great job. Can't wait to go back.Absolutely amazing staff! Helpful and very pleasant. Very small but sometimes it's nice to have the intimate experience.The setting is lovely and the people are very nice, albeit something always seemed slightly off. Now granted, we grew up in NY and Ct. so perhaps we're just not used to the the south west vibe. I have nothing against, in fact all for, a laid back relaxing feeling. However in order for it to APPEAR that way to guests it has to be anything BUT that behind the scences. A craftily constructed management style done right will go far to make all appear easy and casual from the outside without belying the work that makes it happen.For example, there are muffins and coffee in the lobby every morning for a few hours for those who are not interested in a full breakfast.  The first morning there were no small plates or napkins for the muffins. The hostess who normally stands at the podium to the restaurant wasn't there so I mentioned it to one of the servers. He said he would bring some right out. He didn't, but eventually the hostess did. OK, a small annoyance but certainly something understandable. The next two mornings every time we arrived for coffee, there was none. When I went to pour the coffee, it was empty. I turned to the hostess and she said, ""oh...empty?"" It shouldn't have to be brought to her attention that the coffee is gone. Her podium is directly across from the bar where the coffee and tea is set up. Common sense would dictate that part of her job is check the coffee and when she sees it is getting low have that second one ready to go. You don't wait until a guest informs you and then be told that they're starting to brew a second one! Come on, even a Travelodge on the highway has it figured out. Day 2, same thing. People were starting to get impatient. We were heading out on a hike and  finally just left. And what's with the 2 tiny individual jelly jars that were always left out there practically empty? Either place a big bowl of little jars out there or some bowls of jelly.  Not rocket science,On our last night we ate dinner on the porch off the regular menu. We had the steak sandwich and pastrami sandwich, both with fries. The meal was very tasty and we really enjoyed it. The server could not have been more sweet. Now comes the example of bad organization. I asked her for salt and pepper. Poor girl did not know where to find them! After probably 7 minutes I asked another server if perhaps he could remind her. He promptly came back out with salt and pepper that he said he had taken from the bar and that she probably can't find them because they're always hidden. What??? It's a restaurant for God's sake. It's like going to a doctor's office and them never being able to find the blood pressure cuff. Come on...someone here needs to get on the ball. And if the chef feels that it is an insult to ask for salt and pepper..get over yourself. Two nice little salt and pepper cellars on the table would save you from the confusion.Someone needs to tighten things up there a little more for it to be the experience that it's certainly capable of.This place is heaven! Stayed in a cottage. The bathroom was huge! It had two different types of showers and also a jacuzzi tub.  I love this place!!!!  I wish I lived in that cottage.The staff is super nice too.The location right by the creek makes this property quite special. They run a type of a very formal service though, which can become odd at times. Upon arrival you are seated at a short of principal's office and have to be explained the rules and sign some paperwork. This vibe did not agree with me. I booked the vista suite for two nights, not sure it was worth it. It is huge, but with the exception of the bathroom which is majestic, is very sad and sparse decorated. The ""vista"" part is partly justified, you have a view to the rocks, yes. You are also on the first floor above the parking lot, with everything that this entails.  Their room dining was ok, the breakfast ( tried both buffet and a la carte) was very bad, albeit served in a very beautiful outside location right by the creek. If you have a dog you are not allowed to sit with the rest of the people there, but have to sit on a sad side patio, which as you have guessed is empty and unattended. At dinner time you have to book in advance a place at the beautiful creek patio- committing to a 4 course menu- or ...rightly guessed it is the outsiders patio for you again. Last order is at 9. After that nada. These kind of procedures make no sense to me and quite frankly turn the whole experience a bit sour. If you like flexible, uncomplicated service and like to plan your vacations on the go, probably not the right place.I loved this resort. L'Auberge is such a unique brand and I am so happy/fortunate to have stayed here at such a young age! First of all, the location of this hotel is very exclusive - it has a private driveway and is valet only. Since they (fortunately/unfortunately) charge a daily rate for your car, they record what room you are in. Which means no weirdos walking around. Since I would now consider myself a resident of Vegas, Arizona and Vegas have pretty similar weather patterns. I wouldn't be exaggerating saying that both of these places can push 100-110 degrees in the summer. when grabbing your car they always stock your car with water. If you're just passing by you can always grab a bottle as well. Tourists in Vegas on the strip are always spending endless amounts of money on water to avoid passing out from dehydration.Another thing I'd like to rave about is the spa...we visited the weekend right before it got super busy but it was just myself and my mother to use the steam room and spa area. In addition, they serve tea, an assortment of trail mix, fruity spa water, and an assortment of fresh fruits.I would say that the only downfall of this place is that it is a little dated. The bathrooms need a little upgrade and the living room furniture doesn't look that new. Additionally, they offer morning duck feedings by the creek at 8am daily. A nice little activity after getting some fresh coffee and scones. I know most hotels provide complimentary coffee in your room so it's just a little change of scenery to walk to the lobby which overlooks the creek. I also participated in the morning yoga which I thought was rather boring but thats just my opinion.I would definitely recommend this resort and Sedona because the town is so so beautiful.My fiancee and I have frequently stayed here at the L'auberge de Sedona many times over the last few years. We've always had a nice and relaxing time.  However on our most recent stay we've noticed a few things that definitely changed. We booked a winter/summer package promotion that they had where you stay in the winter and come back in the summer time on them. (Keep in mind, we've paid closet to $400 for the spa cottage) so by no means are we staying free on them. Before arriving they sent me an email to advise to call them with an expected arrival so that they can accommodate accordingly. So I did and requested to be checked in a little early. They said they will note it. The day of our arrival we got Brianna, she wasn't friendly at all. She saw that we were using the promo voucher, to put it simply she wasn't too accommodating. She said the room isn't ready yet (we arrived at 1:30 pm) I requested  1pm which was noted. She said we will put you on our priority check in, so we will call you when the room is ready. By the time 3:20pm rolled by no phone call, guaranteed check in is 3pm. So we went back to the reception area, I saw her and asked 'is the room ready yet?' She said  'let me check,' she went into the office for several minutes came out and I saw her walk to the little slot where the room keys were kept. She grabbed it and handed it to me. I looked at her and asked if the room had been ready all this time and she said 'no it was just now ready.' I know this was a lie.  We stayed in cottage #70, there were a few things that needed repair. The outdoor shower knob needed repair. One of the logs needed to be replaced. Overall the room itself was clean and immaculate. However I am not sure if the cottages are worth the price point that they are charging. On their high season the cottages are running close to $600. In the past I would haven given this place 4-5 stars but now I believe it's under new management it is lacking the world class customer service it is known for. I am not certain if we will be visiting again.","Hate to say but this place used to be great but is now resting on its laurels. In all fairness they are having a remodel but for what they charge there should not be any complaints. While service was still above average they seemed out of sorts and not up to their usual standards. Rooms did not get cleaned on time. Dinner was a small disaster, starting with a long wair for a reserved table, getting orders mixed up and food that was much too salty. Hopefully they will get it together before the season picks up.It's fine. As with many fine French restaurants, the technique is good, but flavor is not that strong. Most of the courses were disappointing for me. My wife fared a bit better.The foie gras course was a grand disappointment. Some kind of fried and thin sliced foie, like truffle thin. Didn't even have flavor. When you are expecting luscious foie, this is a huge letdown. The tortellini was nice, rabbit was nice, carpaccio was the best course. Service was fine but not elite. Both of us left nearly full servings of awful peas on our plates and staff didn't notice or ask if there was an issue. It makes for a fine romantic date. But at $360 after tip, it won't be a repeat performance.It is really hard for me to leave 2 stars at this place, because I don't like leaving bad reviews, and the staff and grounds of this place is amazing, but here is my reasoning why:$30/day gratuity is added to your room, which is nice because you don't have to keep pulling out $5 for valet, baggage, room service, etc. everyone is very helpful and very friendly!! The staff earned a star for being amazing at this place!We had dinner at L'Auberge, and then walked the grounds a bit. It was very romantic and peaceful! The grounds are beautiful! I love the little walks between the cottages to the river, and they also had a nice koi pond with a waterfall, and sitting areas by the creek. This earned another star.We wanted to go checkout the spa and pool, however because of a large wedding that was being held the same weekend it was swamped with drunk loud people, and it wouldn't have been the romantic weekend experience we were looking for, so we just headed back to the room for the remainder of the evening. Although it is not the hotels fault, this is where a star was lost because we couldn't use the pool or spa so a star was lost.We stayed in the lodge, and we were put on the first floor, with huge elephants on the second floor!! I don't know if it is an old hotel, or if the people above us were overly noisy, but we could hear every LOUD footstep they were making. We began wondering how many times they were going to walk back and forth and what they were doing up there!!! Around midnight, they went to bed, and so did we. However their footsteps woke us up in the morning and is what we heard while getting ready until we checked out. We also realized we never received the nightly turndown service, but didn't mention anything. This defiantly lost a star!! For the price of the rooms I would expect a much more peaceful experience!!! Also, in the morning, we opened our doors to the patio hoping to get some fresh air in the woods, but our room was facing a maintenance car, and all you could hear were maintenance workers rolling trashcans back and forth outside our room, not relaxing at all! They need to find a new place for their maintenance and storage area!!! Regrettably, another star was lost... :(I've been fortunate enough to have stayed at L'Auberge de Sedona twice and have loved every moment! I'm not sure where to begin with how wonderful this place is. First and foremost, the staff is incredibly friendly AND the rooms are amazing. Second, they allow (for an extra fee) furry family members to join their humans and also provide homemade dog treats from a local Sedona Barkery.  Because there are so many great things to say about L'Auberge, I'm going to summarize my comments by category below. ROOM- For both of our stays, we were in the cottages on the hill and the rooms are spacious with breathtaking views. It's such a treat to be able to wake up and take a shower outside (yes, there is an outdoor shower that is AMAZING) and/or to drink a cup of coffee on the balcony with the beautiful red rocks of Sedona. Note: each morning there were complimentary coffee and pastries in the lobby and they were DELICIOUS. :) WALKS/FITNESS ROOM/SPA- The grounds are beautiful and pet friendly. We walked our two boys several times throughout the day underneath the trees on the shaded walkway. Also, there is a grassy area that the boys seemed to really enjoy. The workout room consists of weights, two treadmills, and an elliptical. We were able to get in a good workout without any problems. The Spa is also really nice. We treated ourselves to a couple's massage, but honestly it was a bit pricey (then again, that's to be expected at a place like this). :) STAFF - The staff is amazing here. They are friendly and willing to quickly help with whatever you need. One thing we liked was the automatic gratuity charge which was nice for us because we didn't have to worry when we didn't have cash. :) Overall, I cannot wait till our next weekend getaway in Sedona. We will definitely be staying at L'Auberge again.ROOM 443 worst experience ever!!I wish we would have stayed somewhere else! I would not recommend this location/resort to anyone. It's sad because this trip to Sedona was our ""baby moon"" it was suppose to be relaxing and enjoyable. It was the least bit enjoyable.  I relaxed more Away from the resort then inside.Our first day here we checked in everyone was great, we located our room in the ""lodge"" area (worst location of the resort) I noticed right away the room was very small no view and our patio was directly across from the service area (loading trucks, workers etc in and out all day). The bathroom needed minor repairs, our shower nob was loose. The bathroom was so small theres about a foot of clearance from the shower to the toilet-being 8 months pregnant I was concern I was going to fall. (Honestly I think a 2star hotel has bigger bathrooms then what we had in our room) that afternoon we decided to go down to the creek where they have a sitting area. I asked for a menu to be brought down to us, the hostess said no problem she would bring someone right away ( they weren't busy at all) we waited 30 mins and still no one, so my husband goes up there to order another glass of wine and asks for menus again. 15 mins later still nothing. Finally I go to the front desk to ask for help. 10 mins go by and we finally get a menu..... That night as we head back to our room there was a wedding going on, i didn't think anything of it until we got back to our room and heard the noise even louder from our room, this went on till about 11pm. I would think that you would inform guests who are staying at the resort that there is events going on, especially if you're location right behind it...... I didn't get any sleep that night..The next day we were in and out, we come back to our room and much to our surprise our keys don't work.... The last day I just wanted to go home, I was so upset and emotional that we had spent over $1000 to stay here for 2 nights when we could have stayed at a $100 hotel with better service and experience then we received here. As we checked out the front desk asked me how was our stay, I got emotional and said we won't be returning or recommending this resort. (This next part is what got me to write this review) her response to my comment was shocking!  ""Well Mrs. Madsen if you don't tell us what we did wrong then we can't fix it, right?""  I thought to myself maybe a better way to phrase that is starting with I'm so sorry, and following up with is there something I can do.My wife and I stayed here last year and it was simply one of the best places we ever stayed in the US.Set apart from the busy Sedona experience, this tranquil respite offers peace of mind and body.  Spring for the cottage.  If you're going to do luxury, do it right or don't bother. Sorry for the late review  :) Don't miss Elote or a PInk Jeep tour!Went there a couple years back for anniversary. It was great, both the stay and the restaurant for dinner and breakfast. However, we've gone twice for lunch during day trips. I don't think I'll come for lunch again. The service is poor. Last time we were there for an hour and a half for lunch. Our server never actually stopped at our table. He would just take orders in passing, standing at the table corner positioned to move to another. He never stopped to ask how the food was, but just gave me the ""ok"" sign as he walked by once. Weird. Maybe they were understaffed? There was only one server I saw, though a ton of water servers and bus boys. My wife had the avocado and heirloom tomato sandwich. One of the tomato slices still had the sticker on it.UPDATE: The morning we were checking out, a gentleman struck up a conversation with me over the complimentary coffee and scones. When he asked how I enjoyed my stay, I asked if he worked for L'Auberge. He said yes, he was the general manager. I invited him to sit with us as we drank coffee and went point by pint through the resort's missteps. Still did not address our experience, but I was impressed with his genuine interest and how he owned that they had fallen short.For that and how he handled our situation, I upgrade my score. Here is my original review:One star. That's for the bed in the $300+ a night ""spa cottage.""You come to Sedona for the red rock views. There are no views here. Some of the other cottages get to see a creek. Maybe they paid more.  You can see pine tree-covered creeks in many places in America.Two days in a row, OUR view from our deck was the housekeeping staging area including piled up champaign buckets and room service refuse.We knew we were in trouble when we arrived and the valet boys were more interested in being boisterous than providing attentive and professional service.In fact, that is possibly the biggest complaint I have here: bad customer service. Everything is about the staff and what is convenient for them or what helps them look good.Service carts clambering down uneven sidewalks, past your bedside table at 8:30 a.m. ""Complimentary"" coffee and scones not replenished and not tended to. Calls regarding the aforementioned room service refuse being returned with ""You wanted to talk to us?"" No, we reported a slip in your service standard with hopes it would be addressed. Light bulbs out in the cottage. Deck chair faded from sun and filthy. Not-great food from the kitchen. A wacky gratuity policy that automatically charges tips to you room without being able to reward good service ... or penalize bad service.I could maybe ... MAYBE accept this standard if I were at a budget motel.It is inexcusable from a place that charges these rates and purports to be an exclusive enclave.We'll leave Sedona feeling taken. Don't repeat our experience.This experience has less to do with the hotel and more with the creek side dining. We traveled up with another couple this past weekend to celebrate my friend's wife birthday. We had heard of the creek side dining and amazing food experience of others but ours was not so memorable. Essentially I am sure the weather had a lot to do with it but the weather does not account for the bad food. 1st let me begin by saying all seating is outside (this is amazing if the weather permits). As we were waiting to have our order taken it began to lightly sprinkle. We were brought a large pool deck type umbrella that covered only 3 of us in our party (and we had to request another one), let me briefly mention that all the lighting is tied into the trees. So the umbrella blocks out literally ALL lighting and the only way to see is with the small candles at the tables (which there were only 2 of, and we had to ""request"" more as they were not offered). The candles eventually burnt out as we were waiting for our courses and we were subject to using the flashlights on our cell phones to actually see what we were eating. I will start and only mention my food and choices as the others at the tables had similar experiences. Course #1 36-Day Aged Beef Carpaccio -Cured Egg Yolk, Caviar, Pine-Fermented Garlic, House Rye Bread (a course which I did not finish I had about 2 bites of this before pushing it away as I could not handle the seasoning), This was ridiculously salty, My 1st bite of this caused me to cough and immediately reach for water to wash it down...a bit heavy handed on the salt for the 1st outing. Course #2-Smoked Lamb Neck Ravioli- Goat Cheese, Apricot, Maple Demi, all in all not a bad dish aside from the fact you are given 2 pieces of ravioli (mine was fine, while another party at our table complained of saltiness and not being able to take it down. #3 Creekstone All-Natural Filet Mignon *Pommes Puree, Red Wine Mushrooms, Sauce Bearnaise, served on a bed of potatoes...Dare I say it...Yes another overly salted dish. So of all 3 course we had I actually ate only 1, as well as a few others at the table. We dared not even attempt to take in dessert and went on our way. A few things to mention the menu states #1""Twenty Percent Gratuity will be Added to Parties of Six or More.""; there was only 4 oat our table and the tip was already included in our bill? #2 Please Refrain From the Use of Cell Phones in the Dining Room- We actually had no choice as this was the only light we could use to see our food, and when the waiter came by on the 1st occasion he said ""good idea, I've never seen someone use their phone like that"" and did not once try to resolve the issue. All in all a bad experience, I am sure the waiters didn't want to be running back and forth in the rain, let alone be in it period. We will most likely not return there. For the price in food we expected better, way better.There is nothing bad to say about the stay my boyfriend and I had at this resort.  Everyone was friendly and the service was exemplary.  The pictures online don't do the grounds justice. It's truly beautiful and relaxing.  I only wish we could have stayed longer!The location is fabulous and the restaurant down by the creek is beautiful.The rooms are very pleasant, but we wouldn't pitch it as a 5* - even though it is actually really nice :-)We were there for a wedding and had no hot water the morning of the wedding day, so had to traipse down to the spa for showers.... not what you expect of l'Auberge :-(The staff are super friendly and helpful and we definitely will come back as we like the location and loved the restaurant (especially breakfast down by the creek!) - it's by far the best place in Sedona in our humble opinion.We visited the Spa and were told we could wait at the pool, and order a cheese platter.  We ordered the platter, but half hour later, after no one showed up, we called.  ""Nathan"" apologized and told us that the platter will be there in ten minutes.  Twenty minutes later, nobody showed up.  We cancelled the order because we did not want massages on a full stomach.  But really, does it take 45 minutes to get us a cheese platter?  Apparently so!  Anyway, we were not the only ones complaining.  Other couples who ordered food were waiting as well.  Just so you know, their customer service is really bad!L'Auberge de Sedona goes above and beyond the write-ups and pictures online. The resort property is beautiful! Flowered walkways, waterfalls and a great seating area next to Oak Creek is only the beginning. The resort also has a great location; you can walk right up to the shops/restaurants or the friendly staff will drive you to and from where you would like to go.We stayed in a Spa Cottage, which was absolutely delightful. Upon arrival to our room, a personalized welcome letter and a box of chocolates greeted us. The room was gorgeous and had all high-end finishes, like the flat screen TV, gas fireplace, double sinks, jacuzzi tub, and outdoor shower. The pictures online and luxury amenities listed are all correct, but getting to enjoy them yourself, like stargazing on your private balcony in your comfy robe and slippers, really made the spa cottage experience your own. We had dinner at L'Auberge Restaurant and were seated right next to Oak Creek. The menu is fixed choices for a 3/4 course dinner and each dish was absolutely fabulous. For the main course I ordered the Creekstone All Natural Filet Mignon and it was to die for. They also had a very extensive wine list and great dessert choices.We had an overall exceptional experience at L'Auberge de Sedona.Serious royal treatment here... This is by far a 5 star resort and the best place we have ever stayed. We actually got an awesome three night stay deal from TravelZoo, and boy has it been well work it. We got to stay in the Spa cottage, which is AMAZING! It has a wonderful jet tub, a huge shower and even a private outdoor shower. The room is very modern and tranquil. They have slippers and robes ready for you. They even do a turn down service every night. It's so peaceful, located right along oak creek. I love the fact that they have a salt water pool and jacuzzi.... No need to worry about my blonde locks turning green :). The fitness room isn't too crazy... Just a couple of treadmills, an elliptical and a couple of benches and weights. Everyone has been so friendly and helpful. I had a wonderful facial from Amanda at the spa (the antioxidant facial is well worth it!) The Resort does charge a daily fee as well as parking fee, but it's not too bad as the fees cover gratuity for housekeeping, valet and the guy that helps you with your luggage (do they still call that a bell hop??) The only times you need to worry about tipping is at the spa, restaurant and bar. Words really can't describe how wonderful this experience has been, you will just have to come here and see for yourself...My husband surprised me with a trip to Sedona for four days/nights at L'Auberge for my 40th birthday. Pros: Absolutely gorgeous grounds that do not capitalize on the ""southwest"" look of so many other establishments - it is more of a rustic charm setting and I really enjoyed the ""feel"" of the place.  We stayed in Creekside cottage/suit #2 and the view off the huge deck of the creek and the mountains was stunning. They restock your mini fridge with complimentary bottled water which I appreciated. The staff are genuinely helpful and personable. We enjoyed many interactions with them. Other than restaurant and spa services, it is a ""no tipping"" establishment. In addition to valet, they offer a complimentary shuttle to many shops and restaurants. Cons:The mini fridge in our room had an odd smell to it. I found myself holding my breath every time I opened it. We also had to request an area of our room be cleaned three times; the spot between the headboard and the bottom mattress had quite a bit of dust and crumbs. We found it only because we were looking for a pair of misplaced socks. We initially left a note for housekeeping and then had to alert the front desk when it still wasn't cleaned. After housekeeping came again and it still wasn't attended to, we had to go to the front desk again. We stocked up on wine that we kept in our room, however, housekeeping continually left our dirty wine glasses behind.The Sunday brunch is very good and, with the mimosa, champagne, and Bloody Mary (plus refills) included, it is worth the $50+ per person price point. The service was also excellent - my only critique was that we noticed a ceramic plant holder on the floor that had a very thick ring of dust all around the base. It quite literally looked like it had never been cleaned. We pointed it out to our server who seemed to address it immediately. Daily, right on the path to our room, there would be a golf cart parked that we continually walked around. I appreciate that they need an ability to get around the grounds but it was nearly always there and the placement felt like an eyesore. In addition, as you walk by, the cart had trash and debris in it (paper, empty plastic bottles, etc.). Overall, I would return and it really is a beautiful property with polite, service-oriented staff. I wonder, however, if L'Auberge relies a bit too much on its scenic locale as I think greater attention to detail could be paid - especially for the price.My husband and I stay here annually. I can't say enough good things about this resort. Everything is perfect- the employees are genuinely friendly, professional, and accommodating. We stayed in the Vista Suites, which overlook the red rock mountains- an absolutely stunning view. We were upgraded due to it being our anniversary, and also given the cabin at the far end for extra privacy.They delivered a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, much to our surprise.The room is beautiful. Hardwood floors, separate living room with a fireplace. Sliding doors from the bedroom and living room that extend to a large outdoor patio. My favorite amenity is the bathroom.. Jacuzzi tub, walk in shower, and best yet- a beautiful, private, outdoor shower. We will continue to make this an annual getaway.This review is not of the hotel but of the service or lack of service at the restaurant. For a five star resort I would expect better service from their  staff.My best friends were  staying for a week at Hotel celebrating the New Year as well as a milestone birthdayI wanted to arrange for a bottle of champagne to be delivered to their table on New Year's Eve.It took me 3 attempts to accomplish  what I thought would be an easy feat.  I left messages for restaurant manager, concierge  and I  never received call back.  I had to persist in calling , Good thing I started calling 3 days in advance .I was finally able to arrange with the hostess t(Chelsea ) that I wanted a  $100 bottle of champagne  at the table at the time of the dinner reservation. NOT during but at their table as my friends arrived.Fortunately I had alerted my girlfriend's husband that there would be a bottle of champagne at their table. Well there WASN'T. .. He had to inquire with his server about the champagne, at which time the response was ""we're 'working on it"" . Okay I get it , it's New Years Eve it's busy. But to make matters worse, I had asked for a note to accompany champagne wishing her a ""Happy Birthday  Enjoy."" What she received looked like a 3rd grader wrote a note and instead of ""Enjoy "" it read ""Happy Birthday &amp; Joy."" Now it is, comical  but  I would be embarrassed if my staff could not execute such a simple task on time and with some degree of pride and elegance. Very disappointing I would expect more from  L'Auberge.It was our first time in Sedona and thought we'd stay in one of the best rated hotels in the area and L' Auberge did not disappoint. The place is classy without trying too hard. It sits by the Oak Creek and takes advantage of its natural beauty. It works with the environment, not trying to mold it. Feel free to wander around creekside, feed the ducks or just sit by the comfy chairs with a cup of hot coco/coffee in the morning listening to the waters flowing. It's almost poetic. The room we had was clean and spacious although the bathroom was a bit small, the door barely missing the toilet. The staff is friendly and engaging. From the valet to the concierge, the service was excellent. All in all, this place is awesome. We're definitely coming back.This place is absolute heaven. Luxury in Sedona at its finest. The staff are super helpful and attentive, and the grounds are absolutely beautifully kept. The dinner and breakfast were amazing. Very pricey for dinner however, but totally worth it if you are at a place like this. The only thing that really kept me from giving five stars was the room itself. We had something wrong with our air conditioner it seemed and it kept making this weird noise which made it difficult to sleep. Also the bathroom was suuuuper tiny, and you could just barely close the door without hitting the toilet seat (literally I don't think there was even a centimeter in between). I cannot remember what room we had, but I know it was one of the cheaper ones. Anywho, not a super big deal since we only stayed for one night, and we spent most of our time out biking and at the pool.Probably my favorite part was the pool. Absolutely beautiful. And no kids. Just adults, drinking, and peace and quiet. The trees and view surrounding the pool were gorgeous as well. We would definitely stay here again!I love this place we had a special weekend away from Vegas and this place made it even more special!  We arrive to the property and see an amazing view just from the valet area not even to our room yet.  The staff is very polite and kind and explain all the amenities and activities within their resort.  I was pleasantly surprised to find they had sunrise outdoor Yoga and with a view like this I have no problem getting up at 5am to do yoga!Ahh the room, beautiful... we had a private cabin on the top of the hill on their property overlooking the amazing valley a patio to sit and have wine or coffee.  The whole cabin had wood floors though out.  The living room had fire place with a couch and a TV, coffee maker, fridge and free wifi   (a huge plus in my book)   The bedroom a King size bed with down comforters and pillows a settee a walk in closet and a safe.  The bathroom oh the bathroom... huge double sink, whirlpool tub, private toilet and a closed in outdoor shower yes an outdoor shower.  The shower is completely enclosed and private but is open on the top.  Let me tell you whats it's like to take a hot shower at night looking up and the stars in Sedona, AMAZING! One of the activities I enjoyed was star gazing a local gentleman is a astronomer he had two large telescopes it is a class but so much fun to have him tell you what your looking at.  I had a clear view of saturn rings and all with his telescope.  He does this for free but I gave him a nice tip ($20) because I enjoyed his knowledge so much.  He gave me a picture of sedona night and stars that he took in return.  The other activity I really enjoyed was sunrise Yoga they have it on a patio over looking the valley the sun is coming up and the red rocks are beautiful I felt at peace like I haven't felt in a very long while.  You do your poses listening to birds chirp a light breeze blowing, oh I wish I could do this every morning...They made this an amazing experience I will be back in the future.","From the moment you pull in, being greated by the valet to take your car and them saying they do not accept tips, let's you know,  that this place is different from the rest.  A lot of our interaction with he staff was with the valet team because our plans included seeing different parts of Sedona and outside of Sedona.  Each time we spoke with them we received genuine reactions and suggestions of places they would recommend around town and their thoughts of places we were thinking about. This was extremely refreshing. When we were not traversing throughout Sedona and we were on property the view was second to none.  We later learned,  L'Auberge de Sedona is one of two resorts in the area that offer the type of landscape,  views and service we were experiencing. The property is tucked away from the main road,  where you almost miss it driving in to.  The resort is backed up to a creek and the trees provide the much needed shade we were thankful for during our stay in the beginning of August.  If you are looking for a quite,  secluded and serene place to stay in Sedona,  this is a tough spot to beat.If you can afford it, stay here!! We stayed in the villa suite and it did not disappoint. My favorite part of the room was the large window above the jacuzzi with the gorgeous view of the red rocks! Outdoor cedar shower was pretty nice too.Very nice creekside hotel and spa with great views of the famous red rocks.AMBIENCE:  5 stars.   Great location along the creek, beautifully maintained grounds with great trees.  We stayed in a spa room, which was pretty big, with king-size bed, fireplace, flat screen TV (which we used to watch the U of Az basketball team beat the U of Michigan!!), a bathroom that was literally bigger than my college dorm room--separate shower and soaking tub, and a really awesome OUTDOOR shower (fully enclosed on the sides for privacy, but open to the sky).  The hotel lobby is nice, and there is not a typical check-in area, there are several concierge-type desks where they serve you.  The restaurant is small but well-appointed and intimate, and there is a nice little bar with outside seating available as well.SERVICE:  4 stars--the vast majority of the staff I would give 5 stars to--the bartenders were great, the server we had in the restaurant was definitely in the top 5 servers I have ever had in my life, and the spa staff was top notch (from the folks who check you in to the people performing the services).  The valets deserve particular praise--very quick and polite, and happy to give advice on local attractions, bottled water, etc.My one quibble is we had checked in a bit early, so our concierge told us we could wait for a few minutes and he would get us the keys--no big problem.  We waited in the very comfortable lobby area (and wandered down to the creek), but he never came back to us, and I couldn't find him at his desk.  There was another concierge there, so I asked her and she seemed quite annoyed with the entire issue.  My wife and I tried to soften her up by getting her chatting about hikes, etc--but she was not having any of it and basically just handed us a map with a list of hiking trails (I wanted to say that they actually have this new thing called ""the internet"" that works almost anyplace and can get me the same information that she just gave me but faster and with much less attitude, but it was my anniversary so I let it slide)!They also have enrichment lectures that are free to go to, and my wife and I went to one with a past-life expert that was a little outside of my comfort zone but was very interesting to learn about.FOOD:  5 stars.  This restaurant is everything the other reviews say it is--amazing service, top rate food and wine selection, very comfortable dining room.  Great place for a romantic dinner.ALCOHOL:  5 stars.  The bar is small, but man, they have a GREAT selection.  My wife is a bourbon afficiando, and they had a bottle of 20-year old Pappy Van Winkle (they release a very small amount of these per year), and she was able to enjoy a glass of this and it is not an overestimate to say that it was life-changing (definitely NOT cheap, but how often do you have your 15th anniversary?!?).  I love their margaritas (fresh juice, agave nectar, etc)--and I think I had about six of them in the 3 days that we were there.SPA:  5 stars.  It is a small spa, but the service and services are amazing.  The front desk staff were helpful and seemed happy that we were there--we actually walked in there on our first day without reservations and they were able to get some stuff going for us that afternoon.  We had two sessions of couples massages, and they were both amazing.  VALUE:  Listen, this place is not inexpensive, but it is a beautiful hotel in an incredible location--really worth every penny we spent!  It is a great place for a romantic weekend, and a really good launching place to explore one of my favorite places on earth--Sedona!We went for a wedding and it was beautiful. The back drop for the vows was breath taking. The staff is super friendly and attentive and there before you could even think to ask for something. When we went to the reception we had a bartender, I think her name was Elizabeth, who was also great. She was fun, fast and friendly. The food was okay, the property is beautiful and we would definitely come stay her the next time we are in Sedona.I recently visited this hotel with my husband for our anniversary trip and it was a wonderful and magical experience. We stayed in a Red Rock view room and the view off the spacious balcony was breathtaking. The room itself was just perfect. Spacious and open with tall ceilings and a nice large bathroom - including an outdoor cedar shower, which my husband loved. Everyone from the valet attendants to front desk staff and restaurant servers were helpful, professional and attentive. The only negative part of my experience was the spa. I would not recommend going to this spa if you are looking for a luxurious spa experience. They have few amenities at all, and on the day I came, the steam room (which is all you get besides showers and a toilet) was broken. They knocked 30 bucks off my massage to apologize for the steam room problem (I had specifically asked about the steam room when I booked), but I still wonder why I'd spend $120 for a massage and no amenities??? I could have gone to a low budget spa and had essentially the same experience. So the lesson here: Spend 10 or 15 bucks more and go to Enchantment for your spa experience if you stay at L'Auberge. The other negative part of this experience, which everyone should know is the daily car parking charge of $15 plus the daily resort fee, which I think was around $35. This is supposed to cover tipping and Internet and the free rides around town they include for you, but an extra $50 a day is ridiculous no matter how you look at it. Since we came to visit with a Travelzoo voucher which made the rooms cheaper and included a resort credit, I didn't particularly mind the additional cost, but I do have to honestly say that if this resort would have been priced at its normal price point and then they would've gouged me with all of these fees, I would have been really disappointed. I think if you stay away from the spa and can visit this resort in the low season when the rates are reduced and you understand there will be fees, then I know you'll have a wonderful experience. It just oozes romance and the beautiful landscape and babbling creek are just so peaceful. It's a total zen place! Oh, and make sure to dine at the restaurant - it's magnificent! Truly world class!We've only stayed one night at L'Auberge, but had the most amazing experience. The hotel staff were very professional yet friendly. Just loved where the hotel was located. The best part was having breakfast at the hotel restaurant next to the creek. It was the most relaxing moment. The property is pretty and well maintained. I would love to stay there again!This is a gem of a resort in Sedona, AZ. My husband brought me here for a birthday surprise and it is absolutely delightful. This is a gorgeous property on the bankside of Oak Creek. Every morning of our stay we walked down to Oak Creek to feed the ducks, watch squirrels climb trees, and spot other wildlife who decide to make a magical appearance. The cottages are light and clean, and have a fireplace, spa tub, indoor shower, and an outdoor shower as well. It's a thrill taking a hot shower in 27 degree weather with the sky, sun, stars and trees overhead...loved it! The restaurant on-site is elegant and the food is scrumptious...the salmon, filet mignon, pommes, venison, pumpkin cider bisque, cheese platter, and chocolate molleux with pistachio gelato are amazing. The staff are courteous and accommodating...top notch service all the way around!Charming resort, stunning views, very quite very, good service from check in to checkout.Scones are baked fresh in the morning and coffee is complimentary at the bar, and you can have your breakfast or any meal for that matter creek side.Food .We were presented with only a Five course menu for 69 pp or so and at 9 pm after traveling all day was not a great idea, other options is room service that I did not find that great. As the options are pretty limited or you can have a very limited bar menu .Bed was not that comfortable and rooms are a bit dated .Tipthe town has lots of dining options , looks dark if you arrive at night however the next day we spotted all of them.This review is for the weekend brunch here only since we didn't stay here. We were seated along the river in the shade. It was a beautiful place to be among the babbling brook, happy ducks, and other patrons enjoying some shade away from the hot AZ sun. We had some ricotta beignets and eggs benny. Both were served hot and were delicious. The service was also good. Best part was the truly free valet parking. When I tried to give them a tip when they brought our car around, he kindly said valet was a free service and they couldn't take tips. I wish other places were like that too.We only stayed at L'Auberge for one night but it was well worth the splurge. The staff is very welcoming and made sure that our stay was nothing short of perfect. Our dog was treated like a puppy prince. He was given a leash  and hiking bowl as a gift as well as a bag of treats from the Dog Bakery in town. The setting is gorgeous and puts you in instant relaxation mode with the sound of the creek always present. We ate lunch, dinner and breakfast at the restaurant and enjoyed every meal, but dinner was the highlight. Our favorite touch though was having a cheese plate waiting in our room for us after we checked in. I have never had that happen at any resort/hotel and it definitely made us feel very VIP.This has been a magical retreat from the hustle and bustle of home. From the moment we arrived at the Valet and were greeted by name, to the crib that was already in our cottage when we were brought in we have thoroughly enjoyed our time here at L'Auberge De Sedona.As people who travel extensively both for business and pleasure, it was an amazing departure from the ""corporate"" resort experience staying at L'Auberge. Our room was not a room, it was a stand alone cottage with ...get this awesomeness... an outdoor shower! This week during our stay it dropped below freezing and I think I am in love with showering outside under the stars when it is 21 out. Our cottage was called a spa cottage and this was very apparent in the level of luxury in our bathroom. An indoor spa-style shower, a beautiful jetted tub, the aforementioned outdoor shower as well as wonderful soaps, scrubs, and salts.Across from our cottage was a two story ""lodge"" building with a wood burning fireplace and as this is the holiday season it was also decked out in the holiday greenery one would hope to see.Every staff member in the resort knew us by name and seemed almost excited to assist us with whatever we needed whenever we needed it. There are activities planned each day for guests such as an 8AM duck feeding at the creek, which I wanted to talk about now for a moment.About 3 cottages from where we were was a path down to a private creek-front bank with outdoor bench swings, chairs, tables, and room service ready to coddle you while you watch the ducks quack lazily by... amazing.Room service which I touched on in a different review also was rich, filling, and wonderfully fresh. The dining room was also fantastic and I recommend you read the reviews and try it yourself.At one point there was apparently a leak where my vehicle had been parked and I was called and asked if they may take my vehicle to have it washed or reimburse me for a carwash... All in all, we will absolutely return next Winter to L'Auberge Du SedonaThis place amazes me every time we come. What an experience to be surrounded by such a caring staff. They spend time to get to know you (without being overly annoying!). We're traditionally able to get an early check in, and in the rare instance it's not available, they go out of their way to let you know the status.The grounds are immaculate. I'd recommend staying in a creek-side cabin. Very spacious... living area and an outdoor shower!Overall, I'm not sure what this place can do to improve upon anything!Albeit overpriced, this is a lovely resort and location deficient in customer service.  The ""no tipping"" policy, which is replaced by a mandatory 10% of room rate fee applied daily, is most likely the chief factor here.  Employees are guaranteed tips so are not particularly attentive to the needs of guests.  (Socialism vs. free enterprise at work - the difference between the postal service and Fedex).  The facilities could use updating,  especially the pool - too small for laps.  The gym is sparsely equipped with two treadmills, an elliptical and free weights.  The complimentary shuttle service sounds like a good idea but is extremely limited in range.    Beware of their 11:00 A.M. checkout!  Although we paid for three rooms, including a cottage at $480 plus tax, we were only able to secure a miserly 12:00 noon check-out upon request.I have to admit that I knew nothing L'auberge when I booked a 2 night stay.  I found a deal on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftravelzoo.com&amp;s=1d53c8d4824c81f8f72f8aa9c8b359cf19193d94e9f33d0ac87d0567a7c036e1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">travelzoo.com</a> and when I compared the rates and location to other resorts in Sedona, it ended up being the best deal.  Turns out, staying at L'auberge at full price would have been worth every penny.  The resort gives first class service from the moment you pull in to the second you check out.  It was like getting VIP treatment all weekend long.  The lovely views and tranquil setting made it the perfect place to take my girlfriend on a weekend trip, where she would leave as my fiance.The room is fantastic.  I ending up booking a lodge room.  It's in a house that consists of four rooms, and a living room with a fireplace.  It felt like we were staying a cabin rather than a resort.  If your having a wedding or some other big gathering at L'auberge, I highly recommend making sure you get a group in this house.  The room was a pretty good size and just a couple of feet from the creek and the restaurant.  Other rooms may offer a nice view of the mountains but this was still an great site.  It certainly doesn't have a modern feel to it, but I actually appreciate the classic atmosphere.  Having a Keurig coffee maker in the room and two bottle of water each day was also a nice touch.The service is awesome.  The extra 10% fee (based on your room) is worth every penny.  This acts as gratuity with all services except the restaurant and the spa.  Not only was it nice not to need cash to tip the valet, the bellhop, shuttle driver, the maid, etc., but it also allowed me to take advantage of L'auberge's services instead of avoiding it.  I was also amazed at just how accommodating the staff is, despite the fact that they are not working for a tip.The location is also a major plus.  L'auberge is literally under uptown Sedona and just minutes from everything.   We took advantage of the shuttle service a couple of times, but since the weather was pretty good during our trip, we ended up walking to quite a few places as well.  If my fiance and I decide to go on another weekend trip to Sedona, L'auberge will definitely be one of the first places we'll consider staying.The hotel was nice enough and the restaurant was lovely. However, after we complained about the valet taking something out of our luggage that we had left in the car, the customer service was dreadful.I got married here 2 years ago and we still talk about how amazing our time there was. the wedding was perfect but it was the small things they did to make the experience a WOW! one instance was I needed some tape for a bag that broke before our rehearsal dinner so just as a last resort called the front desk and asked if we could borrow someones tape roller for a quick fix on the way to a restaurant in town... they did WAAAY better! They sent someone to our door with a roll of tape like its something requested everyday. Everything is 5 star, the food, atmosphere, spa, people, rooms. Was there again in April, we fed the ducks, wandered around and took in the beautiful creek setting. Definatly a wonderful resort!This is my third stay there and wow what a fantastic place. The staff is excellent and courteous and always there to assist you. The hotel and restaurant is right on the creek with ducks and other wildlife all over the place the rooms were amazing each one was a cottage. This was a wonderful weekend I would highly recommend staying hereAbsolutely and unquestionably an exceptional retreat.Came here for a long weekend spa retreat, and this place was highly recommended by American Express.  Availability looked a little sparse, so I rang the hotel directly, and the fantastic lady on the phone offered me an even better rate than what Amex were giving me, and thus my reservation was booked for a spa cottage.Upon arrival, I found the check-in process to be lovely, discreet, and highly personalized.  Valet staff were totally on point, and walked us to our cottage with bags in tow, and assisted in explaining where everything was, how it all worked, and offered any help necessary.  The spa cottage was amazing.  The linens were lovely, making getting out of them an exercise in willpower.  The outdoor shower was quite interesting, particularly when the mornings were a little cool, but a wonderful way to wake up.  On the other hand, the luxurious Jacuzzi tub was perfect for relaxing and soaking in, leading one to just pad over to the fireplace and relax after getting out.  Each cottage is well-positioned for maximal privacy, and even the outdoor deck, overlooking a koi pond, was discreet and perfect for kicking back and taking in the peace.The spa was spectacular, and I cannot speak poorly about any service offered, although the best would have had to be the creekside massage.  90 minutes of wonderful work performed on you, while soothed by a burbling creek alongside your massage table.Interestingly, they'd had a computer glitch, and a few months after my visit charged me a no-show fee.  A quick call to the property and chat with the GM, who remembered me and warmly asked how I was, resulted in everything being reversed without needing to get Amex involved in the process.  All in all, this is a place I would be keen to go back to on a regular basis.Very pleasurable experience here. When you are here you forget you are in a desert. The restaurant is right on the creek and is very romantic.Stayed here with my family last weekend.  It was our first visit.  This place is top notch.  My favorite part was the cabin with the Red Rocks views.  The cabin had a wooden deck with three chairs, a table, and an umbrella.  The room had a regular shower, an outdoor shower, and a jet bath tub with views of the Red Rocks.  My wife loved the restaurant with creek side tables and the spa.  She got a creek side massage.  My boys enjoyed the 8am duck feedings and the pool.I liked the $30/day gratuity policy.  It was easier that tipping throughout the day.  The service is perfect.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.Since the Red Rock view cabins are up a small hill, we used the golf carts the first day.  After that first ride, my 1 year old would only travel by golf cart.  They also have a Mercedes shuttle for drop offs/pick ups in town.In the morning, they are complimentary scones, muffins, coffee, hot chocolate in the lobby.  We would stop there after the 8am duck feeding.  Outside the lobby, next to the valet, there is a wooden chest full of ice cold bottled water. We would stop there a few times a day.  They also provided little chocolates and bottle water during the evening turndown service.The salt water pool is on the smaller size, but fine for a small resort.  They could use a couple of more umbrellas out there.The restaurant was great.  We got the four course meals which included two apps, entree, and desert.  Dining next to the creek was outstanding.  We made an early reservation since we had kids, but the creek seems to relax everyone, so our dinner was quiet.When we return to Sedona, we'll stay at L'Auberge and get the Red Rocks view cabin.","Excellent in all aspects. From the property's stunning creekside beauty to the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. Our room was located in the lodge on the top floor and had a stunning view of the beautiful red rocks behind the property. We fed ducks in the morning [don't laugh, we're city girls], star-gazed with Astronomer, Dennis Young, and jacuzzi'd under the stars until midnight.We were celebrating my daughters birthday and graduation combined, and discovered champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us when we entered our room. Every member of the staff we passed during our 2 day stay greeted us with big smiles, and the concierge service was impeccable. Staff gratuities are included in a daily resort fee, so we never had to worry about reaching into our pockets for bills.Cottages are all the ""rage"" at L'Auberge, but we actually think our room was the best value. If I were to invest in a cottage, I would only get the best...which are the units facing the creek [I think those are like $1500.00 a night...ouch]. The other cottages don't have views, so I can't see the point of paying the $600.00/night price tag. We spent just over $250.00 a night [inclusive] and couldn't have been more pleased with our room.On top of that, L'Auberge allows pets. I know...I know...at first you might be turned off. But once the kids leave home, our pets become our babies and management at L'Auberge understands that. While I didn't bring my dog, I could have. That goes a long way for pet lovers.Thank you L'Auberge for your 5 star service. You truly deserve all those diamond awards hanging on your walls!We'll be back. You can count on it.My wife and I just checked in yesterday for our 30th Wedding Anniversary getaway. So far this property is AMAZING! We purchased a package deal for 4 days and 3 nights through Travel Zoo. Valet met us on check-in and were fantastic. They made special accommodations for our bicycles as there really wasn't a place for them at our detached cabin. As we walked around the resort our first night we were astounded! Beautiful creek side sitting areas, serene creek running next to the property. Bottled water placed for guests throughout the property, what a simple but thoughtful gesture.Out Vista cottage is amazing as well with a beautiful view of the red bluffs from our private deck.Unless something changes drastically during our stay, this is definitely a 5 Star rating! I'll update if anything 'falls apart' or I feel the need to reduce the rating for any reason.Thumbs up L'Auberge De Sedona!We've just returned from perhaps the most enjoyable resort getaway I've ever experienced! The L'Auberge De Sedona is absolutely wonderful, in every way. As other Yelpers have mentioned, the staff members were genuinely friendly, addressed us by name and were anxious to help make our stay as enjoyable as possible at every opportunity. The property is perfectly located on the banks of beautiful Oak Creek with lots of trees and privacy yet conveniently located within walking distance to downtown Sedona.  If you prefer, the resort provides free transportation anywhere in the local area. The view of the red rocks is obstructed in some areas due to the trees, however there are rooms on the upper level with balconies that appear to have fantastic views if that is what you're looking for. The Spa Cottages are individual units with a fireplace, deck, luxurious bathrooms and of course the private outdoor showers! As others have said, there's nothing like showering in 22 degree weather, after soaking in a hot jacuzzi tub! The small, intimate bar in the main lobby is a wonderful place to enjoy a cocktail or glass of wine and visit with other guests. We had two delicious meals (don't miss the pumpkin cider bisque) and wished we'd have eaten in their restaurant rather than one in town where we were very disappointed. The resort fee covers gratuities for housekeeping, valet, shuttle service, bell hop, etc.  All you have to do is arrive, relax and enjoy! This was a wonderful place to spend my birthday, I felt pampered the entire time and hope it becomes an annual birthday celebration tradition!Just got back from a ""mini"" honeymoon for a few days.  Awesome location, service and dining.Sedona is a beautiful place to go to this time of year and we truly enjoyed the creek-side cottage we stayed in.  The sound of Oak Creek running by was added music and we were able to focus on each other and not worry about being taken care of.Thanks Staff at L'auberge for everything you did to make this a great quick getaway.The BrewersWe came with friends to celebrate my husbands birthday.   This was our first visit to Sedona. We were captivated by the beauty of the red rocks as soon as we entered the high desert.  As we drove into  Sedona, we found the steep driveway to L'Auberge De Sedona.   I knew upon stepping out of our car that we were in for a special treat.  The resort is situated on beautiful Oak Creek with ducks swimming about.  Porch swings and chairs line the bank of the creek for your relaxation. The pool and hot tub are set right off the exercise room. There is 8am yoga for no extra charge, as well as star gazing at night with a very knowledgable guide.  The spa cottages are spacious and warmly decorated, including a gas burning fire place. The large deck has a table and chairs and a lounger for relaxing.  I enjoyed a bubble bath in the  jetted tub that overlooks a beautiful outdoor garden area.   Feel free to take your shower inside or out! The room includes both options.  The setting is quiet and peaceful like a little slice of heaven.   There is a $25 per day resort fee which covers all tips except the dining room and spa.  Many hotels are now charging this fee and you get nothing in return. Our car was filled with bottled water every time we went out. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway. We were fortunate to experience two days of beautiful sunshine and then to wake up on our third morning to a deck full of snow in March! It snowed all day and we went out and about to capture the scenery in the snow with the back drop of the amazing red rock. Don't miss this very special spot. Book your room now and enjoy the beauty of the hotel and Sedona. I'm already planning my next visit!We've come back again as we love it here! We just had to point out what a great job each and every staff person we engaged with does here at this resort. We were celebrating my husband's birthday July 4th and the resort was under remodelng so the staff had to accommodate under these circumstances. Everyone from the time we pulled up to valet....Makau, J.P., Beau, etc do a FANTASTIC job!!!!  Thank you! Many of the staff who do turndown or room service were so incredibly gracious...thank you to Edgardo.  Before our room was ready and every meal (which we love the restaurant and have dined there numberous times) we spent time in the bar area and CONNOR WAS SUPERB!!!! Thank you Connor for taking such good care of us each and every time we saw you. You made our stay great!  We so enjoyed our time with you while we were waiting for our room...you have an electric personality and super customer service. Thanks for also making sure our July 4th birthday dinner celebration was fun.  On that note...thank you to Gem for waiting on us at lunch and dinner --- you are the best!!!!!  Finally, thanks to Marlo - the manager - who made sure repeat guests such as ourselves ultimately would enjoy our dinner on this special evening. L'Auberge management....please express our gratitude to these fine folks!!! See you again very soon!!!!This is my new favorite hotel in the US. I loved how peaceful the entire resort is from the creekside dining and swings to the large rooms and balconies. All of the staff was friendly and helpful. The grounds are so clean and beautiful. They have a car service that can take you into town for dinner and they bring you bottled water and anything you need to the room. We felt so taken care of! The views are also stunning, the beds super comfortable, the jacuzzi tub and outdoor showers are amazing as well. Lots of luxury!I will definitely be back again. I want to go every year now. Sedona is wonderful but staying at L'Auberge De Sedona made it extra special. Give yourself a treat and stay here!Just stayed at L'Auberge for our second time within the past 10 months. We stayed in a cottage, which we liked very much. The option of the outdoor shower is a nice touch. Also , the staff was overall nice and helpful and the atmosphere is pleasing and relaxing. There were , however, a few negatives associated with this stay which we did not experience during the last stay. We were not aware that the property is undergoing a major reconstruction of the lobby, bar , kitchen, veranda and dining room area. The check in is in a temporary location and was a bit disorganized. The first morning we went looked for an area to have breakfast and were directed to the cheek side . A buffet was offered tag $35 per person. We did not want a buffet meal so we attempted to order from the menu. My wife wanted the"" Chef's Quiche"" and was advised that none had been made. She then tried to order one egg with toast and was advised that  the chef would not prepare that. We then asked what we were allowed to have from the menu and settled for some side orders. Having dined there for breakfast and riverside dinner during our last stay, this experience seemed unbelievable. We then noticed that the chef and cooking staff are operating out of a tent. Thus they are probably doing the best they can in view of their situation. Based on the breakfast experience, we cancelled or reservations for four at the creek side for that evening . Would advise anyone  considering this hotel during the next few months to be aware of the construction situation in their decision making process. Also, think the hotel should have advised those with reservations of the limited service and disruptions associated with it. No doubt, this will be an excellent choice for  a relaxing, upscale stay once their major project is completed.Holy fancypants, Batman! Sedona itself is gorgeous. Add a creek-side resort like L'auberge into the mix and you've got yourself a wildly romantic setting. I've been taking a lot of beautiful vacations lately, but this spot takes the prize. From the personal greeting in the lobby to the chic toiletries in our room, the entire experience was exceptional. If you're not impressed with L'auberge after just a few moments, you're either anti-romance or just one of those people who's never going to be satisfied. We stayed in a gorgeous ""rustic"" (hardly rustic with a four-poster bed and crisp, white sheets) cabin near the water. Yes, we could watch the ducks from the comfort of our front door. When we walked in, there was even classical music playing from the flat screen TV on the mantle. They even had dry firewood ready for us to throw into the fireplace at night - and you'll need it since it does get chilly once the sun goes down. Keep in mind that there's not much to do here besides spend time with your S.O., so if you're a little unsure about someone, this is NOT the place to go - the potential for awkward interactions abounds. Expensive awkward interactions. And don't bring the kiddies, 'cause they'd hate it. But I digress... If you are sure that you like someone (or even more than like them), L'auberge is the place to just soak in all the romance. You can get massages, drink champagne on the patio, use the outdoor shower, eat a fantastic meal at the in-house restaurant or just watch TV in bed. Although our stay was only one night, this was definitely a memorable spot. I would absolutely stay here again or at one of their other locations. Five-star service and accommodations for sure!Amazing French restaurant on the Oak Creek river. Not cheap. But worth the visit especially if you get to sit outside.The most beautiful and romantic resort I've ever stayed at so far! Wonderful service and the food at its own restaurant was excellent also. We stayed at the creek side cottage where we could see the beautiful creek and nature. The room was cozy with a fireplace and had an outdoor shower. The resort offers many activities and my favorite one being the duck feeding at 8 am. I know it's kinda silly, but the duckies are so adorable :) The place is just out-of-the-world romantic, quaint, lovely and an once in a lifetime experience. Thanks to my man, I'm a lucky girl!You get what you pay for, right?  That's what I'm told anyway.  During our Sunday brunch last week, we definitely spent some $$$ and it was money well spent.  The service is impeccable, the tables and chairs comfortable, and the  sights and sounds of eating next to the creek was super relaxing. The silver and flatware were top-notch, and of course the food.  That's why we came, the food!  Well at $54 a head plus tax and tip, I'm definitely anticipating some good eats.  And the chefs and entire staff delivered.  Everything was expertly prepared and seasoned to perfection, without a missed beat.  Usually I browse a brunch and find one or two good things.  Not here, everything was tasty from the eggs Benedict to the sausages and Mimosas  and Bloodys.  Even the coffee and OJ was far above par.  Check it out!Had high expectations and was very disappointed. Service was sub par and sloppy. The room was fine and really liked the outdoor shower. But had a real issue getting our room cleaned the day before our departure. We slept in late and when the cleaning person knocked on the door around 8:30a we asked her to come back later. We left around 10a to go hiking and came back around 3p. The room was still not cleaned. We called the front desk for clean towels so we could get ready for dinner and let them know we were leaving at 5p so they could clean the room then. The cleaning person arrived about 30 minutes later and we asked her to come back at 5p. Had a great dinner at Elote and arrived back to the room around 7p. We were met with a pile of dirty towels and an unclean room. Delightful! Called the front desk to complain and no one answered the phone so scooted on down there in person. We explained what happened to the young lady at the front desk and she asked if we would like to speak with the manager on duty. We said yes and then had to wait another 10 minutes. We told our story AGAIN and she apologized and that was it. She did not seem genuine and just ticked us off even more. So sad! Stay somewhere else. Not worth the money. Sloppy and subpar service.This review is for the restaurant only. I'd probably need a sugar daddy to be able to stay at a place like this.The lunch experience at the restaurant outside is exquisite. My friend and I were seated right alongside the creek on a gorgeous sunny day, and were immediately served breadsticks with an insanely delicious dipping sauce. It was some sort of olive tapenade aioli concoction. It was so good, I had to order fries just so I could have more stuff to dip into it.We both had salads: the seared ahi tuna nicoise and the dungeness crab. Neither one blew our minds; I'd give them 3 stars at best.But the setting and the service have earned this place an extra star in my book. Now, if I can only find that sugar daddy.Side note: valet is complimentary and the attendants cannot accept tips. The fact that they are still so friendly and accommodating (try finding that back home in LA!) makes it all the better.The wife and I went to the Spa here for some services and relaxation.  The spa has a very cozy feel to it.  The services we both got were amazing.  It was fitting to be at the spa when we went due to the cold weather outside.  I would definitely go back!This place is pure heaven! From the second we arrived to the moment we left they made us feel like royalty. They personalized our entire stay, it was like the hole staff knew it was my birthday. Every corner we turned someone was saying ""happy birthday"" or congratulating us on our baby on the way making me feel extremely special! A beer was even dropped out of our bag as we arrived to check in and they ran to the bar to replace it for us immediately. We would have never expected that, so we were pretty impressed! Check-in process was so easy &amp; quick and everyone was extremely nice and welcoming. We stayed in a lodge room because of our budget, we were a little bummed before because the cottages were so beautiful, but the lodge rooms were so nice and cozy we were so pleasantly surprised! We had a beautiful view and the bed was extremely comfortable. We were even greeted with chocolate covered strawberries &amp; sparkling wine in our room, such a nice touch! We enjoyed couples massages at the spa which were incredible! I had Nora, and she was fantastic! Made me feel extremely relaxed and comfortable and I enjoyed every second of my maternity massage! We even made our own body scrub afterwards with a different blend of healing scents &amp; spices which was such a fun experience! Breakfast, lunch, &amp; dinner were all FANTASTIC at the creekside restaurant. Dinner was so fabulous I would give it 10 stars if I could!!! Everything not only looked beautiful on the plate, but tasted incredible! It was too cold to have our dinner by the creek unfortunately, but the next day we were able to enjoy lunch outside, and seriously nothing beats that creekside dining experience! The entire property is just so beautiful and serene. This place is perfection and went way beyond our expectations, and we will definitely be back!I stayed in this wonderful property on my last visit to the area.  The staff was professional, attentive and extremely helpful.  We loved the cabin like room (espeically the outdoor cedar shower!)The restaurant was delightful, the food was superb and the service was top notch.  My only complaint would be the slow service in the bar while waiting for a table.  But that aside this place deserves the great reviews.I highly recommend both the hotel and restaurant.JoyA few aspects of the hotel bumped the rating a star. (The restaurant, Day shift lobby bar staff, lack of microwave)My husband suprised me with a trip to Sedona for my birthday and did a great job when he picked this hotel to stay. We stayed 3 weekday nights. Staff was very attentive from start to finish, they include tips in the daily rate, which I usually don't like because staff tends to slack if they know they already have their tip, but it was not the case at this establishment. They have little electric carts to drive you up the hill to town whenever you want, just give them a call and they'll pick you back up. Staff is always ready and willing to offer advice of where to eat and things to do.Our cabin was cozy, loved the quiet environment down by the creek. We put our wood burning fireplace to good use. We didn't get to use our patio but we did take a stroll by the creek, just a few feet away from our cabin. Lots of seats by the water, to just relax and watch the ducks.We didn't get to partake in any of the hotels free activities, but we did score some cookies from the lobby in the evening. Yum!The bed was huge and super comfy. I'm not a lazy S.O.B. but I loved they had a remote control for the air conditioner/heating system. I was bummed they didn't have a microwave in the room, but we dealt with it fine.A few aspects of the hotel bumped the rating a star. (The restaurant, Day shift lobby bar staff, lack of microwave)We encountered a bit of rudeness from a male bartender during our first day and we had issues with the restaurant (see separate review), but it didn't ruin our stay one bit.There were definitely positives about the lauberge, but given the price you're paying per night and the reviews of the resort, we were not impressed. We first encountered nicole at the reception and if our experience had been that good the rest of the time, i woudl have rated the place much higher. We stayed in a spa cottage, which was a great room with a luxurious bathroom and outdoor cedar shower. The scenery by the creek was also a real treat for dinner, and our server, Cheryl, was very professional and hospitable. The shuttle driver, berto, was also a friendly staff member and was the most helpful of all the valets. However, these positives were few and far between. Our room had no mini bar beverages or snacks, so we were bound to the restaurant (which sat the terrace intermittently) if we wanted food - or we had to take the shuttle to restaurants in Sedona. We did take the shuttle one afternoon and asked to get a ride to a grocery store, which was 1.2 miles from the resort - they said the shuttle only transports within 1/2 mile of the resort. It took my husband calling back and speaking with the manager to make it happen. Second, we returned from a day out around 2:30 to find that our room was still not cleaned. Again, we called the front desk. There were a number of times when we passed the valet stand or entered the restaurant and no one acknowledged us. It was very uncomfortable. As another review mentioned, the tipping policy is confusing and leaves you wondering who to tip and when.Overall, the service was just not what you would expect from a top-rated resort and when you're paying upwards of $600 per night. While I certainly wouldn't classify this as a horrible experience, I would suggest to anyone expecting 5-star service to stay somewhere else.L'auberge is TOP SHELF !!!!!!There is not much to add to all of the glowing reviews below. There was not a single negative aspect to this peaceful, decadent hotel. It is expensive, and worth every penny. The service is unbeatable. You can call them for any thing you need - big or little. A few adds to others reviews... GET BRUNCH!!!  The brunch was so incredibly yummy, by far one of the best I have ever had. Sitting nestled at a quiet table by the creek, enjoying oysters, organic salads, prime rib, flourless chocolate cake, and endless mimosas. Wow. We spent one of the best days I have had in a very long time staying on the property all day on a Sunday.  Woke amidst soft cotton sheets with fluffy pillows, ordered mimosas from room service (they arrived in under five minutes), sat in fluffy bathrobes on the deck beneath the trees as the creek babbled by, dressed casually, wandered 50 yards down to the restaurant for a world-class brunch, shared quiet conversation as the sun dappled down amidst the trees, tossed on swimsuits to lay in the sun on the deck and read the NYT, meandered over to the spa for body scrub and massages, followed by more sunbathing, naps, and then an amazing dinner creekside with a fabulous wine list, delectable scallops and duck, and then back to those comfy slippers and sheets for a quiet night listening to the creek and cicadas. Totally peaceful.L'auberge is extra.ordinary !!!!!","['refreshed', 'know', 'using', 'typically', 'post', 'end', 'post', 'starting', 'better', 'way', 'describe', 'felt', 'spending', 'weekend',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/poco-diablo-resort-sedona,Poco Diablo Resort,4.0,$$,95,"This place is so well kept and the customer service is fantastic!  So dog-friendly as well, they gave my doggy a little welcome bag with treats and a travel bowl - how sweet!  The rooms are large, and feel luxurious, they smell like warm fresh laundry too, loved it!  The outdoor area was vast so London (my pup) could run around and play with other fur-friends.  We grabbed some grapes and cheese from Whole Foods not too far away, and sat outside in the sun and snacked.  It's beautiful here, and so affordable.  It's near the town shops, restaurants and trails are only about a mile away. I can't say enough nice things about this place, love-love!**One thing I was upset by, but management handled EXTREMELY WELL - I forgot my engagement ring like a doh-doh brain. I was sweating bullets, my fiance spent a fortune on it and I felt so irresponsible = (. I only realized I left it when I was already 2 hours outside of Sedona, when I called about my ring they said that house-keeping only found my earrings and other jewelry - NO ENGAGEMENT RING - my heart dropped to my stomach.  FUNNY THE HOUSE-KEEPER CONVENIENTLY DIDN'T TURN IN MY ENGAGEMENT RING BUT DID TURN IN EVERYTHING ELSE (LESS VALUABLE).  It's a beautiful custom ring, so I can imagine anyone would be tempted.  When I expressed my anger and disappointment, demanding to speak to house-keeping, it was somehow magically ""found by the door"".  Shame on the house-keeper that thought she could get away with it.  Either way, my fiance and I are sooooo grateful management handled this and got my ring back!We would love to come back here! Just don't forget your valuables hah!Stayed at Poco for a few nights in October. The staff was very nice and helpful. The views are beautiful. The breakfast and dinners were good. Our issue  was when we decided to go out on our balcony before dinner to have some wine and cheese and take in the beautiful views. Unfortunately the couple next to us came out to sit on thier balcony. Both of them smoking. The smell pretty much blowing into our patio the entire time. I called the front desk. Front desk said they can smoke on the patio not in the rooms. Bummer. I am not going to sit outside if there are people pretty much right next to me smoking. Also, the smoke was blowing into the rooms.We decided to go to dinner and sit outside to see the beautiful views. Great dinner until about four people light up right below us.  Waiter said people can smoke down on the concrete area below the patio. Dont see why Poco can't make the smokers move to the other side of the pond. Instead they are allowed to smoke right below people dining. You might as well let them smoke in the outside dining area. If you are a bothered by cigarette smoke Poco would be a bad choice.Poco I wish you could make a non smoking section for customers who want to sit on their patio and not have someone lighting up on the patio right next to them. I did find a few very nice smoke free properties during my three days at Poco. If Poco does not change their policy regarding smoking at least we found some places we can go to in the future.My first impression of Poco Diablo was very positive... the grounds are beautiful with views all around, the service on the phone was extremely courteous, and the amenities were plentiful.  When we checked in our rooms weren't ready yet (we were there early in the day to catch a wine tour) but the staff helped us put our luggage out of the way so someone else in our party could check in later, and they didn't mind a couple of people and a baby hanging out in the lobby/restaurant area until the rooms were available.Once we got settled in to the rooms, one thing because quickly apparent -  the walls are paper thin.  We learned a lot about our next door neighbors, and our neighbors learned a lot about babies hehe.  Our room overlooked a large outdoor fireplace, which attracted a late crowd.  This would have been fine, but for the aforementioned walls.  Every word they said floated up and into our room as audible as if we were sitting next to them by the fire.  Maybe I could have slept through all these things if the beds had been softer...All that said, the rooms were really nice.  They were huge, with a large desk area, fridge with counter space, a couple chairs, and lots of open room in the middle.  I wish we'd had time to enjoy more of the resort.  If I was looking for somewhere nice to stay in Sedona when I'm not just after the best price, I would probably return...as long as I could request a room farther from common areas ;)We just had a wonderful time staying at this resort, and the views are simply resplendent!From the moment we walked in, although it was late at night; the staff was polite, efficient, and cheerful.Check-in was a breeze, and the place was just serene. We could not have asked for a better place to stay in Sedona. We had a single story suite right by the Green, and the only minor annoyance that we experienced was the lack of nearby parking. We actually had to park at the other end of the row of the two story complex. Not too far, but a minor annoyance nonetheless. At first, I was concerned with security because mine was the only car over at that lot in a dark night, but my concern was unfounded - my car was fine in the morning.Speaking of the morning, when we opened curtains that covered the door to our private patio, we were greeted with just a marvelous view of the golf course and the surrounding mountains. Just simply spectacular!Our room was well appointed and spacious. Very ergonomic; especially for those of us that are workaholics and work during vacation times.My only quibble was the high speed internet was not very high speed. It was only good for checking email, but nothing else. Unfortunately, Suddenlink appears to be the only Internet Provider in Sedona, and they are constrained in their facilities. This may not get resolved anytime soon. But, for those that enjoy the atmosphere and the facilities, this place is top notch. The staff is just extremely congenial; especially William who handled our checkout. Another notable part of our experience was that all the guests we encountered, and had the pleasure of chatting with were just so friendly. I think they serve happy pills in this place. Even the couple whose wife was on wheelchair, whose vehicle I happened block with mine because we were loading up the car were just so patient and never minded the slight delay.I would truly recommend this as a great destination and a quiet respite from the hustle and bustle of life.As we were driving here I started to call around and the first place I called was Paco Diablo resort. I figured I might get a cheaper price by calling than booking a hotel through Hotwire last minute. I was right. Got the AAA discount and it was well worth it. For a room with a hot tub and it was awesome. The jets were OK and it was loud but definitely worth it for a one time thing. William who works the front desk or concierge depending when you come is awesome and so helpful. Make sure you tip when he spends 10 min mapping out all the sites for you.Stayed in one of their red rock view suites with fireplace, and really enjoyed myself. I had a little flock of ducks that hiked across the golf course from the pond twice a day to see if I wanted to share any bread with them. Be aware they will walk right in the room if you leave the screen door ajar. Nicely appointed room, phenomenal view of a gorgeously landscaped course, great breakfast buffet on the deck of their restaurant ""T Carl's"".As a side note, I extended  my stay an extra night (Saturday) and was given a steeply discounted rate without even asking. Gratuitous kindnesses like that go a long way with me.Two small complaints - the freezer in the mini fridge was essentially useless, and room service got two of four orders wrong.Overall, the minor complaints didn't detract from the sheer gorgeousness of the property. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.What an amazing time at Poco Diablo. We selected this hotel based on the dog friendly reviews. Originally booked 4 nights but enjoyed it so much that we stayed another night.The grounds were amazing and our room was fantastic. Close to the doggie relief area, beautiful view of the golf course and close to the out door patio with fire place and water fountains.The customer service was outstanding, especially Mary at registration. My dog Max loved her! She was so welcoming and the food and food device was great. This will be are go to place when we visit Sedona again in a few months!My fiance and I stayed at the Poco Diablo Resort on August 14th, 15th and 16th. It wasn't until the 17th when we were driving through Nevada that my fiance recalled that I moved his collared shirt some where, and asked if I grabbed it. I immediately called Poco Diablo and explained what happened and that I left his shirt in the closet on a hanger. I asked that if they found it to please mail it back to us, obviously I would pay for postage as it was my bad. Last week I received the package with the shirt in it. The customer service they gave was incredible, the next time we are in Sedona, we will definitely be going back to this place! It was gorgeous, relaxing and just all around amazing!Thank you Poco!What a beautiful resort! I had a wonderful time here while I was here for my Brother and now Sister in laws beautiful wedding. The weekend we were here the weather was bad and rainy but it turned out nice for the ceremony so they were able to have it out by the gazebo. The photographer took a lot of pics by the nice red rocks and little streams as well as the pretty trees on the property. Our rooms were very spacious, we had the king rm with the jet tub. It had a nice couch, and a chair with an ottoman. The desk also has a nice vanity make up mirror that lights up with different settings.We also had a wet bar in our room. I really liked the round coffee table, it looked really elegant. The only bummer was that our bed could have been a Little more comfortable. It wasn't the worst we've ever slept on but it wasn't the best. All in all the resort did a wonderful job with helping my inlaws with everything, including the Service!  It was an enjoyable time, and a weekend of memories that will last a life time!Just checked in and immediately got upgraded to a king room with a spa inside. The woman working the front desk was so helpful and accommodating. I've only been here an hour an I have been blow away. This place is a must stay!We booked through a secret Hotwire deal and this was one of those times where we were happy with what we got. When we checked in... we automatically got upgraded to a king suite! That was so nice. We had a private balcony, fireplace, jacuzzi, mini fridge, and the room was spacious with high ceilings. The location is further from most of the very touristy parts such as a uptown but still close to a few trails especially cathedral rock. They offer free coffee and fruit from 5-8 AM but it's nothing worth waking up early for. There's a restaurant located inside but we never had the chance to try it. Very happy with our stay and I would be glad to pay the regular price.Stayed here with the boyfriend and absolutely loved it!! We were checked in by a guy named Garrett and he was so friendly and loved that we brought our puppy with us! The first night unfortunately our air conditioner wasn't working so the next day we called and were helped by a nice guy named Jon and he moved us to the suite right next door which was nice! We also got room service for pizza and there brownie sundae and Fernando brought it both times and he was so nice and the food was delicious! We loved our view of the golf course and also our room and how friendly everyone was! We will definitely be back and recommend it!Beautiful place with nice rooms - reasonable cost.  No shuttle service and not within walking distance of town however.My family and I stayed at Poco Diablo in May. It was an absolutely amazing experience. From the first phone call I made to the resort through our three day stay I was amazed by the hospitality. My favorite part besides the huge gorgeous room, breath taking view or kind staff was how above and eyond they went for my dad who is a Vietnam Veteran. Not only did we get a great rate but we also got a very sweet card thanking him for his service. It made his entire trip. Such an amazing visit and stay. We will be back soon.We looked at several hotels online to stay at and picked this one because our first pick sold out.  I am so happy about it!  This resort was perfect!  The staff at the front desk was extremely courteous and gave us a free upgrade!  We were traveling with another couple and requested to be put in rooms near each other.  They obliged with no problem what-so-ever.  They also gave us maps of the area and a list of great hikes to try.  Our room was very nice and clean.  Large, with a King bed, seating area, patio, and a jacuzzi tub!  We loved it.  I also really liked that there was a large closet with a full length mirror door.  Across from this was a little ""bar"" type area that had it's own sink and mirror- outside of the bathroom. This was nice so I could do my makeup in the morning and my husband could still use the mirror and sink in the bathroom.  The bed was very comfy- a little on the firm side, which I thought would bother me, but it didn't.  There were several areas for lounging- a couch, two chairs, and a small patio which lead onto the golf course.  The room was decorated modernly with photos of the Sedona area.The location is a little bit off the main road in Sedona, but that was fine with us.  We were still within 5-10 minutes driving of every place we wanted to go.Unfortunately, we didn't get to try the pool or hot tub, as they closed at 10pm and we were too late.  All in all, I would definitely stay here again!We came for a wedding in Sedona so our schedule was a little hectic. Housekeeping was not very accommodating. They came just before we were ready to go to breakfast (abt 9:00 am) and said they would come back. We came back abt 2:00 to get ready and the room was not done. They came again abt 3 and they told me they were leaving early and could not do the room. It was not a huge problem but an example of poor customer service. Other than that how did you like the play Mr Lincoln?  My wife is in a wheel chair so we need an accessible room. It was nice but a little crowded for the chair. Also the shower was VERY tiny.  The breakfast was very good and the view was good. Handicapped parking was lacking for the number of rooms available.  I might stay here again but may explore other options also.My biggest pet peeve when it comes to hotels are the beds. When your sole business is to offer a place tho sleep, the beds should be amazing. The bed was extremely hard. Woke up with a backache. The internet was spotty at best and their paper products were cheap cheap cheap. However, the room was clean and beautiful. The view from the patio was amazing.  Mary at the front desk was very accommodating.Stayed here for a wedding. The wedding started at 4pm and we got to the hotel at noon. We requested an early check-in since we had to get ready for the wedding. At noon, our room wasn't ready. Come back at 130pm and our room still wasn't ready. We were told which room we were blocked for so we went to the room and the room was clean (door didn't shut completely ). We come back at 230pm and were told the room still wasn't ready but then the front desk agent called housekeeping to check the room status and it was indeed ready.  The resort itself is nice. Pet friendly which is great. Just wished that we were able to get into our room that was clean 2 hours earlier.The telephone in my room is a Cisco IP 7940 office phone, the volume on the television doesn't work, concierge has never once answered when I've called, the front desk answers maybe half the time, and I'll be surprised if I'm even able to post this via their pitiful wifi connection. Based on the price, I expected more. The furniture in this suite feels like it was bought at the same place the phone was; a used office furniture superstore. Poco Diablo feels like a retirement community on barbiturates. Look elsewhere.I can not say enough good things about this place. Everything was amazing. I got married here and working with Jill was an amazing experience. The staff and the food were excellent. Will definitely be staying here in the future!","The rooms are super spacious and have great views.  Pet friendly and close to everything, but far from the busy tourist section of Sedona!  The restaurant has good food and well mixed drinks (I liked breakfast more than the dinner).  But the star of the show is the massages.This was a bday surprise, so I unsure of what to expect.  I was initially disappointed that this was not a spa and the massage rooms are located within the tennis court area and gift shop.  However, once you go into the room, you are transported to peaceful, tranquil realm, you completely forget.  I had the Healing Energy massage by Kim.  It was spectacular and very healing!  She was an expert and dare I say it, I think a bit psychic.The resort fee is a ridiculous charge as it only covers 2 water bottles per day and tennis (the charge is per day; per person).Offering complimentary coffee goes a long way. I was waiting for my husband while he was in a meeting.   I asked one of the employees for a cup of coffee and the reply was ""I'm going to have to charge you for that"".  I gave her a $20 and she asked if I had smaller Bills which I didn't.  She gave me $17 back and said she will forget the coins I still owe her since she didn't have change.  My coffee had the flavor of coffee cooking in a pot for awhile.   Another suggestion would be to invest in milk froth machines and cappuccino machines.  I would gladly pay for a good cup of coffee and would feel like I was indulging in a resort setting.  The other thing I would suggest is to count your cash drawers in private.  In 24 hours I saw cash being counted on the counter In front of guests 3 times.  Entire cash tray out on the counter being counted.  At a resort.    Positive notes: loved the view from our room.  Bar tender super personable.  Front desk clerk helpful.Delightful experience. Clean, quite, comfortable. Definitely will return.My husband and I had a blast here. I only wish we could have stayed longer. The pool and hot tub were set at the perfect temperature. Wifi connection was excellent and it was so close to uptown! We will definitely be back !This is a beautiful resort to take your dog too ,Wide open spaces with lots of walking.A great dog park with river next to it..Green green, trees and 3mim to townStay in the 400 rooms and run on golf course at nite...Reservation agent Olya was wonderfulAs were Front desk upon check n..The fella and I booked a night here through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a> and thought it was a nice place. I upgraded our room through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a> a couple days prior to our arrival, and the front desk staff answered my emailed billing question almost immediately. Check-in was easy, the room was pretty big with a gas fireplace and a whirlpool tub, and everything was very clean. Some of the lower walls and the tub were a little scratched up from age, but otherwise it was fine.  Our room overlooked the little golf course and had a sizable balcony with a table and chairs (unfortunately it was too cold out to use!).  There were the standard issue coffee maker with coffee, hair dryer, and bath robes.  I think this is the first place I've actually taken any of the toiletries with me afterward --  I love the lotion they provide.We'd forgotten to pack toothpaste so I called the front desk to ask if they had any for sale. The guy at the front desk arranged for someone to drop two complimentary toothbrush &amp; toothpaste sets at our door 10 minutes later.T. Carls is the on-site restaurant which served pretty darn good breakfast for a reasonable price.  They also serve dinner and I believe lunch, but we partook of neither. We ordered a pizza and beer through room service pretty late; both were enjoyable and arrived quickly.Poco Diablo Resort is a nice place to stay and a good value for the price, and fairly close to town. We experienced excellent customer service and would stay here again.Loved this resort! The rooms are new and very nicely furnished. The view was amazing!! Very nice staff who are very helpful.Had dinner tonight at Poco Diablo Resort.  I am a local and a foodie.  Ordered shrimp cocktail, crab cakes, ribeye steak, and poblano chicken.  The crab cakes were terrible-no crab.  All bread.  The waitress got our salad dressing wrong.  The ribeye (ordered medium) was cooked rare and was flavorless (tastes like old dirty grill)!  Overall a bad experience.  I do not recommend the food at all-terrible!  I spoke to the manager and she only made excuses and failed to comprehend that there was a problem (hello McFly!).  Wine was good.We stayed at the Poco Diablo for a wedding plus mini vacation and we really enjoyed it!  Overall, nice large room, decent food, gorgeous property, excellent massages &amp; very nice accommodations for the military! We brought our two dogs and stayed in a king pet-friendly room with the military rate. The room was huge and had a large jet tub! When we checked in they gave us a cute doggy bag with cookies for the girls. And in the room we were welcomed with a very nice card &amp; fruit/cheese plate. For active duty, they also waived the resort fee and gave us a daily credit towards room service or the restaurant. There was a cute little outdoor seating area with a fireplace and a large grassy area for the dogs right outside our door. We each had a 1hr massage, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The golf course looked nice, but we don't play so no comments there. We ate at the restaurant (T Carl's) for dinner our first night and the food was pretty good; we had the salmon and ordered a bottle of wine.  We ordered room service for breakfast and the omelettes were good and pretty big.This place is old school, comfortable, nice.  The staff are amazingly friendly and down to earth. They allow pets here so lots of guests were walking the grounds with their dogs, and the grounds are lovely, with a golf course, if you're into that.  I was here 3 days and my routine was to leave early and go on hikes and see the sights, then come back, jump in the pool, soak in the hot tub, then have a lovely dinner on the patio overlooking the mountain served by nice ladies that remind me of my mom. Very relaxing!Awesome hotel! We ended up staying here a few weeks ago after our plans to camp in Flagstaff were foiled by a snow storm and there was no availability to camp in Sedona.  They were able to get us in last minute and were very accommodating with the dog in our group.  The hotel and rooms were excellent.  Right outside of our room was a fire pit, an area where we were still able to cook our ""camping meals"", and a picnic table.  All of this was overlooking the golf course and beautiful red rocks.  The rates were even reasonable, as they were able to match the rates from Hotels Tonight.  Although we typically don't stay at resorts, we were very happy with our ""glamping"" experience, and would definitely recommend this hotel!When we pulled up to the hotel, it didn't look like much. But, WOW! The room was huge and elegant. The decor had a natural and elegant look to it. The grounds were gorgeous! The best part was that they were a completely dog friendly hotel. They had ""pick up"" bags everywhere for your convenience and lots of space for our dog to play. Additionally, there were no stipulations such as ""don't leave your dog in the room alone"" so we felt perfectly comfortable walking around town to the less dog friendly places while leaving her in the room for an hour. The restaurant was decent but overpriced. The view and peacefulness made it worth it but the food wasn't anything to write home about. I shared the fruit platter and an omelette with my boyfriend (the fruit plate was around $11 and the omelette was around $10)This is a great place to stay if you want a resort feel and your dog by your side! I wouldn't recommend this place if you don't like dogs - they are everywhere!Beautiful hotel , wish we had more time to enjoy as we were only there for 1 day , beautifully nestled in between red rock , very majestic . People were friendly and attentive. Great deals on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>Coming from Holland we had an issue with another property and the Poco Diablo Resort was a last minute reservation.  They made us feel at home, comfortable, and welcome.  From the phone reservation, to check-in, to check-out, the service was amazing and when we return to Sedona we will definitely stay here.  The grounds were beautiful and the scenery outside our room was spectacular.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.We spent two nights at Poco Diablo Resort and really liked the resort. It was clean, the receptionist was very friendly, the location was good and it was quiet. The resort was spotlessly clean, the room was really nice with a office area, the beds where really comfy, nice shower, toiletries, kettle, fridge, safe and flat screen tv , free wifi , and a back yard people that was open during late house. The reception staff are all professional and gave lot of information on what to see around town. We didn't eat breakfast there as it seemed a bit expensive and there are lots of restaurants in the area that serve breakfast. I would certainly recommend this resort to anyone visiting Sedona.I will definitely be staying here again!  The female manager was fantastic and very helpful, the ladies who cleaned the room were fast, efficient and friendly, and Mario the waiter was great!  My children LOVED Mario.  He was so friendly and nice!  We had an awesome view of the golf course from our room.  Highly recommend this resort! Can't wait to return.Booked a last minute stay at the resort during MLK weekend and could not have had a better experience. Everyone from the front desk to the wait staff at T Carl's were extremely friendly. This resort is also very military friendly and I would highly recommend it. Thank you Poco Diablo resort!Booked a room online through Travelocity, but found out from the front desk attendant that we could've received a better rate by booking directly with the hotel since we were repeat guests (lesson learned for next time). In a town full of $300+ per night rooms, this hotel is one of the better values in Sedona. It's been recently remodeled; the rooms are nicely decorated, very spacious and clean. The beds are very comfy too. The king suites have a jacuzzi, fireplace and a beautiful view of the mountains/golf course. The location is good, just a short drive to the center of town. Tip: if you're a member of the military or are a veteran, mention it upon check-in and they will deliver a fruit/cheese plate to your room. They also comped our breakfast at their restaurant the first time we stayed. Although it wasn't very good, at least it was free and the views were A~MA~ZING! Will definitely stay again. Maybe next time we'll bring our dog since it's pet-friendly :)For a ""resort"", this is definitely not what we expected. The rooms are set up motel style. We had a standard double queen room overlooking the golf course and above the pool area. It was pretty quiet and mostly clean, however we kept finding rogue hairs on all the linens (sheets, napkins, etc) which is a HUGE pet peeve. Though the rooms left something to be desired, the grounds were immaculate and very pretty. Though not very large, we wandered around a bit and stopped by the creek which is tucked behind the villas. Very peaceful and the hotel's hidden gem in my opinion. We had a quick drink in the lounge then ate dinner on the patio at T. Carl's. The meal was good but the ambiance made it that much better as it was a beautiful evening and for most of the night we were the only diners outside and had a private serenade from a lovely guitar player. The staff was friendly and welcoming and we checked out the next morning to head to breakfast in Tlaquepaque which was a two minute drive up the road. Not sure we'd stay here again but for a one night mini-cation from Phoenix it served our purpose.Awesome experience. Comfortable rooms. Excellent view. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Managers worked hard to please.","What a great find.  Decided to stay in Sedona and had our dog with us.  We tried several hotels and either no pets allowed or they wanted $50 extra for the one night.  I went on Yelp and put in pet friendly in Sedona and found this great resort.  The woman at the front dest was so nice.  We are just outside of the grassy, raked, clean pet area and they gave me a gift for  Sharky!  Our room is large and has a huge jacuzzi, free internet, comfortable bed, and is clean.  The price was fair and we will sleep well tonight.  Thank you.My bf and I stayed here for a one night mini vacation. My expectations of this place were definitely exceeded! The resort was nice and clean. The staff was very friendly. The room was big, clean, and modern. The view from our little patio was amazing. About 15 minutes after we checked in, there was a knock on the door and it was a complementary cheese and fruit plate as a gratitude for my boyfriend's service in the military. We don't have any complaints about this place. It's very central to the downtown area. We would stay here again for sure!My boyfriend and I stayed at Poco Diablo this past weekend, and overall it was a great stay. We had his dog with us and the dog-friendly nature of the resort impressed us from the get-go. When we checked in we were given dog treats and a travel water bowl, and then our room was in front of the dog-friendly outdoor area, which made it easy to have her with us during the trip. The room and amenities were nice. My boyfriend thought the room was going to have a king size bed, but I guess the hotel didn't see needing a ""dog-friendly"" room on his reservation, so they had to scramble to find a room. We ended up having two full size beds, which is obviously not a problem, but took away some of the luxury of the stay.Also of note, neither of the hot tubs seemed to be working properly. The one closest to our room was lukewarm and the jets were broken. The main one was also lukewarm and the jets squirted obnoxiously everywhere, which wasn't exactly relaxing. When I stay at a hotel one of the things I look forward to most is the hot tub, so it was disappointing to have such mediocre ones.Beautiful place!  Danielle in reservations set up our group of four couples with gorgeous rooms (upgraded from the room rate we paid for), king comfy beds, fireplace, kitchenette, deep jacuzzi tub, couch, patio... It was so wonderful!  The pool and hot tub area was clean and had quick poolside service!  The drinks and food were really delicious, especially the strawberry margarita, hot wings and shrimp cocktail!What a wonderful resort to stay at in Sedona -and it is only about half the price of other resorts.The location couldn't get much better, it was about a mile away from downtown Sedona and all the shops.  It was also minutes away from great hiking and exploring.The rooms are surrounded by a small golf course, tennis courts, pool, Jacuzzi and tranquility.  Our room had its own Jacuzzi tub, huge living area and outdoor patio that opened up to the golf course.  What a great place to drink wine as the sun was setting.The staff was friendly, there was a concierge that helped with maps, hiking trails and other information.  I highly recommend this cozy location.Rooms: 5Location: 5Value: 5Restaurant: 3Bar: 2There are many options for lodging in Sedona and I've stayed at most of them, this place just rocks. Friendly staff, adorable, and very nice accommodations. They have a  fun 9 hole executive course right on prem, and they don't charge you an arm and a leg to play it. Also 5 min drive into town. A+A pleasant experience. Room was nice and clean, lots of counter space. Pool was pretty good as well. A very family friendly resort and nearby things to do in Sedona.This is a really nice hotel where you can tell they made the effort to remodel the place into something special.  I'll try to keep this easy...Pros: -Check-in went smoothly and whomever checked me in was very informative and helpful-Lots of parking, and it's free-The rooms are large, super clean, and have recently been remodeled-Didn't really hear the neighbors-Mini-fridge-Free Wi-Fi-Allow dogs and they even get their own little doggie-bag with treats-Check-out went smoothlyCons:-Very noisy air conditioner-Outside areas were not so clean-Can hear people walking by outside-Sleep Number beds are overrated-$25 pet fee-Pet rooms are in a little cove of the hotel with no view (our room looked at a wall)It is not located in the downtown area, so you will need to have a car to get where you need to go.  There is a restaurant, pool, hot tub, fitness center, tennis courts, and a golf course on premise.I really enjoyed my time here and think this is a lovely property.  I got a great deal on my room, but after looking at some of their pricing online I might have to say that it fits in with the rest of Sedona - overpriced for what you get.  This is why I'm docking a star.  Perhaps if you stayed here several days and really made use of the facilities the price would be more fair.  But I don't play golf or tennis- I would rather pay less for the room.I would stay here again, but would need a deal in order to do so.Great location, nice rooms, decent restaurant. We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff are very friendly and helpful.Stayed here with 2 kids and a pooch. Very friendly hotel and had all the basics. We were quite surprised by how delicious the lunch was we ended up eating on site there yesterday. Not too badly priced for hotel food, and really quite delicious. They say they're dog friendly and they're not kidding! They are so welcoming to furry family members and those guys received treats and pets around almost every corner. We will definitely come back the next time we come to Sedona.The rooms were large, the decor is dated but the beds are comfortable. The views are great.  and it's a great location, but the restaurant is mediocre. My main problem is that they added resort fees when we checked out. We didn't use any amenities. I assume most nicer hotels in Arizona should have pools and not charge for using them, but regardless we didn't use the pool at Poco Diable. I'm not sure what the ""resort fees"" covered since we weren't told at check-in that we'd have to pay resort fees...or what additional resort amenities were available to us. At check in, the staff claimed they wanted our card for incidentals. They should have just told us they wanted our card to charge us extra fees. The hotel was OK, but we won't be going back. We moved onto an Air B n B situation and were much happier. (No surprise fees.) However, I would recommend it as a pet friendly place. Our friends who also stayed with a large dog were very happy with their experience.I stayed here for an anniversary. The staff at the hotel went above and beyond. As soon as we were greeted in the hotel lobby we received a goody bag for our dog. The resort is very pet friendly. We then asked for some great trails to hike with dogs and we received a wealth of information. The room was very spacious and the hotel grounds were very clean. We also received a happy anniversary card and a complimentary cheese and fruit platter. I would defiantly recommend this hotel!We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights. Place is nice with heated pool which was great for the kids. Rooms were nice and updated.The rating is because the restaurant food there is awful. I mean really bad. We went there for breakfast the first morning we were there and they had a buffet. Cheap for the kids, $6, but the pancakes had been sitting there so long they were stuck to the pan, eggs were nasty and the adults ordered off the menu. I choked down my biscuits and gravy, but only because we were in a hurry.The wait staff didn't really know what they were serving and couldn't answer any questions. A friend with us ordered half a grapefruit for breakfast and they brought her grapefruit juice instead.Overall, really great views, place was well kept and service was good. I'd go back to stay, but I wouldn't eat there.But, BEWARE.Not recommended. The facility is very nice, rustic, with nice features such as covered patio dining in the restaurant.  Room amenities are high quality and the rooms are spacious.  All in all our stay was a pleasant one for the wedding we attended down the road.However, at checkout the bill had extras tacked on for parking and wireless availability.  This was not for useage just for them being available.  I made a small fuss about these undisclosed extras but management acted as if this were the new normal.  Beware, add 20% to any rate that you think you are going to get for surprises when comparing hotels.I love the Poco Diablo!! We have stayed here multiple times and have been very pleased every time. Our last trip was Thanksgiving Holiday. We had a Poco king which has a King size bed, gas fireplace, sofa, chairs, large round table, mini fridge, and wonderful patio area that opens to the beautiful green grounds. There were a lot of families playing golf which was fun to watch.  We decided to open a bottle of wine and then remembered we didn't bring a cork screw or glasses (duh!). Called to the front desk and had it delivered to our room within 10mins. The guy even offered to open the bottle for us if we needed. I thought that was really sweet. Later that night we went thru the movie channels and although steep (19.00 a movie!) its all movies that haven't been released on DVD yet. I hit the wrong button and ordered a movie on accident. Another call to the desk and the movie was taken off our account, no questions asked, no big deal, done. The jetted tub was big enough for us both to enjoy a bubble bath together. Although it did take about 20mins to fill : /  in the end it was worth while. My only con is the restaurant on premise. We had a horrible experience dinning there for thanksgiving dinner. HORRIBLE. This is not our only bad experience with them. We made reservations for 5:00pm - we sat on the patio, it took 20 mins just to get our server to greet us! Fantastic, we are off to a great start! We ordered Prime Rib off there holiday menu. By the time the food arrived which was around 6:00pm I was ready to walk out. My prime rib was overcooked, tough, and all fat. Carrots looked dehydrated and like they had been sitting under a hot lamp far to long. They ran out of horseradish and said the cook was making more. It came out 12mins later once our food was completely cold. Our server never came back to ask how our food was.. Lucky her! She returned to tell us that, lucky us, all of the desserts had run out! AWESOME! No pumpkin pie on thanksgiving? Travesty. I requested our check. I just wanted out. Upon receiving our check I nearly choked. My husbands drink was 14.00!! For an old fashion! And they also took the liberty of adding on a 20% tip to our bill for the all time WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED IN A RESTAURANT?!?! This is when I lost it! Requested the manager immediately. He was flabbergasted by my prime rib, the amount of fat was ridiculous. He comped the entire meal and asked if we would like meals to go, which was a very nice gesture. He actually thanked us for complaining because ""if he doesn't hear WHY people are unhappy, he can't fix it."" . Upon leaving at 6:30pm! our Thanksgivinng meal had been destryoed.I'm stunned this Poco Diablo doesn't have more 5 star reviews.  I thought they did an excellent job, albeit a bit pricey.The service was excellent.  I'll give an extra thumbs up for Charles and William but all the staff were courteous and accommodating.   Staying there felt like a vacation and a home at the same time.They treat their dogs like kings (OK, slight exaggeration).   Dogs can stay there with an extra fee, get a bag of treats, and even a Do Not Disturb sign designed for dogs.  The staff loved to stop and say hello to the dogs.Food is good.  They have a restaurant (T Carls) that is a good bang for the buck.   Normally, I expect overpriced blandness at hotel-restaurants.   Hey, look, everyone, it's my first five star review on Yelp.  And it 's  well-deserved.   I've stayed two different times there and both times they did a superb job.We stayed at this hotel over New Year's eve. It was a decent hotel that has had some remodeling done to the suites, but I wouldn't go around town calling a resort...The rate we got wasn't the best for the type of hotel and had I checked other hotels I wouldn't have stayed there.On our last day there, there was a dead roach on the floor, when I mentioned it to the gal at the front desk upon checkout, she said that she wished I had told them before and that since I had pre-paid for my room there was nothing she could do.How about offering and apology and thanking me for letting her know, after all, I wasn't asking for a refund, in fact when I mentioned it to her, I did it in a very discrete fashion. She was silly enough to make a big deal for everyone in the lobby to know... I guess they need to train their staff a little better.The rooms were large and the beds were comfortable, the resort is pet friendly, but the best part was the stunning veiws!  For the price paid I thought is was very reasonable my only complaint would be the on site restaurant,  not very good at all.We got a great room with a jet hot tub  in the room! Sedona is beautiful and this resort is just as gorgeous.  I plan on having my wedding reception here. There is a restaurant and golf course here too.  They are pet friendly and have an area just for your pets.  I didn't bring my pet and from what I can tell,  there haven't been pets in this room.  The front desk was so nice to us when we checked in.  They even called a local shop to see how late they were open since we needed a bathing suit! They also gave us a map of sedona and drew a path of how to get there. The bed is so comfortable.  We ended up watching movies on the free HBO for a while since it was raining out.  It was so cozy. There is a fridge and an iron in the room and we ended up needing both.  I also really like that they give you bottled water along with coffee and other expected hotel amenities. One thing I like is that the wifi requires no password or extra steps to link up to. It's actually a strong signal , unlike the weak signals we normally get in hotels.   We'll definitely be staying here again!The Poco Diablo Resort is an older resort that's been rennovated, with comfortable &amp; good sized rooms. We attended a wedding here that was on the golf course under a huge weeping willow tree, the scene was beautiful.Our room was modern, with a nice bathroom &amp; plenty of room to get ready. The shower was a bit dark lighting wise, but other than that we definitely enjoyed our stay &amp; would return the next time we are in Sedona. For a little more than the motels down the street, it was a great value!","Poco Diablo Resort is a solid bet if staying in Sedona. I have my own reasons for giving it three stars, so I'll try to list out the goods and some drawbacks, below.The good: The resort is in Sedona, not too far from the action. The prices are reasonable, the grounds are beautiful and quiet, the WiFi is dependable, rooms are large and full of amenities, and the staff are very friendly.Needs improvement: The exterior look of the buildings could use some touching up. This place looks a little outdated. Also, the beds are the ""Sleep Number"" kind, but no matter what I did, I could find a comfortable setting. Finally, while the hotel is in Sedona and is peaceful, it still requires a drive to get pretty much anywhere. Overall, I am not sure if I would stay here again. I did book it through Hotwire, so I did not know what I would be getting in terms of the specific location. If I were to use Hotwire again and were matched to Poco Diablo, I wouldn't mind, but I think I would like to try other places if I did my own bookings next time.i don't even know where to begin with this hotel, spent $80 on a nye party ticket which was explained to me that there will be dinner included, which was not. charged me over$800 for pre authorization charges bc i made reservations with debit card that was not made aware to me. over charged me an extra $75 for the dog fee on top of the $100 i already paid.Great value and nice location.  It's within 10 mile proximity to the quaint Sedona Uptown and several famous attractions like Chapel of the Holy Cross, Bell Rock trail and the Airport Mesa vortex.  You can get a great view of the red rocks from the resort.  The facility is very clean and nice.  We really like the super King sized bed, firm mattress and the additional reading lights over the bed.  Room amenities are good quality.  We requested a quieter room and the receptionist gave us a great private, second floor location.  We paid through Priceline so no additional cost included.  Got free parking, complimentary bottled water and Wi-Fi in room.We plan on staying here again on our next trip to Sedona. We stayed there on a trip at the end of June. The price is excellent for the service and amenties. They have a decent gym, jacuzzi, pool and scenery. The service was beyond our expectations and the view,especially nearby mountains were jaw dropping. Right behind the hotel is Oak Creek. It was beautiful!! I got a great photo shots and enjoyed a small hike. The front desk provided us a map and pointed us towards Cathedral Rock for our first hike. It was so beautiful.  We are looking forward to staying at this hotel again.i've stayed here twice and no, its not five star, but its close enough to downtown sedona and yet far enough away to get a little of both worlds.  the rooms are HUGE and it feels remote and super dark....its peaceful like camping.  the brekky is decent but the gym is a little on the lower end though spacious.....it has tennis courts that i haven't used, but i did jog around adjoining neighborhoods which was niceWe had the pleasure of getting to stay at the Poco Diablo Resort just before our Fourth of July trip to Palm Desert.  We had a gift certificate for two nights stay.We got a nice room really close to the parking area, lobby, restaurant, pool/spa and workout facilities! Our balcony overlooked the ninth hole of their course.  Our room had two queen ""sleep number"" beds, very comfy, two sinks (very nice for the wife and daughter to get ready), flat screen tv, desk area and mini-fridge (it was roughly installed, but was cold).  the only thing we really missed from our room was a microwave.The pool and spa were really nice!  Several tables with cover and enough lounge chairs that several were always available.The workout facility was great!  It had free-weights, treadmill, elliptical, stair machine, steps and a multipurpose strength training machine.  There were plenty of towels and water to keep us on our workout schedule.  The best part for us, was the proximity of the workout facility to the pool, we were able to workout and watch our kids at the pool, win-win for us!We did have a good time at Poco Diablo, but there were some issue, the grounds around the pool needed a bit more attention.  Luckily we had already planned our weekend, the front desk didn't offer much in the way of recommendations.We didn't eat in the restaurant, but did have pool side service.  It was nice that a server came out to the pool area.  Our food arrived nice and quick, but without any condiments.  We survived, it was a vacation!Overall we recommend the Poco Diablo Resort, we had a really great time in Sedona and were able to get rested for the next day's events on those great Sleep Number beds!Location will be good again once the construction ends, but for now it's a royal pain to have all that noise and flag person in order to enter/exit the hotel.  Location is more run down from the outside than the inside.  I admit my first impression before entering the lobby was quite bad.  It's rather nice inside though, including the car and lounge area, as well as the mini golf course that the ""resort"" surrounds.Rooms were clean and somewhat small, but adequate.  Nice views of the fairways of the mini course, though you must know that one of the greens is at the end of the fairway right by the small parking lot, and they've clearly posted signs about parking at your own risk.  Also, the A/C is very, very slow in the rooms.Staff was very friendly.  Pool was decent, but not very inviting from first glance.  Selecting a room that faces the golf course would be highly preferable to one that faces the pool.Many ducks/geese on the facility so watch where you step.  Location is 5 minutes from the main downtown Sedona attractions.Was told it was built on a native burial ground?Hopi or yavapai?I loved this place! My BF, Puppy and I came up for a long weekend and enjoyed every moment of our stay! The rooms were clean, it was a dog friendly resort, the staff was so accommodating &amp; friendly. Its in a beautiful location &amp; the breakfast in their restaurant was delicious! I cant wait to come backThis place was very cool - able to get us in on a crowded holiday weekend last-minute in Sedona - and for cheap! We got a room with a jetted tub and gas fireplace for under 2 bills, and it sat right on the golf course. Tip: if you turn the tub jets on before the water level covers the spouts, you will spray a jet of water across the room. Try to get your gf/bf - it's so fun!The resort is beautiful and peaceful BUT the reason why I'm giving it 5 stars was because of the staff. Everyone that worked here was so nice and friendly and so accommodating. I had brought my dogs and they were so wonderful and sweet with my animals. I love pet friendly hotels and this place offers pet friendly dinning and menus for your pets as well as welcome gift bags for them. You also don't have to worry about house keeping letting your pets out accidently here, they have that covered too. I would love to stay here again and cant wait to go back to Sedona.I found this hotel to be a good value.  Our room was clean &amp; except for the carpet, the furnishings, bathroom fixtures, and bedding seemed relatively new.  The staff was wonderful, very accomodating.  The concierge, Gene, was prompt in responding to questions prior to our stay and making recommendations. We slept well, the bed was comfy and our room was quiet.  We were only there one night, so weren't able to use the golf course or dining room, but my son enjoyed the hot tub. The wi-fi was free and worked great.Other reviews, perhaps on another site, have made statements about added charges.  We didn't experience anything like that at all; the staff was great.And if you haven't been to Sedona, what an amazing place!  We hiked up Bell Rock (only need a $5 Red Rock pass to park near rocks, and there is a machine that dispenses the passes right in the lot!), visited the Chapel on the rock, airport mesa at sunset, Cathedral Rock, and I recommend that you try to drive north along Oak Creek Canyon for a bit...breathtaking.  We didn't have time to do a longer hike or jeep tour, but hope to visit again and do so.Not worth the price! I'll start by saying the staff is really really nice and the location and views are nice too.. Ok, now the issues:The room itself was ok. We had paid for a jacuzzi and fireplace upgrade for our anniversary. Unfortunately, the water temperate made any showering or relaxing in the jacuzzi impossible! It goes from scalding hot to cold and back again without even touching the dial! The tv only worked half the time and would cut in and out. The food in the restaurant is also BEYOND terrible. Every single thing about our order was wrong. Plus, when I ordered a pasta with a ""creamy tomato sauce"" , it came soaked in Alfredo with a few tomatoes in it! When I brought it to my servers attention, he brought me marinara to mix in with the alfredo sauce over my pasta (seriously!) We had also extended our stay by a day, and even though we let them know that at check-in, TWICE during a day of our stay, even though we had do not disturb on our door, they knocked and asked us when we are checking out that day.  Also, the neighbor next to us was smoking cigars on his patio the whole time so we couldn't even open our door to enjoy the scenery. The first time I called the desk, the employee said as long as they are outside there is nothing they could do about it. A few hours later, I go to the desk to speak with a manager and THEN am told, that they in fact are not allowed to smoke within 20 ft of a door.  Would have been nice to know before we had to hide in our room in Sedona all day and not see the views. The gym is also out of the 1970s. Not at all worth the price.I stayed at this hotel during the late summer of 2010 and I enjoyed the service from the staff.  They were very attentive and eager to help in any way that they can.  I think that the hotel is a bit dated, but the management has made a good attempt at staying current.  But there are some minor gaps in the overall delivery of the premise. I know price has a lot to do with experience, so I'll go over that.  I paid $124/night.  They had a little devil special that gives you a $30 breakfast coupon.  When I arrived, I was told that I had to buy the little devil special rate with is $28 more.  So I showed them their website and how it appears, and they happily obliged, acknowledging that their website is confusing.  No problem.  So, if the $124 with $30 breakfast credit was the deal, then I got a decent deal.  If it wasn't, then it's fair market value for the area.  Again, the staff are extremely helpful and are always trying to help.  I enjoyed their attentiveness.The room we received was updated.  Clearly, it is newer.  However, the sleep number beds seem to be a great idea, but it's a bit odd.  I'm not sure if I really like the bed.  It seems to be a nice bed, but you pump up the air in it with a remote control.  The thing is that my wife and I like to sleep on separate beds sometimes- like on this trip.  It gives us a little more freedom to move around in the bed while asleep.  But with the sleep number bed, you can feel the center where the two sleep number air bags meet.  It's not horrible, but I'm sure these beds were expensive and I'm not sure if they're more comfortable than a nice traditional mattress. Another thing that bothered me when I got to my room was the nightstand clearly had crumbs on it.  They looked like cookie crumbs or something, but it should have been wiped down before we got there.  Not a big deal, but it just shows a little lack of detail by the cleaning people.  The whole room is nice and updated, but we did have this old fridge which stuck out like swollen, sore thumb because the fridge looked like it was from the 80's.  My wife needed the fridge to store her breast milk for our baby.  The fridge works perfectly (and had it been in my home, I'd be hesitant to toss a perfectly functioning fridge).  But it did stick out.  All in all, I enjoyed the hotel for the price I received.  I know for the area, the hotels appear to be a bit older and pricier than, say Scottsdale, AZ.  But we're not in Scottsdale and Sedona is a lovely city.Booked one night for my girlfriend's birthday. I chose the room with the indoor jacuzzi (which is awesome by the way) and on top of it I ordered a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries (was a pleasant surprise for her).The golf course view was really good. There is a restaurant in the resort with a nice outdoorsy atmosphere but you can also choose to stay inside. The waitress was very friendly. We really enjoyed our stay there. It was also closer to the shopping areas and downtown. In some previous year we stayed at Diamond resort (which was really good by the way except for the timeshare pushing staff but I like PD better), and it was a little bit further away. Oh and the sleep number bed was fun and comfy. The fire place would've been romantic but it didn't work.Now what I didn't like. Most of the staff we met were extremely friendly including the guy who checked us in, but when I asked him one innocent question he got a little bit defensive and wouldn't give us a straight answer. Later thinking about it, we thought that he may have thought that we wanted to change the room and I understand how much of a hassle that could be for them but he could have handled it a little better especially that we had no intention to change the room. It was just a curious question in case we decide to come back again.Our room also had a fireplace which didn't work and the jacuzzi water wasn't very clean. Unfortunately we discovered that after the water has drained and we realized the black spots at the bottom. Yes we were bathing in this relatively dirty water.These are probably isolated incidents and I don't think they happen to everyone. I just wish that before handing the room to us they would have checked those things.When I mentioned that to the guy at the checkout desk he took off the champagne bottle extra from our bill, no questions asked. We felt that this was adequate compensation and were happy. It's more the attitude than the money. The fact is we weren't looking to take money off (yeah we're that nice), mentioned it casually since we thought it was an accident, but he redid the bill just to take this item off.I would definitely come back again, and I don't think those problem will happen again. It was just bad luck (or so I think .. haha).Here I am in Sedona, AZ, toiling away at work, attending and presenting at a conference. It's hard work, but someone has got to do it!9 hole golf course, lighted tennis courts, pool, jacuzzi in the nice AZ fall air with the bright moon sneaking in and out of the clouds, quiet and peaceful, no noise and hustle of the big city.Whew, this is hard work! People get jealous of my traveling, but hey, I have to drive for 2 hours from Phoenix, schlep luggage around, bring my computers....it's not that glamorous, I tell them!I didn't expect much from a Radisson Hotel, as they are not my first choice for lodging. But this place is pretty nice. Amidst the majestic red rock mesa and rock formations in this scenic canyon, this multi-terraced property has everything you could want, and at moderate prices. The rooms seemed to have been updated recently, as the decor is fresh and doesn't show signs of wear and tear. They are pretty good sized, too, with his and her robes, fridge, king size sleep number bed with dual spot reading lamps, tasteful dessert tones, 2 lounge chairs and an ottoman. There is even a back door hallway that can adjoin 4 rooms together into one big party room or family habitrail set-up!There is a restaurant on site (""T. Carl's""), and a bar with several large screen TVs. There also a few meeting rooms and a ballroom for a conference. Free Wi-fi, free local calls, unlimited incoming faxes, free parking, a pretty decent deal. Although I got a group rate, the price was reasonable, too.I'll have to come back again when i am not working so hard! Hehe!I had a bad experience.  After our stay, the GM settled with us.  All I can say if you are in your 20's or early 30's, this is not the place for you.  They don't want you there and you don't want to stay here.  I have also read and heard first hand of people getting extra charges after checkout.  Claiming they had a dirty room or some other pathetic excuse.  Of course you can't argue with them because you already checked out.Sleep number beds are also a joke.  It's an over sized air mattress.I really enjoyed my stay here at Poco Diablo.  We brought our two dogs and upon check-in, we received a little box with doggie treats, a plastic bone-shaped container and a water bowl which all came in handy because we forgot our doggie bowls at home, not to mention super nice and thoughtful of the hotel (although they do charge a $25 fee per dog / stay, not per night).  The room was nicely remodeled, beds were comfy with super clean white sheets, there is a mini fridge and our room came with a jet tub, free Wi-Fi.  The air conditioning is a bit loud, but that did not bother me much.Restaurant not good at all, resort staff is hit and miss, if you stay here definitely go somewhere else for food!My son's wedding was held there, we were very happy with the resort.  The staff bent over backwards to help us.  We had handicapped members of our wedding party and they provided golf carts to transport our guest.  They had pet sitting for a golden retriever puppy.  All of our needs were addressed.  The resort is older but it is in excellent condition and well maintained.  The wedding package was the best value we found in Sedona.","Stayed at Poco Diablo Resort for my one year wedding anniversary. Room was great restaurant was a big disappointment. I am the assistant GM of a restaurant in flagstaff and We decided to try T. Carls because it was right there and didn't want to drive into town for dinner. We got to the restaurant and waited at the host stand for around ten minutes without anyone acknowledging us. At that point we decided to try the bar. I mentioned that it was our one year anniversary to the server and sat down and ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. The server came back with a bottle of wine started opening it until I stopped him to let him know that this was not the bottle of wine that I ordered. He explained that he just grabbed a bottle of Pinot Noir. He brought back the correct bottle of wine and poured it for us. We then ordered food. As the server was putting it in my wife and I talked about it and decided that this was not a very good place to enjoy our one year anniversary dinner. I went to the server and asked him to cancel our order and we wanted our bill for the wine. The server did not care that we were leaving. Didn't ask about us leaving just said ok. If this happened in my restaurant someone would have got a serious talking to. I would give the hotel 4 stars but the restaurant service was really bad so overall they get one star. Probably won't go back.AWESOME!!!The only gripe about this hotel would be getting there, due to construction on the main highway, but it would not count against the the hotel, other than that grade A.Initially we were setup a standard room, but the wonderful girl at the front desk upgraded our room to the Suite knowing this was the first time being in Sedona. Huge room, Jacuzzi, Fireplace, Refrigerator and all other inclusive ammenities. The back has a patio that leads to the beautiful garden where squares and ducks freely roam around. Had some bread so I started feeding the ducks, before I knew I had 25 ducks near the room 'Oh Shit!' It was cool, throw some bread and these ducks literally catch them, let me say, there impatient because one little son-of-a-bitch bit me because I did not toss the bread to him. lolAll in All, beautiful and relaxing establishment. Must recommend. Oh yeah, free Wi-FiI expected a lot out of this resort. The pictures on the internet were nice, and its a Radisson so you would think it would be nice. We stayed in one of the suites that had a fireplace and jacuzzi tub in the room. The fireplace is a gas one that you flip a switch and its supposed to light. Ours didn't work :( Also, either the last person who stayed in the room before us OR the cleaning crew found it funny to point all the jets in the tub upward...So when I was leaning over the tub getting it all set up, the hubs flipped the switch and I got sprayed, make that doused with water, our room got sprayed and the floors were soaked. Not cool. They have sleep number beds in the rooms. It was my first time sleeping on one and it was one of the worst night sleeps I have ever had, super uncomfortable. When we came back to the room after getting engaged the hubs went up to the front desk and asked for a wine opener...he was given the run around and finally after 20 minutes or so the staff was able to round up a disposable wine opener after giving much grief to the hubs. They did take care of us at check out which was nice, but the whole experience just wasn't great.We stayed for one night and had terrible service from the front desk staff and had a bug alive in the bed.  This was not worth the $180.00 we paid to stay there.  On a positive note, the room service was fast.I absolutely LOVED this place!  I went for an alternative (gay) wedding and was treated so lovely by the entire staff.  Everyone is polite and they chef is MAGNIFICENT!!!  I don't play  golf, but I love to relax and I highly recommend this resort if you are in or near Sedona!The staff rules!  Jan was so nice and helpful.  She is awesome.I wasn't expecting much but this place was really clean, spacious and great.  Didn't enjoy the sleep number bed though. I'd come back again.Great experience at this beautiful hotel/resort in gorgeous Sedona!  First of all, we booked online (through American Express travels) for $134/night in July 2010.  Our plans changed and we arrived one day early -- and the staff offered us a walk-in rate of $119/night for the extra night we stayed AND gave us a free upgrade to their king suite!  The suite was gorgeous with a high vaulted ceiling, small patio overlooking the beautifully landscaped par-3 golf course, and jacuzzi tub. The resort offered a lot of amenities (fitness center, pool, spa, tennis courts) which we didn't have time to use.  Their restaurant, notably, offers food until 11pm, which was later than the vast majority of the restaurants in the Sedona downtown area.  The staff was super friendly and extra helpful.  The front desk person (was it Jan?) who gave us the free upgrade also gave us some maps of the area and pointed out the good places to eat and the popular trails to hike.  Very attentive!Just note that this resort is a few miles south of the downtown Sedona area, but not inconvenient to get to despite the construction on Hwy 179. Excellent experience for a great price (for this upscale touristy town)!   Would recommend and would stay again!Beautiful views, quiet, comfortable and affordable. They offer all the amenities you need a pool, small gym, golf course, and tennis courts round out the offering. While it is close to the highway (the tennis courts are right on top of it) it was remarkably well insulated and the proximity went unnoticed from my room. The concierge staff was helpful, knowledgeable and cheerful making great recommendations and setting up excursions for us. A stones throw from downtown and the beautiful views of Sedona coupled with the comfort and affordability make this hotel a great stay.its a quiet remote place for locals like me and I always enjoy going for the excellent service, sometimes the food is not quite up to par, but they try very hard. I really like the people the best.This is only for the restaraunt...NOT the hotel.  The hotel was average. Here is how the story goes...Once upon a time I woke up in the Poco Diablo hotel on vacation in Sedona Arizona, very hungry. I thought...I want a nice breakfast, attentive service, possible view to enjoy gentle conversation without being overheard from other patrons and not overly pricy! I want to eat something very yummy and a waiter who can deliver a fantastic latte to my liking! After much reviewing online I decided to give the Hotels restaurant a try as we had a coupon for 20%off. I walked up holding my breath hoping to see other people as you all know that if it is empty that is NOT a good sign...the patio to my liking was PACKED. ; ) We were greeted by a smiling individual who was kind and attentive and later I found out he was Charles McIntosh the restaurant manager!! He asked us for our drink need then sat us to be served under the care of Jose Mendoza. Very quickly after that he hand delivered the most BEAUTIFUL presentation of a layered latte I have ever seen. I was delighted and asked for another in which he prepared side table to show me exactly how it was done. I will be forever grateful for this as I love my coffee. Jose took our order and we were served in an expedient manner getting everything exact. My son and I are the particular ones and wanted special orders and my less maintenance husband ordered basic eggs and sausage. It was surprisingly inexpensive and the presentation pleasing. These two individuals must be recognized they are 5 STARS at best! The end.Your average room, decor and resort. Nothing to be impressed about- rooms are tiny, old, Golf course is rather small, no real landscaping around.Service was exceptional! We were greeted by a funny, sweet woman who upgraded our room and sent us a bottle of champagne. She also gave great tips for making the most of our only day in Sedona. She suggested a late check-out to give us the most flexibility. It was wonderful!. The service the next morning was equally as great. The restaurant sent us on our way with free coffee to go and  the concierge  was very helpful. The rooms show minor signs of wear and tear but the service and the price more than made up for that. Beautiful grounds!My husband and I stayed here for one night last weekend. I found this place after a lot of searching because I wanted a room with a jacuzzi tub and fireplace. The value was good, compared to the prices of the other hotels/B&amp;Bs in the area. Poco Diablo is located in Oak Creek--great location, just a short drive into town, and very pretty. We booked an Elite Spa room, with a King size bed (Sleep Number--we were pretty ambivalent about the bed though others swear by it, but it was comfortable), jacuzzi tub and fireplace. The fire place is gas and has a little light switch that you flip. Kind of hokey, but nice once it was fully lit. The tub was a nice touch. But, like another reviewer mentioned, the jets were pointed upwards (or we didn't have the tub filled with enough water, not sure which!) and we ended shooting water all over the wall, floor, in our wine glasses...everywhere! I should mention that the tub is next to the nightstand, so it's pretty much in your living space. The room itself is spacious and nice. The bathroom was great, very large, and had a separate sink outside it with a mirror. Plenty of room to get ready without taking over the bathroom. Overall, I would stay here again. I'm a very picky person so I don't know that (short of spending $500+ a night) I would be perfectly satisfied with any hotel. But it was nice, the front desk was helpful, location great, gorgeous area, and clean. If you are looking for good places to eat, go to Open Range (Chicken Taco salad AMAZING!) or Orchards Inn (get the green corn and chicken tamales, they are great!)first of all, i would like to say that this radisson booked our hotel room as we were driving from the grand canyon or something ridiculous, at like 10pm. amazing! so nice! our room was a good size, with an enormous spa bath in the bedroom. awkward? a little. but believe i was in that sucker the minute my bags were down! we couldn't figure out the ac at first, but the people at the front desk were helpful when we called to clarify. the ac ended up being ok, not good enough considering it was 90 degrees outside even at 11pm. the bed was enormous and super comfy! the staff was also helpful in explaining the red rocks-where to go, what to look for, what they're all about, etc. it was great to get the info even though i kind of think that stuff is a sham.all in all a good experience!A nice place to stay- beds were very comfortable and room was moderately priced.  This is only a 3 star as there is no complimentary coffee or continental breakfast.  We did eat in the restaurant for breakfast only because it was convenient.  Food was fair and I feel expensive for the quality- typical hotel food!  The one thing that really irritated me, was that our reservation was for the Raddison- between my reservation and our arrival (about 8 days), the hotel transitioned and was not a Raddison any more.  We drove up and down the highway looking for the Raddison.  I finally called the hotel from the car and was told, the Raddison sign had been turned off and to look for Poco Diablo.  Would have been nice to have been informed before spending 40 minutes looking for the hotel.  This will not be a problem for anyone arriving now, but I was so irritated, I just needed to write about it.  Location is good- nice and quiet, away from all the touristy areas. I would stay here again, but bring my own yogurt and bagels.","['place', 'well', 'kept', 'customer', 'service', 'fantastic', 'dog', 'friendly', 'well', 'gave', 'doggy', 'little', 'welcome', 'bag',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sedona-motel-sedona,Sedona Motel,4.5,$,46,"Believe the hype. Affordable by Sedona standards (we paid $135 per night on a weekend), rooms are large clean and modern. Very central, two great restaurants across the street and a touristy cluster of galleries down the street.The person at the desk was Bill, and he was helpful and friendly. For the money, you'll do no better in Sedona.Okay, so I gotta be honest.  Based on the overall experience, I would have given this place 4 stars, maybe 4.5.  But when you factor in the low price I a high-cost tourist destination, it totally rises to 5 stars.  You absolutely can't beat a room in the heart of Uptown Sedona for $120 a night!!The owner was incredibly nice and helpful. He gave us maps and recommendations on where to go in town.  The rooms were super clean and had the amenities you need.  Our one gripe was with the bed.  Not only was the mattress itself not great (thin and hard) but the sheets were terrible quality. My husband would tell you that I'm a snob about sheets but the ones in the motel were not up to par,  they were scratchy and it kept me up much of the night. Other reviewers have commented on noise....we didn't find that at all,  it was quiet all night and early morning.  The views from the motel are killer and the location can't be beat.  If you want luxury, this isn't for you, but if you want a phenomenal value, definitely stay here.This was a great yelp find! The hubs and I stayed here for just one night but found the room to be clean and the owner very friendly. He gave us great suggestions on where to go around Sedona to see great views of the stunning landscape. And the bed was super comfortable for us. We both slept really well; the best on our trip. And the views outside the motel were spectacular. Definitely recommend staying here while in Sedona.Great views and awesome service.  Second time here and both times Don helped us out and was the one to check in.  He gave us a map, told is where the tourist attractions are, and let us know where the best places in town are. We will definitely stay here again.The best place to stay in the red rocks. Over the years, Ive stayed at much more expensive places in Sedona, but I have not stayed at any better for the price.Very clean and quite, well appointed rooms with comfortable sleeping, an in the middle of town location, with easy access, convenient parking and a friendly staff, this little motel is hard to beat.This is a true old style motor inn motel and at around 100$ a night (a little less in the off season) by Sedona standards is on the inexpensive side by comparison. As this is a market where you can easily spend in excess of 200$ a night.Like I said, you can stay at much more expensive places in town but why... This cool little motel offers one of the more pleasant stays around, and is way more relaxed and unpretentious than most of the lodging places in the red rocks. A solid 4.5 stars. Rounded up for being the cool place that it is.00226I loved staying at this place. It's very clean, organized, close to everything, and among the cheapest place to stay in Sedona. Hell, it might be the cheapest. During my Sedona trip, I was out exploring all day and just needed a basic room with a nice bed to sleep at night. Bummed this place is already booked for my upcoming Sedona trip. I recommend it fully.This was such a great choice for our nights stay in Sedona. It was the perfect distance from restaurants but not TOO close to the super packed town center. We walked across the street for lunch and tea. The location was perfect. Right in the middle of the most scenic part of sedona. The room was very clean and adequately heated in 20-30 degree winter weather. Appears to be locally run by some very nice people. I think our 1Q room was around $150.Went to Sedona for the first time for Memorial Day with my wife..or first overnight trip away from our one year old.After looking at prices for the holiday I was apprehensive because we just wanted a bed and a shower as we were going hiking and off roading. Well lucky us we found this place! First of all it was wayyy nicer than I expected. The owner is one of the nicest people I've dealt with in a long time. And the views from this place are amazing! It's a gem. Definitely recommendThis motel is amazing! It's clean and inexpensive and right in the heart of Sedona. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly and our stay here was very enjoyable. I will definitely stay here again!Location, location, location! Located next to the shops at the Hyatt resort. This motel is clean, reasonable priced, and good costumer service. The owners are very knowledgeable of the area, gave us great tips. The rooms were well equipped with Safe, TV, Microwave, Fridge, Coffee Pot, Coffee, hair dryer, Iron and Board. Free wifi. Check in 3 pm and check out 10 am. No online reservation. Beds could be better. No shampoo and conditioner. However, did have organic soap. No pool. Wifi was slow. And no breakfast but plenty of choices nearby. We just wanted a place to sleep and shower to enjoy hiking in Sedona, Grand Canyon and Antelope canyon. We were skeptical with the ""motel"" but after arrival we weren't disappointed. We will definitely come back.I've stayed here twice now. Once a couple years back and then last night. Clean, modern and quit. Very friendly and helpful host. No pool, but you didn't come to Sedona to swim ;) You'll be in the heart of old town Sedona. Every single room has a view!I have been around and coming to Sedona for a long time.  This is why you come to Sedona, relax, small local business owned by local residents, location, clean and comfy.  Stayed two nights and all was well. Bring your own stash of hotel shampoo but all else is here. Price is around $100 more or less but cheap for Sedona. I posted a couple photos, 30, 31, check the view from the from.Booked this place online at the last minute because it had good reviews, was cheap, and had a vacancy.  It's an old motel but very clean.  It reminded me of motels we used to stay in when I was a girl and they didn't have all the chain motels.  The only thing missing was that the bed didn't have a slot to put a quarter in!  That was a biggy when I was little,lol.The mgr. couldn't have been nicer and very knowledgeable and helpful of what to do.  Highly, recommend, especially if you like quaint and aren't really going to spend a lot of time in your room.  Very convenient to things to do.Such a lovely place to stay in Sedona.Bill at the front counter is just great. As soon as we arrived he gave us a map and great advice about where to go. The room and bed were extremely comfortable everything perfect in the room. The motel is set back a bit from the main road so you can hear the traffic but it doesn't affect the quality of your stay. It's the view that really blows you away- it's something else. This really is an awesome place to stay and you won't meet a nicer person than Bill.2nd time I stay here. 1st time was great--great value for price. Not a 5star chain but great basic room. 2nd time a/c went out. Host is always pleasant and helpful. Brought in a portable unit. Worked ok but very very loud--didn't allow for much rest. Coupled with a higher price made this stay feel like I should have looked around. Still recommend but I'll look around next time. Host and hospitality still gets 5 stars.We stayed here recently on our way to the Grand Canyon, and I would definitely recommend this place.   They don't do reservations online, so you'll have to give them a call.   They have a great location that is within walking distance of shops and restaurants, and a great view on their patio.   The owner was super nice and really wanted to make sure we enjoyed our time here.All-in-all, a good value for the money.  Conveniently located, great view from your room, and a nice covered patio.  Staff was helpful.  Parking in front of your room.  HVAC was good, bed was comfortable, cable and TV were good, and internet was good.  Only complaint was the lack of a comfortable sitting area in the room - two chairs with no arms and a small, short, round table.  A taller and larger table would have given you a desk for the laptop and for writing.  Not sure if would stay again unless I was only there while sleeping.Exceeds expectations! Big Bang for your buck!!!! Rooms are clean, comfortable and modern. AC and wifi!!!! Patio with great views!!! Why pay more?!?!?!  Owner is nice and helpful.Have to concur with the reviews above. Clean, beautiful rooms, friendly, helpful owner.  I don't know why you'd want to stay anywhere else. This is a gem!  Not what you'd think in a motel!The Sedona Motel is a beautiful place to stay in the heart of scenic Sedona, AZ. Staff and management are friendly and helpful. They really made me feel safe and at home on my first solo trip. The rooms are clean and beautifully arranged, and this location is close to everything you will want to do when you visit. Enjoy!!!","A bit nervous when I booked this  ""motel"" for our Sedona vacation but the location and price were so good I wanted to give it a try.  Firstly, set aside the word ""motel"" since this place is nicer than most of the hotels I have been to.  Suspect fairly recent renovation since everything seems on the new side and immaculately clean.  Flat screen TV (with HBO) fridge, microwave and coffee pot with GOOD coffee make this place just awesome.  Loved grabbing a cup then setting in their patio area with the awesome views while my spouse slept a bit longer.About a 10 minute walk to the main part of town which will save you a ton of time and frustration trying to find parking (trust me, don't even try it).  BBQ place next door is the best you will ever have!No pool so no noisy kids, no smoking anywhere-LOVED THAT! Close to the road but since Sedona basically closes at 8PM it becomes silent from 9ish to 6ish and even then it's not super loud.Note* no shampoo so bring your own but other than that everything you need is there and you really can't beat the price.  Highly recommend this place to anyone.This is a great budget-friendly motel just a few blocks away from the annoying touristy bustle of the main drag in Sedona. It has GREAT views from all the rooms, overlooking the red rocks. There is a small lovely patio area where you can watch the sunrises/sunsets with your coffee or wine. The wifi is great (fast, strong connection), the rooms and bathrooms are spacious and very clean. The motel faces the street, but Sedona completely shuts down by 11pm and so it's pretty quiet. This motel was the opposite of impersonal chain hotels. The proprietor was so friendly and welcoming and even lent my husband and I the use of his own personal hiking guide books and his national park pass. He was full of great hiking information and restaurant suggestions. I will definitely stay here should I find myself in Sedona again.I found The Sedona Motel by Googling best hotels in Sedona.  If you want a great location, a clean and comfortable room, which includes a refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave, all at a VERY reasonable price, this motel is for you!  The grounds are also in great shape, Bill, one of the owners is great and very friendly.  They also have a covered patio with a fabulous view of the red rocks, a fun spot to sit at any time of the day and enjoy the view.  Creekside restaurant is right across the street, we only were able to try breakfast and it was wonderful, plus another nice view as we dined.  We highly recommend The Sedona Motel and plan on staying there, the next time we visit.I had read the reviews on Yelp so my husband and I were hoping for the best. The best it was. The proprietor was very accommodating as we had to rearrange our trip more than once. Our room was huge and the bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was large and well lit. We had a covered carport which was great as it rained. We loved the area and found really good dining options across the street. I'm sure the resorts are fabulous but we really enjoyed the Sedona Motel. I cant imagine why we would stay anywhere else.You don't have to be rich to enjoy a good night's rest in a quiet, clean room in Sedona proper.  Staying at the Sedona Motel proved it.  It wasn't fancy, but for $110/night, we had a good sized room with a refrigerator, microwave oven, flat screen TV, free wifi, a coffee pot and coffee.  The front desk clerk (who also lives on the property) was knowledgeable, friendly and informative.  A hot shower after a long hike, and we were in heaven.  We will be back, and we will stay here.We absolutely loved this place!Clean, cute, gorgeous view very reasonably priced and very centrally located downtown. The owner (Bill) was available 24/7 for any questions we had. He even loaned us a few hiking books and gave us his recommendations which was soooooo helpful. He also pointed out a few great resturants for us which we went to and loved! Would definitely stay here again, great experience all around.This is the place to stay if you are visiting Sedona on a budget.  It was the cheepest place we could find, and right in the middle of the town.  The views are spectacular right from the room windows and the place was VERY clean.  There is also a great outdoor spot to enjoy your morning coffee and watch the sun come up over the mountains!  The owner  (who also was working the front desk) was one the most friendly, helpful, and knowledgable people we met in the area.  Next stay for us will be the Sedona Motel for sure.This place is great!! There so much within walking distance and very close to the Main Street with all the little shops. The dude at the main desk is extremely help and will get you an info you need about Sedona and surrounding areas. From maps to menus for dinning to loco hang out, so you don't have to do the tourist thing which I can only do for so long. Anyway, great place to stay!The Good:  Very clean and convenient location.  TV was fine, free wifi,  and the room was pretty comfortable with nice views.   The man at the desk was very cordial with a low soft voice that reminded us of a psychologist.  The price was lower than most in the area.  The Bad:  Neither of us slept.  The bed mattress was about 4 inches thick and when you laid on it, you felt as though you were lying on the springs.  I always carry a very thick foam topper with me so that helped some.  But even with that, I was so uncomfortable it was just useless.  Hubby likes firm mattresses but he awoke after a couple hours complaining about pain in his hips from the mattress.  We had hoped to get eight hours and go out for a day of sightseeing and hiking. But after only about four hours, we drove around and tried walking but no way.  We gave up and drove home, completely exhausted.I realize there are a lot of folks who don't mind the mattress issue and if that's the case, it's a great place to stay.  But for us (late forties btw) we won't be back unless the mattresses are upgraded.My first motel experience was surprisingly great. My motel room 35 was clean, free ice and WiFi. Bill and Don are always there so you can ask them anything about Sedona.  The location of the motel is perfect just near the ""Y"" so you can go uptown or west Sedona easy. I'll definitely stay here again when I'm in Sedona!If you're looking for a place to stay while you're visiting Sedona, you know that there are lots of fancy hotels around town.  Forget about them.Look at it like this:  Take an older, cheap motel.  Revamp the whole place so that each room has a nice bed, nice furnishings, a small fridge and microwave, and maintain it well so that it is absolutely sparkling clean.  That's the Sedona Motel.  It doesn't have those pain in the ass electronic door locks, but the analog pin card keys work just fine.  Sedona doesn't offer 3G service for iPhones, but there is wifi here.  Service is provided by a very friendly gentleman in the office, and you get the ""cheap motel price"" for a little place that is just full of awesome.No, nothing fancy here at all--don't expect lotions and potions and a complementary hairnet in the bathroom--you get SOAP.  Spartan Luxury, to coin a phrase.  This is the best lodging deal in Sedona, you get great, kind service, and you get it all for a song.Booked this motel at the last minute and had no idea what to expect.All expectations were met and exceeded.I was online searching for Sedona accommodation and came across this motel. Unfortunately there is no online reservations, so you need to call and the proprietor calls you back. I was skeptical.....until he called back within the hour. ""Bill"" who's deep calm voice wins you over before you hand over your cc info was lovely. $120 for 4 of us in a double room with no extra charge for a cot. Best deal in Sedona!The location is central and ideal. Right across from Ken's (best peach crumble in the world), a bottle shop and pizza. Just the right walking distance from uptown Sedona. The room was spotless and looked recently renovated. Microwave, fridge and coffee pot were on hand. Oh....did I mention free wifi!This place is a MUST for convenient, value for money.Go see BILL!!!!We booked here based on reading reviews online and it held up to its reviews and more.Booked for one night but added a second night when we arrived and saw the view from the motel .Bill is a wonderful host , gave us great tips on things to do and places to eat , everywhere he told us about was top notch ... He is a very laid back and pleasant person. The room was extremely clean !! Best nites sleep on my vacation , town gets very quiet and no worries over safety , felt very safe.Great price for a room with this view , located pretty close to everything.Take away the Frou-Frou, the lavender-scented toenail lotion, the 400 channel, air-conditioned TV; but keep the comfortable bed, thick bath towels, tasteful furniture and artwork, and genial host. Sum the two parts and you have exceptionally good value for your dollar.Now tour Sedona or Oak Creek in peace, knowing there's no better place to stay.Second time staying in the King Suite (sits just behind the main building)... can't beat it for the price! Great central location too! Don't get me started on the view out the front window as I write this...This is a diamond in the rough.  I know that the word ""MOTEL"" immediately brings all sorts of unsavory thoughts in a weary traveler's mind.  However, I read amazing reviews on another travel site about The Sedona Motel.We had never been to Sedona and upon driving onto Highway 179 we were floored at the rocks immediately.  As we drove into the heart of the town and past Tlaquepaque, perched at the top of the hill, across from Snoopy Rock was this cute little place.Clean.  Functional.  Central locale.  Budget Friendly.  Gorgeous Views!Not for high maintenance folks.  No mini bottles of shampoo, conditioner, lotion or shower caps.  No gym or spa.  Just the basics.  The biggest plus, was Bill, who checked us in and gave us a rundown on the best of Sedona.  We were given a map and orientation which was incredibly helpful for first time visitors.  I would recommend the Sedona Motel to anyone who asked and I look forward to staying there again on my next visit!What an accommodating motel in the midst of over priced resort in the scenic sedona, az. The manager gave me the grand tour and was super friendly, the beds were soft but comfy. the rooms (we had the 1 bedroom units in the back) were kept tidy and clean. I just can't say enough about this place.. WILL be coming back and staying here again..The location cannot be beat.  The man who runs the office (owner?)  was super friendly and helpful.  The price for what you're getting is amazing.  The beds were comfortable.  It was quiet at night, even being near the gorgeous patio.  The housekeeping staff did a great job.  There was a small empty fridge that we were able to use for yogurt and beverages to save us some breakfast money.  I also noticed they had a safe.  I had not a single complaint and would not hesitate to stay here again when I make it back to Sedona.Great location.  Very clean!  Very excellent value for the money.  Liked the covered deck that afforded a great place to sit and relax.  Wonderful man at the check in desk was very personable.  Only issues is that it was too easy to hear other guests and the shower head left much to be desired as it was more of an uneven trickle, but at least the temperature was good.  I travel a great deal, and this was the best drive up to the door motel I ever stayed.  Refrigerator and microwave were a perfect touch.  The bed was what I needed, and I felt very safe.  Make a reservation as I was glad I had because they had NO vacancy sign lit up when I pulled in at 6 pm.Just stayed at the Sedona Motel and I agree with the other reviews that its not the place to stay if you are high maintenance. Since we are not, it was fabulous for us. If you are going to Sedona to hike, dine out, and enjoy nature, then this place is perfect! Very basic but also very CLEAN. I also really enjoyed the hospitality of the owner who welcomed us graciously and recommended several great things to get us started on our trip.There is also a large common area with several tables and chairs where you can eat and relax and take in beautiful views of the red rocks; it's also a nice place to meet fellow travelers staying at the motel. Parking is also great- you park directly in front of your room. I'm giving this 5 stars because this is definitely as good as it gets at this price point! Great value for your money.","Convenient, newly refurbished, fabulous host.We were looking to spend 2 nights in Sedona and didn't want luxury but wanted clean, convenient and not expensive. We looked to Yelp and read reviews of the Sedona motel. We called and made a reservation and then drove 2 hours from Mesa. We found it easily - it is right on the main highway. Parking lot is easy, you park right in front of your room. I had mobility issues at the time we went so that was important to me.  We met Bill at the front desk and he lived up to his Yelp reputation. He was friendly, knowledgeable and was used to talking to people who have never been to Sedona. He gave us recommendations for restaurants and activities. We went to find our room and were pleasantly surprised. It was newly refurbished with a flat screen TV and nice bathroom. It was very clean too. Happy!The only things that were not a ""10"" were the king size bed was not as firm as I like (used to higher end hotels like Hilton, I guess) and the noise from the highway and the motel parking lot outside the door was surprising - not sure what the motel can do about that. If you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs! The customers like to stand by their cars or motorcycles and talk. There is a liquor store right across the highway and a great restaurant called Ken's Creekside. I highly recommend the motel and Ken's Creekside. In Oct, we paid $120 a night for a king bedroom with tax.  Bill was very up front that the tax is high in Sedona for tourists so don't be surprised!I hate to break the string of 5 star ratings here, but I just cannot justify that many stars for this property.  Yes, it is clean, convenient and a good value, but the same can be said for the La Quinta Inn Sedona/Village of Oak Creek, where I am currently staying.  The price point is about the same for both properties, but at La Quinta you get a free breakfast.  If you must be in/near Uptown Sedona, then the Sedona Motel has that advantage.One criticism I do have about this hotel is regarding street noise, especially in the morning.  All of the rooms face the main road, Hwy. 179.  It is not well insulated for noise.  If you are the type of person who enjoys sleeping in, you might want to pack some ear plugs; beginning as early as 5 AM, I could hear the noise of trucks lumbering up the hill on 179 north.  This was not a steady stream of traffic at this hour, but it did become more noticeable approaching the 7 O'clock hour.  Other observations:  the furnishings were dated, but all in good working order.  The rooms were clean.  The owner is very friendly, accommodating and helpful, as other reviewers have noted.  If this is your first visit to Sedona/Red Rocks Country, his insight and assistance will be helpful.  Sedona Motel is within walking distance of Uptown Sedona shopping &amp; dining.  It is just a short distance downhill to the Tlaquepaque Shopping area.  There is even a trail head within walking distance, for those interested in a hike.Yes, I would stay here again! Heres the thing, average rooms but right in the heart of Sedona. Next door to Tlackapaque (ok who can spell that?) And yes, the owner was simply put, a really cool guy. He suggested a few places to eat, and really helpful about everything in general. You can step outside your room and see beautiful views, and there is a patio at the end with breathtaking views. Room had a fridge and microwave. Good shower, average motel bed. Sedona is pricey so for $100 a night we were quite happy.I wanna give this 3 stars because while the location was perfect, I'm pretty sure there were bedbugs in the bedroom.  At the very least, the room wasn't inviting, and all I ask for in a room is a bed and restroom, no bells and whistles.  But we heard the cars on the main road easily, the AC was extremely loud, and the bedsheets needed to be washed in our opinion.  The views were nice and the owner/manager was extremely nice, helpful, and knowledgable about the area, but the room itself was nothing special, even for a motelThe location is great - gorgeous views right infront of you!  Rooms are simple, but clean.  Beds are decent - it's a motel - won't say that they are the best I've ever slept on.  The owner, Bill, is super nice and helpful.  If you can't afford to stay at some fancy hotel, come to Sedona Motel.  I'd say this is one of the nicer motels I've ever stayed at.Great Hotel!!!! The room's are clean and if you're coming to Sedona to see the outdoors and don't  plan on being at a hotel/motel except to sleep and shower then I recommend this place. Note: bring the following because it's not supplied in the rooms: Shampoo.  If you have a problem with it not having Shampoo then I will sell you all the $100 mini-shampoo bottles you want because that's the difference between this place and the next closest priced motel in the area. The owner is very nice and is usually working the front desk. He is very very helpful in suggesting places to see or visit and overall a really good guy. He also gave me a few books about Sedona and the Vortexes to read over while I was stayed here as I wanted to learn more about the area since this was my first visit. I was driving through the area around 9:30pm New Years Eve and he was closing down for the night and opened the door for me and said no problem at all and then proceeded to answer the 100 questions I had about the area, the vortexes, where to eat, have a drink. It's feels more like a mom and pop place vs the larger chains. No you don't get the spa treatments or continental breakfast but seriously if you want that then plan on paying a minimum of $100 more at any other hotel/motel in town or instead go to a place an eat breakfast which will save you beau coop bucks. I for one will be staying here again in a few months when I come back with my friends from San Diego.  The rooms range from $79/night  to approx $120/night for a suite. I promise you're not going to find a better deal because believe me I checked!!  I would also recommend calling ahead to reserve because he said he is usually booked solid for weeks in advance. I gave the Sedona Motel one $ because it's the cheapest around and 5 stars because for the money you cannot beat it and the rooms are very clean and the owner is more than helpful with all aspects of my stay and answering my questions. Enjoy your time in Sedona and the Sedona Motel.",,,"['believe', 'hype', 'affordable', 'standards', 'paid', '135', 'per', 'night', 'weekend', 'rooms', 'large', 'clean', 'modern', 'central', 'great',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/a-sunset-chateau-sedona,A Sunset Chateau,4.5,$$$,44,"Phil and Janet, the owners, run a great Bed and Breakfast. Their establishment literally transforms you to seclusion to enjoy the views. They serve a to die for breakfast made by their son and Phil is a seasoned chef as we dined on eggs florentine today. We unfortunately had a flat tire. Not only did Phil hear out my problem, he drove me personally to his friends auto shop to get a compressor to bring back because it was a holiday weekend and all the tire shops were closed. He made breakfast for the mechanic for helping me out. This was on a Sunday mind you during Labor Day. The accommodations for their rooms were unbelievable. They were open, yet had their privacy. This isn't a put together by budget room, couch or bed. It had furniture in there you'd want in your home. Customer service is a lost art, but not by these owners. I will be writing a positive review for the mechanic that helped me out as well. Thanks for making us look forward to our next vacation here, we will be loyal to the Chateaux!Way too expensive for the room or service.  It was Valentine weekend and we should have booked ahead but I was trying to surprise my bf with a last minute trip to Sedona (he had never been).  When booking I inquired if they give any discounts for AAA or  Military veterans.. They gave us 7% off so the base rate was $279, (which is still the most I have ever spent on a hotel room).  Last year alone (2014) I have stayed 30 plus days in Sedona and never paid that much or been treated so poorly.  Real Bummer.When we checked in (no one was there for 5 mins), the gentlemen arrived spoke to my bf not me which was odd since it was my booking and I was paying. He told him while I was using the restroom that we should have called?  Why should we have called?The room was ok, the electric fireplace is really tacky.  Scratches on the wall and the outdoor lounge chairs looked like someone just got out of them complete with nice dirty butt prints.  My biggest issue is that they are constructing 2 more suites right adjacent to our suite and the construction began before 9 am so we couldnt even relax in for a bit.  I would NOT have booked the room had I known that fact.  (the grounds are obstructed by the construction too, so you cannot enjoy them as well either)Breakfast was crap.  A small bowl of fruit with melon, orange juice from concentrate?  I can get better at the Days Inn.  We asked the kitchen if I could just have a piece of fruit or something since I am allergic to melon and they said no that it was premixed. The ""gourmet"" breakfast was cold french toast with mushy thawed frozen fruit on it.  I am not going to eat that. I asked again about any other alternatives and we were told sorry.  The female proprietor came around to several of the tables but not ours and I made mention of that to my bf.Upon check-out, I conveyed my dissatisfaction and was confronted with an extremely poor defensive attitude of ""what time did you wake up"", ""I wasn't in the dining room, I was busy booking plane tickets.""  She said the construction was not supposed to start till 9:30 am and that she would have fixed me something. Ya that's bull and I saw the nice organic whole grain muffins she was chomping on at the desk, not the slop she was feeding her clients.  It makes me sad, that people do not care about customer satisfaction in such a high dollar tourist area.UNDER CONSTRUCTION: 04/22/15-? Don't plan on being here 7am-4:45pm because the noise is unreal.   With only 23 Rooms and Rooms 22 &amp; 23 being completely renovated DO NOT STAY HERE until it's completed.Besides that, I Love everything about this place and can't wait to return when it's quieterWe had front row access to the most beautiful views of Sedona from the inn, which truly can't be beat! When we got there at check in time, front desk was closed (to run errands as there was a house emergency) so we patiently waited outside. It was cold and I wanted to get settled in.  Twenty minutes later, we were in our room! Don't get me wrong - the room was cute, southwestern, and very quaint! However, throughout my stay, there were things about the room that just didn't make me feel comfortable. For example, there was a lack of light in the living room, bathroom and bedroom. There were a few lights, but even when you turn them all on (Which by the way, you have to turn on one by one. There isn't one light switch that turns on two or three lights), it was so dim! I felt like I had to take a shower and get ready in practically the dark.  We tried our best to watch tv and lounge on the couch, but the couch wasn't very comfy. Even the bed looked pretty comfy at first, but the two nights I was there, I kept tossing and turning. I don't want to seem like I'm complaining too much - hence, the three star rating. The room was cute, the views are outstanding, you have access to hiking trails and it is a very small distance from restaurants, and the breakfast was restaurant quality! The first morning, we had breakfast burritos which were delicious and the second morning, we had french toast. However, when you pay $280/night, being comfortable should not be compromised.  So I'm not sure if I would stay here again if I visit Sedona.If it were left to just the room and accommodations, this B and B would easily earn 5 stars from me. However, because of the behavior of the male owner Phil, I have to give it 3. Twice during breakfast he talked us, which is fine, but these conversations mainly consisted of telling us why he does not trust those of the Muslim faith, and why he believes Barack Obama is a Muslim. Regardless of weather or not you agree with his views, this conversation is absolutely unprofessional and uncalled for. Other than that, we had a nice stay with nice amenities, and Janet and her son were both very nice and helpful, however we would not return because of this nuisance.Stayed at the sunset for a short but well needed vacation. Let me tell you...it's absolutely fantastic. Rooms and beautiful and have all the necessary items. The hot tub is beautiful which is rite next to a beautiful gas fireplace for the cold Sedona nights. The breakfast is beautiful and the owners are extremely accommodating for your dietary needs. Definitely a must stay for a nice relaxing get away.We really enjoyed the Sunset Chateau. The room was great. Very cozy and spacious. The bed was super comfortable, the bathroom nice and roomy with great products; shampoo, soaps,etc.Everything was clean and well maintained. Our only small complaint is that the breakfast is too limited. It would be great if a tray of rolls, Danish, etc. was available and maybe have 2 choices on the entrees. Otherwise, we would recommend this pretty B&amp;B to anyone visiting Sedona.We stayed in the Casablanca room # 1 and it was lovely.  Quiet and peaceful.  Room was clean and hosts very helpful.  Breakfast was not quite what we were hoping for.  Poached eggs not our thing.  Not till the second day when we went halfheartedly with the breakfast of the day did we see another guest get plain eggs and toast.  Was looking forward to the french toast from reviews.   I think that should be made a little clearer to guests.  No one mentioned that.  We stayed for two nights.  Parking was easy right by the room.  Grounds were lovely.  Would stay again.After reading multiple reviews and scouring multiple travel sites for the perfect hotel, I decided on this place for our weekend trip to Sedona.  The hotel sits near the end of a very dark street off the main drag in lower Sedona.  The outside is rustic and charming, with redwood gates in front of each room.  The lobby is jammed packed with local artists creations, all for sale.  It looks a little cluttered, but there were some beautiful works of art.  We were greeted by a very friendly young lady who offered suggestions of things to do in Sedona while handing us our keys.The rooms are more like miniature cottages, yet attached by adjoining walls.  In front of each room is a set of chairs and a small table, along with some decorations to make it look homey.  There is also a beautiful garden with a walking path behind the hotel. Our suite was beautifully furnished and each suite has its own theme.  We selected the romantica suite.  A small kitchenette, a sitting room with a comfy leather couch, a breakfast nook dining area and a canopy bed are just a few of the accoutrements. The room was clean and neat, but had that smell that is synonymous with hotel rooms (travelers know what I'm talking about).  A nice jacuzzi bath and stone-tiled shower were also present.A few things that prevent a five star rating:  I found spider webs in the corner of the ceiling in the bath room.  I also found some bright red stains on the canopy drape of the bed, and one of the chairs at the dining table had a bad crack in the arm.We only made it to breakfast on our last day there, but it was well prepared and tasty;  a delicious bowl of fresh fruit and a savory breakfast burrito with tangy salsa. Overall, the hotel was peaceful, clean and met all of our needs.  And the view from the rooms is nothing short of breathtaking.  Should we visit Sedona again, we will certainly stay at A Sunset Chateau again.I really hate rating this B&amp;B so high, because it will make it harder for us to get in the next time. If you want beautiful and calm, close, but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, this is it! Tucked up in the hills of Sedona, this gem is a beautiful facility. Our room, Bella Vista 21, had gorgeous views, as well as lovely furnishings. Look at their web site, rooms are described, pictures provided (and they are accurate) as well as the prices are listed. Many rooms have a jetted tub, which ours did, which was great after miles of hiking trails. The B&amp;B provides EO Products for shampoo, conditioner, soaps. and skin lotion. They also provide a EO facial soap bar. Look up EO products, good stuff! We had never used them and are looking into buying their products If you're looking for the uniformity of a Hilton (where we normally stay) this isn't it. Each room is distinctly and beautifully decorated. You are close enough to stores, but far enough away. Breakfast is served from 8:30 AM to 10:00 AM, so, if you're like me and rise early (normally 5:00 AM), there's an excellent bagel store 1.5 miles away, NY Bagels and Deli. Opens at 5 AM in summer months, 6 AM in other months. Excellent bagels and pastry! Some days I would go there and just get coffee and read the paper in the morning so my wife could sleep a little later; I'm pretty noisy. If you have kids with you they have nice donuts at NY Bagel as well; not that I sampled them! :) Loved the bagels. Breakfasts at A Sunset Chateau always has a special entree, but you can always get eggs, etc. All meals were very good. You can eat inside, in a well decorated dining room, or outside on a beautiful patio. This is where you most likely will run into the owner, Philippe Buillet, where he is always present, asking questions. Then again, you might run into him fixing a sprinkler line leak! When you leave you feel like you have known him for years! Super nice guy, as is all of the staff! Beautiful manicured gardens. Salt water pool and Jacuzzi. We left it two days ago and are already looking at next year's trip, but for more days (we were there 4 days)! ""Uptown"" (what they call it) is 3 miles away, which is basically the tourist location, with hotels, stores, and lots of traffic!Take a 1/2 hour trip to Jerome, but be warned, lots of hills, and a mountain ride! . It may not be good for kids or older people, although I am 65 and did fine. Get a burger at The Haunted Burger! Excellent! Read about Jerome, cool history. Again, we loved A Sunset Chateau and can't wait to go back!This place is Amazing!!! We had awesome views from our private little suite. The service was awesome. They knew about all the best places to hike and a list of things to see. We had a hit tub in our room with a large shower. The kitchen was great and fully furnished with pots and pans along with all the dishes you will need. The gas fire place was so nice.  We already booked our second weekend in February. Many more visits to come.We loved our stay here! The room was immaculate. The breakfast was great. Friendly and accommodating staff. I would recommend it. There was a breathtaking view from every angle.Stayed here in March for a girls trip with my mom.  This place was amazing!! The owners and staff were highly accommadating and super friendly.  The place was very zen and peaceful and everywhere you looked you can tell they took careful consideration to the decor and peacefulness.  It's off the main road and super quiet, with stores only a couple of blocks away.  The rooms were very spacious and decorated with thought.  Even the towels were high quality. We had a patio outside our room facing the beautiful courtyard in front of the man made waterfall/stream.  So we were able to hear the water as we sat and relaxed.  The pool and spa area is all inclosed around landscape and trees and there is even a nice fire place to sit and enjoy under the stars.  Across the street is one of the trails that lead straight to one of the Sedona vortexes. Very convenient.  And if you climb to the top can see 360 degrees of the beautiful mountains.They also have hammocks to relax in and benches under trees, so relaxing somewhere isn't a problem.  We stayed for four nights and every breakfast we had was amazing! If you didn't like what was being served just ask and they will make whatever you like! Only downside for me was they didn't start serving until 8am and have a very small kitchen staff. So the meal took longer to get than I would have liked, especially if you want to go out and explore or hike for the day.  I like to get an early start!  During breakfast you will always see the owners walking around and talking to people and helping them make their time there the best they can.  They are very helpful and anything you need ask. They can give advise on the top places and where not to go! I will defiantly be coming back! PS... you pay for what you get!! ( regarding some of the reviews that said too pricey)Sunset Chateau is the REAL deal in elegant classy southwestern art experience on the grounds and our room was SO beautiful and relaxing and the decor set the mood for sweet heavenly bliss!   We stayed in the Room #1 which had an excellent view of the Sedona Rocks....BEAUTIFUL!   Well worth every penny!!!    The owners are a Family and hands on, very personable, nice, helpful and this owner family was on site every single day @ breakfast.  And the breakfast was home made chef  level cuisine, simply delicious!!!    The pictures of the B&amp;B property are the REAL deal, what you see on the internet is what you see and get when you get to Sunset Chateau.Sunset Chateau was very conveniently located on the top hill in a secluded area but had access to various hiking trails, park, tennis, basketball, walking distance to shopping.  The mornings were cool and crisp perfect for morning walks!!!Our getaway dream come true was the BEST!   There are other B&amp;Bs to stay at in Sedona, but if you are looking for quiet, elegant, artiistic, fun  and convenience for walking trails and quick trips to town....Sunset Chateau fits the bill!!!We would Highly recommend this B&amp;B, when we return we will stay here again!!!Stayed in June 2015. I loved this place! Super clean, beautiful rooms, great service. Delicious breakfast. Feels very cozy. Beautiful property.  Convenient location to restaurants, food shopping, trails, vortexes. No complaints.I planned a last minute destination wedding that was on the property at this quaint amazing hotel. We stayed the weekend with friends and family. It was intimate, easy-going, beautifully landscaped and romantic. The views were amazing. I rented out the dining hall for an unbelievable price, hosted a reception for two hours with the assistance of a local chef. The price was unbelievable and the hosts did everything to accommodate our party. Now, -- guess how much that cost? Nothing. If you want a romantic weekend or a special reunion, event. PLEASE consider this place. It's utterly perfect. Oh,yes, it has all the normal stuff that hotels/resorts have, free gourmet breakfast, spa, jacuzzi tub, views to die for and its right in the middle of Sedona, but utterly peaceful and quiet.  My only complaint? I don't have a reason to get married again there!Found this B&amp;B on yelp as a last minute overnight and was pleasantly surprised. The owners son checked us in and was exceptionally pleasant, friendly and helpful with identifying local hikes &amp; restaurants in the area, even gave me a free stamp to mail a post card:)Our room and the public areas were decorated in an eclectic southwestern theme and I loved it. Our room had a large jacuzzi tub &amp; small kitchen that made me wish we were staying longer. The bed was very comfy and there was even a mock fireplace that added a unique charm to the room. There was a sitting room with a 32"" flat screen viewable from the bed. Breakfast was tasty we had eggs over English muffin with a hollandaise sauce and salsa. Coffee was Starbucks &amp; great. You had the option to eat on the terrace outside or in, but both had a spectacular view.Would definitely recommend &amp; would stay againThis bed and breakfast is clean and has a great view. Love the hammocks outside. Breakfast includes an omelette with ham veggies etc., instant oatmeal, cereal, orange juice, tea and coffee. The breakfast dining hall also has a great view of the red rocks.  Love this place except my only advice if you don't like firm beds it might not be the place for you.I highly recommend this place. The view from the rooms are spectacular. Lots of fun, centrally located. The Proprietors are very accommodating. The wife and I had a couples massage in our room. Very nice I might add. Breakfast is a real treat. Can't wait to come back. Love Sedona ThanksWe have stayed in Sedona many times. However this is our first time at Sunset Chateau. I found it by accident on the internet. The description on their web site made it look inviting. We stayed in the Vista Montana Suite. A large nicely decorated room with a patio that has a great view of the red rocks. The property has a number of paths leading to patio areas with lounging chairs and hammocks. The pool and hot tub provides a relaxing place among the flower gardens. The running streams and lush landscape adds to the ambiance. A full breafast is included and served in a colorful dining room or on the outdoor patio. Phillippe and Janet are hands on people, always available to chat or help with tours or dining suggestions. Thanks to Phillippe and Janet, Sunset Chateau is a hidden gem in the hills of Sedona and our new found place to stay.","I will stay here everytime I visit Sedona! Absolutely gorgeous location, vibe, art, decor, garden, and a friendly staff. Sitting outside on one of the many hammocks with the red rocks as the backdrop is amazing. So cozy.Sunset Chateau is as good as it gets! I've stayed in many places in Sedona but nothing has the charm of Sunset Chateau. The freshly made breakfast of high quality ingredients by a chef, the delicious coffee and juices while sitting at the top of the hill overlooking the gorgeous red rocks is just one great prize in this Sedona treasure. The owner, a lovely woman, greeted us at breakfast to be sure we were content. The sparkling clean rooms have new beds that are top of the line. The salt water jacuzzi awesome! Really, I can't say enough great things about this place. Take a drive and visit, you'll be blown away and booking a room!Stayed here last week, and had a beautiful time.  Stayed in the Bella Vista #20 room, and the views were spectacular.  It was a treat waking up and seeing the mountains first thing in the morning.  Breakfast could use some help (too salty sometimes), but it was extremely convenient when you want to get your day started. The staff was super helpful and accommodating, and our room was always cleaned.  couldn't have asked for more.This place has a strange mixed vibe of ""resort"" and family b&amp;b.  It felt like a resort how there were so many communal spaces, driveways and entrances for each room, manmade rushing river, instantaneous service for breakfast in the morning, etc.  But then down-homey family b&amp;b as far as the front desk service staff who were mellow and casual and sometimes helpful, sometimes not so much.The rooms themselves (we stayed in two different ones) were comfortable and super clean.  It seems outfitted for parties with lots of floor space, foldout beds, murphy beds, etc.  Although when we were there it was all quiet couplesNice hot tub which you can use at any time.  Only issue it is uber-chlorinated.  Turned my rings grey.Loved this place and everything about it. The owners and staff are friendly, the landscaping and room decor are beautiful. The breakfast was tasty and the vegetarians and gluten-intolerant guests were taken care of without the staff batting an eye! I plan to stay here again in the future! The only request I would have is to provide guests with robes for back and forth from the hot tub or pool.My wife and I booked this through a travel broker online as we were looking for a spontaneous weekend trip to Sedona.  The room was great and the staff were very nice.  Very nice location; we saw a Gambel's Quail family right in front of our doorway and hear coyotes at night.  The gardens on the property are very scenic and full of wildlife.  Bring some binoculars for bird viewing.  This property is also on the outskirts of town and some decent star gazing can be done from it.Booked the Bella vista room a month ahead of time.  This unit is located up the hill behind the check lobby and the views are amazing.  The room is very spacious and tastefully decorated.  Oversized tub for two was a godsend after a day of shopping and hiking.  There was complimentary breakfast every morning but we didn't take advantage.  Overall a very we'll kept property with a good amount of privacy, a nice pool and spa and several private chill areas with chairs, hammocks and lounges.  Great location right off the main road close to everything.  Loved waking up to a view of the red rocks every morning.  Would recommend for couples or groups.The room was very nice and spacious, the grounds were beautiful, the staff (owners?) were friendly, helpful and informative, the breakfast was delicious.  The only slight disappointment was that the wifi was not working properly - not really a big deal as we didn't spend much time on the internet.  Also - I left my rings in the bathroom when we checked out (wedding ring included), we got a call about an hour later that the rings were at the front desk waiting for me to pick them up - so I give them 5 stars just for being honest and having honest staff!  Thank you!!!!  We will be back.I highly recommend A Sunset Chateau. This BandB is an absolute gem! For the last 5 years my buddies and I have taken a trip to Sedona for a winter mountain bike trip. This year, we found A Sunset Chateau and were blown away by the accommodations. The breakfasts were fabulous and large enough to fill us up before our all day mountain bike rides. The owners were there every morning to offer up advice about the town or to just chat it up. The rooms are VERY new and clean. The wall beds are hand made by Phillipe (the owner) and are truly pieces of art .The hot tub and pool are gorgeous and feel very private. The best part is the view and of Sedona's amazing skyline.Totally a Southwestern experience.  The location is perfect and the scenery wonderful.  The staff is beyond pleasant and helpful.  Our room was tastefully decorated and with all the special attention to detail we were in awe of the level of cleanliness.  It was impossible to find a speck of dust (not that we spent a lot of time looking), but you can tell when a place is well cared for.  The owner takes time to greet her guests their first morning at breakfast.  It's a great place.  The breakfast could be expanded a little.  I'm very fond of food in general and each mornings breakfast had a Southwestern flare, my husband usually had to substitute with the offering of granola.  That aside...we loved the place.An all-around great experience.  My wife and I were there over President's Day weekend.  The rooms and facilities were cozy, quaint, and clean.  The staff were very courteous and helpful.  They go out of their way to help you with suggestions on what to do in the area.  The breakfasts were great.  We would definitely recommend A Sunset Chateau to anyone and would definitely go back.This is the most welcoming and beautiful B&amp;B I have ever been in. The views are spectacular and the staff very gracious. And the breakfasts are delicious.(although the coffee could be stronger) It is conveniently located off 89W near great restaurants.  I highly recommend this place.We stayed here 2 nights for NYE.   The Adobe Romatica was a great room - nice jacuzzi and the view from the balcony was definitely worth the money.I booked the room 2 months well in advance and the conceirge staff was amazing responding quickly to all my emails.  They'll help you book dinners and plan activities.Unfortunately, the weather nixed plans of having a hot air balloon ride on our check-out day.  I was frantic but Rochelle helped plan a helicopter ride for us which ended up being better.  The service is amazing.  The breakfast was really really good.  My only complaint is that the walls were thin in my room.  I'm not mad though - most people go to B&amp;B's for special occasions and i cant fault people for having a good time but maybe putting some more insulation or stationing the beds opposite sides.  I'm sure they felt the same way...It's all good.  I'd definitely come back and am a fan of B&amp;B's!For my birthday, I decided to treat myself... What a treat!  This place is top notch, absolutely beautiful and the perfect location.   We arrived early afternoon, and just sat outside on the swing near the pool in the sunshine.  The grounds are well kept, hammocks, lounge chairs, even a small bed near the pool.  Everyone working was wonderful.  Upon check in, the gent immediately booked me a dinner reservation before I could finish my sentence, and got us checked in quickly, gave us maps and ideas for drives and walks.  The B&amp;B is directly across the road from Airport trail, so we took that hike early in the AM, and it is an easy walk and beautiful!   Breakfast was served by the sweetest woman I believe we met all weekend.   Continental is there as well as a made to order breakfast.    There was a high maintenance woman behind us complaining, so we were extra nice to our server, as well as very vocal about leaving her a tip for working so hard (sometimes, you've just gotta set an example).  My only regret was not staying a week!  The rooms have everything you need, and you can even keep a little nosh for your late night wine drinking on the front porch or swing while you bask in the amazing view.   There were plenty of places to choose from, and I'm so glad I chose this place!My husband and I wanted a quick weekend get away for our anniversary.  We have been to Sedona many times and decided to try a Bed and Breakfast for a more romantic atmosphere.  The property is easy to find but is located in a strange area surrounded by the Humane Society, a mini-storage place, apartments, and a mobile home park.  On the plus side, there are many good restaurants near by and a natural grocery store just down the street.  Our room was well appointed and the view of the red rocks was amazing.  I had recently started an exercise regime so I was looking forward to the jacuzzi tub to soak my aching muscles.  I started the bath but was disappointed to find that they did not include any bath jell in the room.  Why have a wonderful tub with no bath products?  My next disappointment was when I pushed the button for the jacuzzi to start and nothing happened. My husband called the front desk and they told him to press the little breaker by the tub.  He did so but it switched off again immediately.  I didn't want to be electrocuted so I sat in hot water with no bubbles and no jacuzzi jets.  Not really what I would expect from a $300 per night room.  We went down to the jacuzzi by the pool, again hoping to help my aching muscles.  The water was not even hot, just luke warm but at least the jacuzzi jets worked.  My next irritation was the nasty smell coming from the armoire.  I hung my clothes in it but decided to leave the doors open so the smell would not get on my clothes.  I later wore one of my shirts and all I could smell was the mildewy smell from the armoire.  I promptly removed my clothes and lived out of my suitcase for the weekend.  Saturday morning we woke up refreshed and went down to breakfast a little early to have some coffee and discuss the time for our massage with the front desk.  We were hoping to move the time back a bit because we were going to book a tour that would conflict with the massage.  When we got to the breakfast room it was locked and several groups of people were waiting outside.  You couldn't even get in to the building to talk to the front desk or sit down or have a cup of coffee.  Right at 8:30 (a bit late for breakfast especially in a place where people enjoy getting up early and going hiking, biking, etc.) the doors opened.  Coffee, milk, juice and some dry cereal were available.  We were served a wonderful omelet but the overall offerings were a bit limited.  I went to the front desk to ask about our massages and before I even finished asking if we could change the time, the rude owner behind the desk, who would hardly take his eyes off of the computer screen, began shaking his head negatively.  He started to say it was too difficult and why did I want to move it.  I explained that our tour would be back at 2 and our massage was scheduled at 3pm.  Again, before I could even finish my sentence he interrupted me and said I would have plenty of time to get back and there shouldn't be a problem.  Obviously, if our tour was scheduled to return at 2pm and we were across town, and we were hot, tired and needed showers, there would not be enough time to get back for the massage.  The owner was very rude and kept barking at me about the time and it would be fine.  He finally said something like...well I guess I could call them but it probably wont work.  I was boiling mad and just walked away.  At no time during our stay did the owners ever follow up about the broken bath tub or follow up about the massage issue.  We ended up moving our tour to the next day and had our massages as scheduled.  The masseurs were amazing and are one of the only reasons I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1.  One other thing to mention, the owners walk around during breakfast and stop at each table for a friendly chat.  Which I would normally think was fine except they would stand there and talk and talk and monopolize your breakfast.  It was really frustrating to see table after table have their breakfasts interrupted for 5-10 minutes while the owners tried to engage them in conversation.  Again, a nice hello and how are you doing would have been fine but to stand there and bother the patrons while they are trying to relax and have their breakfasts was just too much.  Obviously others have had good experiences here but I would beware if you are expecting a high end experience.My mother and I are on a trip to the Grand Canyon and wanted to stop in Sedona to break up the drive. I found A Sunset Chateau online. They are not cheap but I wanted a good experience for my Mom. They were efficient and friendly with the reservation and again when I called to extend by a day. The experience continued when we arrived with a warm greeting and lots of helpful info. I was slightly worried that their website over-stated things - but it doesn't! Lovely first-class rooms, well landscaped with beautiful views, fun art and decor throughout the property, conveniently located, and providing a DELICIOUS breakfast. It is not cheap but it is a great place to stay if you can afford it.Sunset Chateau bed and breakfast was amazing, beautiful hill top villa with a majestic view of the Sedona mountains. Loved the southwestern decor and casita style landscape! Thanks to Jean for your warm welcome and personalized greeting! Be back again soon.I wanted to take my husband to Sedona for his birthday, and after researching all of the hotels, resorts and bed and breakfasts in Sedona; I settled on A Sunset Chateau. What a wonderful choice that was! We were awed by the beauty of the location of this boutique hotel. We were even more inspired by the architecture, decor and grounds. My husband commented that it looked a lot like a Chateau he had stayed in in Switzerland, and we were thrilled to meet Philippe and discover that was exactly what the place was modeled after! Our room, Belle Vista, was LOVELY and the views were incredible. We savored every minute of our time there, resting in the hammock, soaking in the Jacuzzi under the starlit sky, dining on their outdoor patio, enjoying our delicious omelette at breakfast. It was more than I could have hoped for for my husband's birthday. He was genuinely overwhelmed! Thank you Philippe and Janet! We look forward to coming back!my stay here was my graduation gift from high school and it was fantastic. The owners are soooo nice and the place is beautiful. The pool overlooks the mountain, the rooms are cozy, and it is located near everything. I have been wanting to come back every year since! Oh and the breakfast was really good. When I was there they had a chef preparing the breakfast entree of the day or if the option doesnt suit your fancy you can always have the standard continental stuff that is provided. If you stay here you must try the pizano's pizzaria that is near by, MMMmmmm so yummy!Chose this place because of the rooms! Amazing patio with gorgeous view of the red rocks, the B&amp;B has a vintage/rustic feel and the rooms are modern and new! Every part of this place has the Sedona theme tied in, so much attention to detail! We stayed in the premium casita, it has a kitchen, two tvs w/ DVD players, mini fridge, pots and pans, dishes, coffee to make for the morning, yummy smelling lotions, the list goes on! The family that runs the place is so accommodating! I could not find one thing wrong with the Sunset Chateau,  pool with jacuzzi and fireplace, super close to trails (teacup trail) and downtown Sedona! I am coming here again, felt like a 5 star resort with the quaintness of a bed and breakfast!","My wife and i simply cannot understand the plethora of positive reviews. From a cobweb-rich room with sunken mattresses to a curt, rude young owner, and the worst coffee with burnt taste, this place simply does not live up to its reputation.Breathtaking views, beautiful rooms, great breakfast. I can not say enough great things about this place.We stayed here two nights, and had different rooms both times. The adobe romantica room is the most amazingly romantic and perfect room I have ever stayed in. Each detail is considered and very well done. The jacuzzi next to the bed, the shower, the extremely comfortable and romantic bed... the fireplace (which is for aesthetics only, it doesn't give off any heat), the couches. Everything was great. Not to mention the view. Absolutely breathtaking. The grounds are nice as well. When we first arrived, we were a little skeptical because the building looks like a motel. The inside, however, did not. There is a pool and hot tub outside. The second room we stayed in was Pueblo bonita. It was on the second floor and the view from there was incredible. So incredible that we got engaged on the balcony there that night. The room itself was not as romantic as the Adobe but still charming and comfortable. The breakfast was insanely good. Fat slices of French toast with fresh fruit and eggs florentine. YUM.I'd recommend a Sunset Chateau to those who want a romantic getaway in Sedona. It really is worth the several hundred dollars you'll spend to stay.Loved this place!  The rooms really are as lovely as they appear on the website, and even though the place was full the weekend we visited, we felt like we were the only ones there.  The view from our patio was spectacular and we spent both early evenings there on the patio, taking in the view with a bottle of wine.  Breakfast is served from 830-10 am and shouldn't be missed.",,,"['owners', 'run', 'great', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'establishment', 'literally', 'transforms', 'seclusion', 'enjoy', 'views', 'serve',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sedona-rouge-hotel-and-spa-sedona,Sedona Rouge Hotel & Spa,3.5,$$$,119,"It was a beautiful and wonderful trip... If it wasn't or the extra fees this place charges.... We booked two nights for almost $300 but when we got here they told us we had to pay a resort fee. Also we booked a king size bed but I wanted to change to two queens... Of course this isn't Vegas but I thought slight changes would be comped..... they ""upgraded"" us for an additional $10 per night... Yay...... Our total two night stay was a lot pricier than expected. We checked in the first night at almost 10pm because.... We were coming from far... The room was spacious, honestly expected a little bigger for the price... And it did not have a tub...  For a spa resort I thought it would have a tub so we can soak ourselves after hiking through the beautiful canyons with their soaps. The service was impeccable but due to the fact that we went on a monday and tuesday... we were probably the few patrons there hahaha! The front desk delivered a bar soap when I asked..personally haha and there is no ice machine so they deliver it to you. Anything you ask for is given to you hahaha but definitely is included in your extra charge.. remember that.On the website it says that we can use the pool area and the steam room but I couldn't figure out where the steam room was...and plus I was too tired after to look for it but when you're there please go look for it and use it on behalf of us.They offer a free appetizer at the restaurant. ONE free appetizer with the ticket... or it's ""small dish"" but you must purchase something. I, like another reviewer went out of spite to get the small dish because I felt like we were getting over charged. Luckily I did not have a problem with the view or the roof patio. Yes, it was freezing..but my mom and I wanted to have our full vacation experience so we bundled up and went up on the patio to drink our wine. Overall this place was great! I had no complaints, the beds were comfortable and the place was clean. The heater doesn't go over 80 though... I'm sure they have a reason. Their Wi-fi worked perfectly fine. They give you one free movie heehee.. I watched 2 but didn't finish it.... so it won't get charged HAHAHAAHA I just... really didn't feel good about the resort fee they charge or tell you when you get there...they should just state it when we book so we know and it doesn't surprise us. No ones going to turn away from the resort fee of about 20 dollars a day but...it's just an unpleasant surprise. Beautiful place with amazing views and breath taking canyons... Next time I'll make sure to plan thoroughly and research more. I recommend... IF you have money to spend.. after all it's a vacation!I will start with a negative and end on a positive. Upon arriving, we were tacked on a mysterious $20 resort fee, and explained that in addition to the rate we had payed it gives us a free app at their restaurant (so it forces you to go out of spite to get some of that 20 back, the spa, pool, etc). We were explained this supposedly gives an edge for competition in the area - in short, their place appears cheaper initially compared to surrounding hotels/resorts, but when you arrive you are forced to pay, what other choice did we have? Didn't help the staff didn't have the knowledge to properly explain it, making us feel duped. The fitness center is outdated. On a positive - the food at the restaurant we got lured into had good quality food as a saving grace with excellent staff and wonderful pianist. The room itself was wonderful with an extremely comfortable bed and amazing shower. You can find cheaper and better accommodation elsewhere. It's a shame, because it left a bad taste to an otherwise beautiful 5 star potential hotel.This review is mainly for my visit to the Rouge for a 3-4 day writing retreat that was being held in two of their big conference rooms. Also for eating in the restaurant.   When I was planning my stay in Sedona for a writing retreat, I was given special room rates to stay at the Rouge ($148 a night discount for retreat attendees). I'm on a strict, smaller budget so I declined and stayed at another hotel a small drive away. The Rouge is a really nice looking hotel. I didn't get to see any of the room accommodations but the conference rooms with their comfortable chairs, rooftop terrace, and restaurant were very nice. I had the buffet lunch in the Reds restaurant. The lunch was good and filling but of course with myself on a budget, my $15 could have been less spent by going across the street to the Safeway or to any other eateries around the area. But the Rouge is an expensive hotel and the price of the food is expected to be high as well.   From my point of view, The Rouge was great. The staff was nice and answered any questions I had.This used to be my favorite hotel with 5 star rating. Unfortunately I am dropping it to a 3 after my experience last weekend. (1) First off, I love their stand up shower next to the tub. The last few times I was here, they gave us a plastic place mate for use to prevent from slipping. It wasn't there.(2) When I reach for the complimentary shower items, they mistakenly gave us 2 bottle of lotion rather than the shower gel. I ended up taking a shower with a hand soap. (3) The luggage holder hidden in the closet was broken. One of the screws felt off and obviously it would not hold the luggage. Sigh....(4) The front desk was service by few inexperience teenagers. (5) lastly, their ventilation system in the bathroom was extemely noisy. We can also hear the water pipe shaking when our next door room is taking a shower. Eventually it woke us up 6:30am in the morning. Rating: this is the first hotel I usually make reservation at when I come up here to Sedona. Now...I am not too sure I want to come back again.What a nice little spot! Great location in Sedona. Walking distance to some great coffee shops and restaurants. Very nice spacious room. The shower was amazing. The pool and hot tub area were very nice. Spa was wonderful. I wish the facilities had been just a little bit bigger, but really I should not complain. It was very relaxing and peaceful. The esthetician I saw was very skilled. The staff was the friendliest I've seen at a hotel in a long time. The hotel ran a leap year sale- it was such a bargain! We will definitely be coming back to Sedona and will stay here again!* Good, clean room/bed/bathroom.  Quiet, pleasant stay.* Supermarket, Starbucks, Pisa Lisa Restaurant, all a few steps away.* One young front desk staff with an attitude that can make you forget that the rest of the staff was very polite.* Pet Friendly!  Pet fee not mentioned on website is $50 per pet, per night.* Imposed resort fee, you may or may not find useful.I'd stay here again, but have second thoughts only because of the snarky young guy at the front desk.This hotel is pet friendly &amp; that's the main reason I picked it. From the outside its very beautiful with a gorgeous courtyard but the rooms need some work. Everything was clean but the bathroom was old &amp; looked it &amp; the towels were worn out. The furniture could use an update too &amp; the biggest problem was the patio pet area. We happened to be in town when it was raining &amp; our patio was soaked each day of our stay. The grass area was total mush &amp; my dogs couldn't use it because when they stepped out each day it was a large puddle of mud. This was super inconvenient because we had to leave our room to walk them several times a day. I also paid a lot of extra money to have a pet area but we couldn't use it. The service was very friendly &amp; the hotel is centrally located. I hope they update the rooms &amp; redo the pet area.Wow is this place expensive! We stayed here for one night for close to $350 per night. Compared to hotels I've stayed at in Sedona where the price is closer to $150-200/night, the only differences I noted were:- Slightly fancier soaps and shampoos- Fancier ice buckets with tongs- Unique furniture and glassware- Granite countertop bathroom- Turn down serviceIs that worth another 200 dollars to me? For me it's not. In terms of noise level, I couldn't hear any of my neighbors next door, but I could hear some banging of the water pipes and the sound of the shower running from other rooms early in the morning. In addition, the A/C unit was really loud, and the A/C remote very non-intuitive, which meant it took quite a bit of random button mashing to turn it off.The bathroom itself was a large size, but the tiles in the shower were larger than typical shower floor tiles and too smooth, a possible slip hazard. The shower itself was an odd tub/shower combo. On one side was a dedicated tub, and right next to it was the shower head. It seemed like they added the shower head as an afterthought after tiling the entire floor and walls with the same beige smooth tiles. In addition, some of the grout on the bathroom walls had suspicious black spots on it... possible mold? The bed was comfortable and included a light comforter and 4 pillows. I had no problem falling asleep. The TV was a decent size and had a good selection of channels to choose from.Overall, this place is OK but for the price point, I'd rather stay somewhere else.I came here for a spa appointment but wasn't staying at the hotel. The grounds are pretty and the spa is immaculate and very pretty. They have a beautiful steam room, hot tub and sitting area. I had a hot stone massage with Gilda, she was German and was friendly and did a wonderful job. I have very sore muscle and felt amazing after. The entire experience was wonderful. Thank you!!!Too expensive for all the reasons I'm about to list:1. WiFi doesn't work (apple devices don't like to connect to the network for some reason... Ok, a lot of people have iphones and macs)2. Construction right outside out our window starting at 8 am.3. We were told the rooftop terrace was a great place to have some wine, look at the stars, etc... It was closed.4. Elevator was closed.5. Blackout curtains wouldn't close. Hello 5 am wake up call!6. Had to have our room keys reprogrammed 3 times. Remember how the elevator was out of service?To be to be fair, we didn't eat at the restaurant or use the spa and I guess they're nice. We won't be returning to try them.Don't stay here. Over priced. Total commercial reality at its best. All about the benjamins. You will not feel a spiritual energy here. Under construction. Pet fee 50 each a night and you have to have a real service dog like mine not a companion pet. Charged for coffee at restaurant if you take it away it's free, but if you sit at restaurant you pay 3 bucks a cup. Heavy equipment noise. Small property and way overpriced.  Comfortable beds that you jump out of from the construction noise! Hotel manager argued my sister over coffee charge. Total ass! 600 dollars for 1 night on 2 rooms with no bell hop, no wet hand cloths upon arrival NO PERKS AT ALL. And your pet room is just that a room that someone else's pet pissed up and they masked with deodorizer! Run away!Excellent service! Near our first room, portions  of the hotel were under construction during our visit, subsequently aggravating my fiancees allergies. When we brought this concern to management They accommodated us with no hesitation, offering to move our bags and holding the doors!  The attached restaurant had the most mouth watering food, in a subtle laid back ambience - jazz music and the like with amiable waiters and bartenders. We highly recommend the Hotel and its environs we will be back if not just to enjoy the ""build your own"" chicken quesadilla while listening to the smooth toons of Benny Goodman being played live by one of the featured musicians! Kudos!The staff were friendly and helpful. Hotel is nice. Rooms are quiet. It's a bit pricey I feel for it's standard but maybe this was a busy weekend.Restaurant ""reds"" food is good, service is friendly and QUICK. Kitchen faces out into the restaurant and adds to the atmosphere Love that.BEWARE:  It doesn't say anywhere that the hotel is under construction on the site that we booked. I'm staying 3 nights in a Spa Suite, paying a pretty steep premium. We have a spectacular view of the... parking lot. We can hear the sweet sounds of ... construction. At night we like to go up to the observation deck... or we would if it was open. The staff was completely unhelpful when I pointed all of this out, I was told I was wrong, the construction and closing of the observation deck are disclosed on all sites. It is not. You only get a few vacation days a year and we came here to relax, the stress of having to deal with this is really awful. Stay away from this hotel, four star prices with one star service.The Sedona Rouge was a very nice hotel, and we would definitely go back. The hotel, both outside and inside, was very pretty, and the location is excellent. It was a quick drive to all the scenic spots, and it was centrally located in Sedona so we had easy access to everything in the town. Breakfast in the morning, while not part of your nightly rate as in some hotels, was good, and they offered us a lot of really great local restaurant recommendations (rather than just try to keep us in their own restaurant). I will just say one thing to those thinking of making a reservation here: we reserved a room with a mountain view, which is a little extra nightly. When we looked out the window, we could see some mountain peeking over another building, but it wasn't a mind-blowing beautiful unobstructed view, which you'll probably find at some of the much pricier hotels. So bottom line, you'll see some mountain, which is more scenic than the street on the other side, but it may not be what you're imagining. Take that into consideration when choosing a room and decide whether the extra money is worth it. I wasn't unhappy with my decision.I would recommend this to anyone traveling to Sedona!My dog and I stayed the night here recently. We won it so it was free.I brought everything I thought my dog would need but I was delighted to see that they put a set of dog bowls and a dog bed in the room prior to our arrival. The grounds were lovely - we enjoyed the Column Garden, the pool area, and reading in the center courtyard. The bed was comfortable and we slept great. I used the fitness center to get in a run on the treadmill.I had the macaroni and cheese at Reds for dinner - very good but a little excessively greasy.I had two minor quibbles about this hotel - #1 - There is a lack of power outlets in the room. I was glad I packed my extension cord to make it easier to use my phone while it was charging. I had to crawl under the desk to plug it in.#2 - I came to this hotel to do some writing. I was disappointed by the lack of lighting in the pool area after dark. I was hoping to sit by the water and write. The water was well lit, but not the surrounding area beyond what you need to see where you're walking.This review is for the spa only. I make it a point never to be someone's last appointment so I was nervous when I booked a 6 o'clock hot stone massage but I was pleasantly surprised! My therapist was Giri and she was wonderful. Her pressure is firm but it's what I needed and prefer. *During the lower back massage she does massage your upper butt but I was fine with that lol also massages the side butt cheek when she does your legs so if and of that makes you uncomfortable just tell her. The spa itself is really nice and clean. They have a nice steam room and private jacuzzi. *I wish she would've done some scalp massage and jaw massage. *Also in the beginning of the massage she had to mess with the music because they still use CD's. Overall I was really happy with my experience.* It's the next day and I'm super sore... I guess she was to firm. I hope I feel betterI had a very pleasant stay here with my parents. The rooms are very big, and the bathrooms are enormous. The hot water is piping hot, so you can actually take a really good bath that creates a sauna like atmosphere. What a treat!After reading a lot of reviews before our stay, I felt like the hotel made a lot of changes to address the complaints. There were plenty of outlets in our room due to them putting in extra outlets. The wifi was great, and had a very strong signal.  In terms of the resort fees, it was $19/day which I didn't think was that much after reading another review saying the charge came up to much higher. The resort fee evened out since we made good use of the facilities. We got a small plate at Reds, used the jacuzzi and checked out the observation desk with a fireplace at night. Reds is next door which is conveniently located, with a comforting pleasant atmosphere. After driving for the first half of the day, we just didn't want to go hunting around for a restaurant so Reds was perfect way to the end the day with a glass of red wine and some music.All in all I really enjoyed our stay here. The one thing they can't change is the location. Someone complained about it being next to a Safeway, which can be a little strange, but honestly, I would rather be by civilization. If you want to be out in the booneys, there are plenty of resorts there (I saw them on the way to Cathedral Rock) so you can look for that. But I like being by things, coffee shops, shopping, etc, so I didn't mind the locale at all. Plus, there Java Love across the street with legit espresso/coffee for the mornings. If you want a place with comfortable rooms then this is the place to stay.*Spa only* My daughter and I both had hot stone massages. The staff made us feel comfortable and did an amazing job. Matthew and Bobbie were both wonderful. They made sure to ask us what we would like to have worked on and their magic hands did the rest. I'd come back to see them again for sure :-)We've had a great two evenings at Sedona Rouge. The location is within a comfortable distance to all the lovely shopping and art boutiques Sedona has to offer like Tlaquepaque. Also, next door is a grocery store where we stocked up on supplies before our next destination.Even if you don't have a room with a view, the third floor terrace is perfect to capture a view of the red rocks. Why the 4 stars? The bed lacks comfort. I think it is supposed to be a pillow-top, but I'm not sure. And, the $19.00 per day resort tax. Most places offer free wi-fi and water but these are a part of that fee. I would suggest just rolling it into the rate as opposed to annoying people like us with a fee attached to things we don't/won't use like the spa and daily newspaper...they still print those?!? The rest of the room is awesome. Huge walk-in shower, gas fireplace, mini fridge, chaise lounge, chair with reading table, desk, quality toiletries and very friendly staff. We also had a small balcony which was a nice bonus.","My husband used airbnb for the first time and unknowingly booked us in a shared space for our anniversary. The place was small, hot, was under construction and had no privacy.  It turned into a stressful situation so we decided to move to a hotel. When we arrived a lady with blonde hair in bangs was working the front desk. I had a migraine at that point and was holding back tears. She upgraded the room we booked on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>, gave us free food and spa viscount vouchers and sent a complimentary bottle of wine to the room. She was so sweet and the hotel was much nicer than expected. I highly recommend this place!Wasn't too impressed with this hotel after a recent weekend getaway stay.  The Hubs and I decided last minute to spend a weekend in Sedona and scoured the internet for a good deal.  After looking for several days for a deal, we settled on the Sedona Rouge based on how nice the hotel looked for the price.  I did feel the ""resort"" fee was a bit excessive considering this really isn't a resort.  I'm pretty sure they only can call it that since there is a restaurant on site as well as spa facilities, but oh well.When we arrived we asked for a room with a view of the rocks, but none were available.  We were put in a room overlooking the near by houses and it was pretty disappointing (as far as the view is concerned).  The ""balcony"" is a joke.  It's basically a window the has a sliding glass door.  The room was pretty clean and spacious.  The air conditioning unit was very loud and made all sorts of funny sounds.  One of our lights didn't work (the one in the hallway).  We were disappointed that there wasn't a tub in the bathroom, but I found the shower to be very nice with the rain-type shower head.  The extra amenities they provide were also nice and generous.The location to town is good, only about a five minute drive.  Being close to Safeway and other food options is also nice, but it was a bit odd.  All in all, I can't say we'll be back.  There are a lot of options in Sedona and I'd probably opt to try something different next time.  Set your expectations for a Holiday Inn or Courtyard Marriott when arriving at Sedona Rouge.6:30am with luggage in tow I walk into the lobby and ask ""do I need to check out?"" Normally I am met with a ""no sir, you are all set"" or a ""yes sir, let me get you a receipt"".  Here I am met with an ""I don't know, do you?"" In a sarcastic insulting tone. I'm thinking to myself who hired this rude bell boy and let him sit at the front and come to find out its the General Manager!!! Plain and simple, He should be fired.Everyone else was nice and so was the room. I really enjoyed everything except the incredibly rude GM. Also they charge a resort fee on top of all the other fees even if you book through an external website.This is an attractive, clean hotel and the staff was friendly and responsive.  The beds and pillows and linens were not comfortable, but the real thing I could not get past was the bathroom.  The bathroom door did not lock or even latch, there was no bathtub, and the shower was very odd.  The shower did not have a door-it was not a snail shower-it just didn't have a door.  It also had two shower heads which meant by the time you were finished showering the entire bathroom floor, which was slick ceramic tile, was awash in water. It wasn't aesthetically pleasing and it wasn't functional.  So strange.Very friendly and knowledgable reception staff. Beautiful facility with great ambiance. Massage therapists were great at pre-identifying pain and stress points to focus on during session. Responsive throughout session. Great, 1 hours, very relieving Swedish massage - would do deep tissue if I went back. After you have full access to resort pool amenities including a hottub, steam room, private showers. Not overly expensive and well worth the money. Will definitely be returning, possibly even a second time on this trip!Did a mother daughter weekend trip here. We've done several spa get aways over the years. When we first arrived I thought the hotel was a little modest on amenities but we wouldn't be spending a lot of time in the hotel so no biggie. The service immediately on arrival was friendly and fast. We had our first spa treatment that afternoon. Again, the amenities in the spa were modest but, hey, we came here for the treatment so, no biggie. I have to say, my massage was one of the best I have ever had. My masseuse Barbara was extremely knowledgable and her experience not only allowed for a spectacular massage but left me with a new understanding on how to maintain a healthy and balanced life. I was really inspired. After our treatments my mother I decided to say in the hotel and enjoy the restaurant and lounge instead of venturing out. The food, service, and live entertainment was very impressive. The next morning we started our day with free morning yoga. Our instructed Heather was amazing and again, I felt inspired. We had our next spa treatment that morning and again... Absolutely fantastic! We didn't feel rushed or obligated to buy product which in most spas we have visited the 60 minute churn and burn is a priority. The drive from the hotel into town and to a few popular hiking spots is relatively short and easy and on our return back to the hotel, our welcome was friendly and accommodating. I have to say, Sedona Rouge was one of our best stays and we will be visiting again!This hotel is fine. Checked in on NYE for a quick couple's getaway. We were immediately happy with the set-up of our ""red-rock"" room. One problem: no view of the red rocks! The ""balcony"" was about seven inches deep and overlooked a grocery store parking lot. Romantic. Decidedly over-priced at $220 during the off season, and the photos displaying fireplaces are wildly misleading. Also very strange: the catalog of the room's furnishings...which are apparently for sale?I'm giving the Sedona Rouge a solid 'meh'.Good things, which earned stars:-Barbara at the front desk is knowledgeable and delightful.-The pool is quiet.-The entryway with the fountain and star jasmine is gorgeous.-Beautiful pillars and architecture-Pina Coladas at Reds-Across the street from Safeway to get groceries-Fluffy towels and Bathrobes-Pet-friendly with a doggie bag station outsideNot so good things:-The resort fees added $300 to our total, which we had to negotiate to have taken off (after we had booked though a site online, it added that unknowingly).-Everyone else in the staff seems timid or too buttoned up. Too stiff.-No view of the red rocks from the outside patio. It was just grass and a fence.-Cost is higher than normal for Sedona, I guess. I'm used to traveling to cities so $300 is okay, but apparently that's high for here. After this I found a hidden gem that was better and 1/3 of the cost.-The pool was freezing. I couldn't get in.-Not the best food at Reds. -I found a better place with free wifi &amp; free breakfast.Didn't try the spa though. I think there are a few good things about this place (mostly Barbara) but will not be booking again.This hotel considers itself a resort and as such, bills a mandatory daily incidentals fee for ""resort"" services. These include ""high speed"" Wi-Fi and several other ""amenities"" one would expect as standard in a hotel that charges over $200 per night.Nevertheless, since I'm paying for it, it's not unreasonable to expect the Wi-Fi to work. It doesn't and when I asked at the front desk shortly after check-in, I was told that the signal in the ONE router they have sometimes doesn't reach rooms like mine in the far corners of the building! On the other hand, they did offer to move me to a room closer to the router (and closer to the noise of the open air lobby). I don't know about you, but I believe that reliable Wi-Fi service is pretty much mandatory today for both business and leisure travelers. If you're reading this, you know exactly what I mean.Until they fix this problem, I say stay away if you expect to use any device requiring a working internet connection. FYI, I'm writing this on the landing outside my room, which is the only place I can get a reliable connection.If you're going to book here, do yourself a favor and shell out that little extra for a room with a view. Waking up to glowing red towers of rock outside your balcony window, that change by the hour in a play of shadow and light, is absolutely worth it. But, bear in mind, if you've stood atop the tallest man-made wonders, or you've hiked the summit of several world-renowned mountains, it's doubtful the view will be badass enough for you. Even still, it's impossible not to breathe it in deep and relax.And that's the entire feel of the hotel: relaxation. The overall, famed good vibe of Sedona is sweetly complimented by the Rouge's lovely amenities. The simple fact that I was able to soak it in, decompress and de-stress while traveling with a toddler (whose mission in life is to break the mommy) is a testament to its glory. I look forward to returning, hopefully with a suitcase full of more lingerie and less sippy cups.Absolutely horrific.  What a terrible hotel and even worse management.  We booked our family from Holland to stay in Sedona on their way to the Grand Canyon.  The booking was one day incorrect and we tried to make a change.  They told us they would not transition the day and we would also have to pay a cancellation fee.  Nice way to ruin a thanksgiving.  The reservation agent, Jennifer, was cold and unkind.Sedona Rouge was fantastic! My significant other took me here for a short weekend away from Scottsdale, AZ. I recently moved from Oklahoma and was in much need to see flowers and GREEN haha. Barbara was the front desk attendant and upgraded our room to a Spa room. It was WONDERFUL! We ate and had drinks at the RED restaurant. Everything was splendid other than our drink refills at the bar top. I'm a drinker and usually expect when my drink only has 1/4 left, I'm usually offered another drink. Besides that it was great. They also had live music which was an added bonus. All in all a great experience!Absolutely love this place. We  brought our french bulldog and stayed in one of the pet stay rooms. So nice to be able to walk out onto your patio and have the dog area right there. The room itself was great, nothing lacking, plus a very friendly staff. I got a massage at the spa with Giri, who was amazing...she knew exactly what I needed. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 is because of the construction.  Relaxing by the pool wasn't quite so relaxing due to the noise. But other than that we loved this resort.From the warm greeting from Jane at reception to the fabulous massage from Giri I had wonderful spa day. The facility is gorgeous, I enjoyed just sitting outside next to the spa tub and listening to the wind run thru the bamboo trees. Excellent service and very clean. Might put a screen in front of the waiting lounge, seems a bit odd to sit in your robe as folks pass through.I work in the industry for a highly-rated property so my personal standards are very high for the hotels that I stay at. Sedona Rouge met and then exceeded my expectations in every way. This does not include a review of their restaurant Red's, however, that I will write about in a separately.  We were set to stay at L'Auberge for our wedding and honeymoon until they charged the full total of our stay onto my Amex... After fainting, I picked myself off of the floor and knew we had to find somewhere else to stay. At first I wasn't TOO excited about staying here, we took our dog with us so that confined us to one room type on the first floor. But once we checked in we were thrilled with our room, the property and room look even better than the pictures online. Because we were in Sedona for our wedding, room service brought us champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries within one hour of checking in. They also arranged for a small table and linens to be placed in our room for our wedding cake at no additional charge. Room service is quick and efficient and everybody at the front desk was friendly and sweet, especially Sienna, Michael, and Daniel, they were all a huge help to us. Even though the hotel isn't within walking distance of the shops and galleries, it is conveniently located across from the Safeway shopping center and we were able to walk to Dahl and DiLuca for dinner. Also, because the hotel is a bit further away from the town it seemed to me the nighttime star viewing was even better than in other parts of Sedona.The spa is lovely, high-class and relaxing. Do try next time you visit. Also, they have specials on their website that are not advertised elsewhere and cannot be booked by calling the hotel. I highly recommend you check out the website first to see what deals you can get. We scored huge for our 7 night stay; they also gave us free appetizer coupons to use during happy hour at Red's, one for each night.I booked this hotel because if it's professed ""spa"" atmosphere and views but was incredibly disappointed. My overall impression of the hotel was that it was a glorified motor lodge that can over charge because of its Sedona locale. Beds are great, but  any real view non-existent, pool like a kiddie pool, and ""resort"" staff virtually none existent if not rude or indifferent. I wish we had booked anywhere else. We even had to pay a ""resort fee"" to use the pool and another $20 per too. To ensure our view was not overlooking a brick wall. Would not recommend at all.I don't know why this hotel doesn't get higher ratings. I found it to be a warm, welcome hotel with great service and large, comfortable rooms. Stayed here during construction and never heard anything. The walk in shower and separate large tub was nice. The bed was very comfortable. I highly recommend this property.Staff was extremely welcoming and provided excellent service. The room we stayed in was really clean and ac was perfect. The pool was very close to our room and had more than enough toiletries for 4 people. The bathroom and shower was awesome. The shower was in a little area next to the tub but was seperate. The only problem was the pool closing at 10 pm and security guy was not really nice about it. Other than everything was fabulous.I'm only putting 1 star because I can't put negative 5 stars which is what this place deserves. Someone deleted my long and detailed review that I left at the end of August. That's odd. Basically, this place sucks, the staff are young and inexperienced and there is never a manager on site to handle anything. The rooms are not that great and not that clean. The Hilton is waaaaaay better so I recommend going there next time in Sedona.A really nice hotel, turndown service, pool and fitness included. The only problem we had was occasionally with noise. Not sure if that was specific to the location in the hotel building, but it surely was annoying.","How this resort received [AAA] 4 diamonds is beyond comprehension. The service was dismal and at times, rude. Service aside, Sedona Rouge is a mid-priced gem in the desert (diamond in the sand?). My hunch is that the overall staff grew tired from serving guests coming in with daily deals.ROOMS: the standard room was a bit small given the $450/night busy-season rate but cozy and inviting. POOL: disappointing that this type of resort doesn't offer saltwater pools or spas. Also, no waiter service in the pool. What a shame of how much business they lost from people wanting to order drinks. SPA: It's a tiny spa. The $15 day pass isn't worth it...they don't even have a hot tub or pool. The lounge area is awkwardly small and uncomfortable due to the volume of people.  TV: who watches TV on vacation but we had a voucher for a pay-per-view movie. Not the best since they have HDTVs but without the HD setup. FOOD: breakfast was pretty decent. We had some sliders before dinner and they were terrible. Terrible to the point that  we didn't return on the second day even though we had vouchers for free appetizers.LOCATION: it's right on the main drag and close to everything (relatively speaking). Run out of wine? You can walk to Safeway that's literally steps away. Less than a 10-minute drive to a couple vortex sites. BATHROOM: this is worth mentioning. Even for the small standard room, the bathroom is gorgeous (again, keep in mind the price point). Dual showerheads including a ""rain"" showerhead above you. The shower is very spacious; you can easily git 10 people in there (mind out of gutter please). BAR: again, vouchers. Nothing to brag about to Dionysus. Service was unflattering. Again, how they received multiple 4-diamond awards is beyond my intellect.The hotel was nice and clean however based on travel website reviews the hotel was expected to be much nicer. For the price the hotel was not as nice as expected. The pool area was nice but small. No complimentary breakfast was offered. 20 dollar resort fee per day. The location was get nice with central access to all main tourist attractions!We had the perfect room, king suite with pool access. Literally we walked out our patio to the pool! The hotel was clean and the staff was efficient. Our small frig in our room didn't work and the air conditioning took a long time to get to the desired temp. Otherwise family and pet friendly, we traveled with 2 kids and our dog and it was perfect.Aside from the fact that this ""Resort and Spa"" is on an 'any road in America', commercial strip, I do not like the 'got-chya' resort fee charged without notice, upon checkout.Upon relaying my dislike of this underhanded revenue enhancement tactic with the GM, I received a canned response. You know, as if my comments were written in Hieroglyphics - "" I thank you for writing to us. We use your feedback to applaud our staff and improve where we can....."". Oy vey, please. Though a fairly nicely planned property, I'll take my $400/night somewhere else, thank you.Save your money; or spend it somewhere else.  Food at Reds was horrible.. The GM of the hotel's response was that most people like their food... Based on a nearly empty dining room on a Thursday, I'd say the locals don't like it either.  Rude at front desk and after checking out-- a week after--- 20.00 was added to the amount I signed for at  the front desk. Their response was that I should have known the correct rate.  I've been offered a lower rate and an upgrade if I give them another chance.. FAT CHANCE.  Bad service, Bad Food  and changing rates makes it NOT worth my time or money re-book at this hotel.The service here was excellent. Everyone was very professional and courteous. The facilities were fine. Coming from the Arizona Biltmore, the Rouge felt a little shabby but it was clean and comfortable on the whole. The heater was a bit loud and our tub was leaking. And there is this strangeness in the bathroom where the tub is next to AND inside the shower stall... Like I said though the friendly staff made up for a lot. The breakfast at REDS was pretty good. They gave us free breakfast for our two kids.Nine of us came out and booked 5 rooms for a long weekend ""retreat,"" and overall, we had a really good stay.  We had a Travelzoo deal that included massages, yoga and breakfasts.  Positives:Loved the small spa - great massages, nice teas, infused water, private outdoor hot tub, very friedly service.Room had a super comfy bed, wonderful shower w/ rain and regular showerheads, black out curtain liners for great sleep.Yoga was a great way to start the day - very relaxing and positve.The views - there are beautiful views of the red rocks right behind the hotel.  Observation deck - the deck has great red rock views if you look straight ahead, but right over to your left is a big Safeway in a strip mall, which detracts significantly from the tranquility of the views.The pool and jacuzzi - nice, relaxing, never crowded.  Would have a good red rock view, except that they built the 2-story spa behind it -- seems they could have designed that better.Negatives:The food at Reds - not good; we had free breakfasts w/ our package, but the food was not good, and neither was the service. They took our drink orders, but my tea never arrived; I ended up getting my own from the self-serve dispenser.The location - the location is good in that it's pretty central to everything, but not so good in that it's located right on the busy highway 89A, so you get the traffic noise. Wait staff - very inconsistent. One day by the pool we ordered small plates, and service was fast and friendly. But our first night there, we ordered a bottle of champagne on the observation deck; the server brought up warm champagne in an ice bucket, said we should wait 10 minutes to let it chill; added himself a 20% gratuity, said he'd be back to open the bottle for us, and never returned.Overall, the positives outweighed the negatives for me, and I did enjoy the hotel. Would I stay here again?  Not sure; I might try somewhere new, a little further off the beaten path, or the highway.I got a room here for less than $120 a night using the Hotel Tonight Ap. I am moving across country and stopping at on my bucket list destinations.  I checked in late but the staff let me use the small plate voucher even though it was only good for 4-6 pm. They froze my igloo ice packs from my cooler. My sweet puppy was sick from the drive and while I was eating on the patio at Red's, she got sick... they were totally understanding. The facility is clean, the staff is friendly...and when you are tired after a day of driving-- its worth it.Oasis in the desert! After endless research for a one night stay in Sedona, I chose this place and it did not disappoint! This boutique style hotel is further west from what we wanted to see and do but well-worth our stay. We arrived late Monday night (June 24) and we called to confirm our reservation and were pleasantly informed our room was ready and they were expecting us and to drive safely (windy drive).  Great attention to detail from everything from the bright orange leather headboard to the walk-in overhead rain-shower.  Aesthetically-pleasing. Posh. Plush and lush!My only gripe was the ""walk-on balcony."" The balconies are 2-3ft at most with a view of a lawn??? :/ The coffee in the room was sorry to say but cheap. I am sad we did not have enough time to experience the spa but the service menu is really inviting! There is a Safeway grocery store conveniently across the street.Sedona is a quiet town, had an older/retired community feel (we had no idea until we checked in). Everything closes at 9pm. This would be great for honeymooners/couples or people traveling on business. Would love to return here.Stayed a few nights in this boutique hotel on Rt89A. Very nice. We had a 3rd floor room overlooking the pool and the adjacent Safeway; thus the ""urban setting"" in the hotel promo blurb. Not a distraction however. Room was nicely appointed with cathedral ceiling and gas fireplace. Bathroom was big with oversized walk-in shower. Pool area was nice. Hot tub. Could have used more chairs. Pool side service from the bar. Another plus. Spa area was nice, but we didn't partake in any of the services. There's an observation patio on the roof of the restaurant with a fire pit for night time star gazing. Close to shopping and restaurants. ""Reds"", the house restaurant is a good choice. All in all, a pleasant experience. We'd stay there again.Great place.  Highly recommend it.  ask for a third story room facing the rocks.  made opening the blinds every morning awesome to see the coffee pot staring back.the free breakfast vouchers for the kids made their morning fun since we used room service- they don't get that type of treatment at home....didn't use the spa but the fitness room, pool and hot tub were pretty nice.  there was a lack of pool towels every day we were there so going to the front desk was really annoying.we were not expecting the $30/ nt resort charge and the 13% room tax when we checked out.I was ""assigned"" the hotel by Priceline. When I arrived, they took an imprint of my credit card for incidentals. A month later, a $40 charge (about 15% of my bill) shows up on my card as some kind of general  ""spa fee .""  They did not mention any such fee when they took my card.  Tacking on a surprising 15% to the room rate for nothing is ""gotcha"" to guests. I called, requesting a return call to talk to the appropriate manager. Still waiting for that call.  Chalk this up to poor customer relations.I've travelled around the world and been to many places that bill themselves as spa. Among the things they have in common are luxuriously appointed rooms, quality bath amenities (fine shampoos, soaps, etc),  great views, and a staff that bends over backwards. Sedona Rouge Spa has none of these, though its location next to a Safeway on the main road, does put it near a Starbuck's. Now I know why the ""spa"" seemed eerily empty during our stay.This is a pretty good option if you're not going to go nuts with one of the super opulent spas in town.All the basics are here.  Good sized rooms and nice beds.It's also located a little bit off the really crowded main area of Sedona which is nice.Great place and great views! Everyone was very helpful and nice. Love the huge shower!!I'll preface my review by mentioning that I rarely ever stay in hotels this nice - so consider the source. My favorite things about this hotel are the beds, the shower/tubs, and the view from the room.The beds are an experience of their own and one of the biggest ""pros"" of this hotel. The quality of the mattress, the sheets and the pillows is very five-star-worthy - super comfortable.Each room offers cozy Kashwere robes (one of Oprah's Favorite Things) and decor that is elegant and matches the Sedona scenery. I've stayed at this hotel twice and each room offered a different combination of shower/bath - both were amazing. The rain shower head is really neat but I prefer the bath! The tub is huge and is right by the windows in the room - it has temperature control and jets. Other perks: The curtains have 'black out' liner so you can sleep in total darkness, the soaps/shampoos are top notch, and they have a lighted make-up mirror (the magnification kind) in the bathroom. This hotel is very romantic and was perfect for an anniversary and then Valentine's getaway with my boyfriend. We thought it was worth the splurge so much we stayed twice. My least favorite things about this hotel (aside from price), would be the restaurant, the pool, and the staff service wasn't that great. I don't usually stay at nice hotels, but I guess I'd expect better service for $300+/night accommodations. The staff was just not that friendly or helpful and the service was lacking. However, I did like the e-mail confirmation for the room and recommend visiting the website and trying to browse deals/specials through their e-mail subscription service. While the amenities at this hotel are fun, I would probably have given 5-stars if there was a little more attention to detail. As a $300+/night hotel, I wouldn't expect to find little things like a broken thermostat unit, stains/tears in carpet, broken blinds, etc. - all of which were little dampers in our stay. I would absolutely NOT recommend ""Reds"" the restaurant, which is kind of a bummer, but it's worth a drive to eat somewhere else. It's very expensive and is definitely a huge let down! Very disappointing - in the service, long wait, and the quality of the food. We stayed in the Spa during our second visit for the tub-room but we didn't use the services, they look fun though!Just spent a couple days here for our honeymoon and have to say that we are happy with our experience. The balcony on the thirds floor does have a great view of the rocks and is a awesome place to have a drink and enjoy Sedona.The rooms are pretty big and very clean. Also loved the double shower heads.The room was great , the staff was timely and polite. The upsetting part was the random resort fee at check out. We booked the room through Expedia , we paid the room rate, taxes and fees...so we assumed that the room was paid for. I wouldn't mind paying the fee if it was clear and upfront  during booking that there would be one. The room was fine. but it was a little dated. I probably would not have forked over $170 a night instead of $150 which is what I thought I was paying. I mean, for $180, we could have stayed at the Hyatt . Just make sure they are clear with you on fees before you book here. Also if you aren't using the amenities, I wouldn't say it's worth staying at this ""resort"".This hotel was cute and the bed was comfortable. Nice little pool/jacuzzi area. Our room backed up to it and with a little patio area. The door to the patio worked with the room key, which was convenient. The bathroom had the most bizarre set-up we had ever seen: a shower behind a glass wall with a drain in the floor and a tub behind that. Worked fine, just super odd. Furnishings seemed a bit outdated but still pretty clean.This is a good hotel to stay like any other resort type hotels in Sedona. When checkin you can ask for rooms facing the mountain. ROOMS are small for the price paid and balcony is ""really Small""POOL: Very disappointing. Hot Tub was extremely HOT and people could not get in. Asked the waiter about this and as per him, that's how they do it  You will need to Pay for Breakfast. Bathroom was really big and very neat. Even though its free WIFI, when check out they add a Resort Fee which is $20/Day. This was not mentioned while booking or check-in. Very surprised to find out at the end.My review for this place is just for the spa. I think the resort is quite conveniently located , though not necessarily beautifully located. Its right on the streets so you arent overlooking the red rocks as much as the traffic going by. However, once inside it has the look and feel and sound of any regular spa. My aesthetician was good and gave a good facial. She recommended some products but wasnt salesy. I wish there was some more reading material in the waiting room but maybe im missing the point around switching off competely! :) Its also quite reasonably priced and I like that they have 30 min options as well. Overall a decent experience but maybe not on the list of 'go-to' place yet.","Enjoyed the Rouge and found it to be a good value for Sedona.  Very nicely appointed rooms with comfortable beds, nice linens, and great bathroom with rain shower.  Beautiful view from fitness room. Pretty pool area.  Nice roof-top patio.Hotel seemed understaffed (early October)--no bell staff visible, no one attending to people at pool or in patio.Enjoyed our stay here in Sedona.  The staff was friendly and accomodating, even letting us check in early.  The room was spacious and nice, great amenities and great view of the rocks.  The hotel was quiet and a great price for Sedona.The lounge had a nighly ""act"" who was quite superb, as was the food and drinks, also moderately priced for the area, which is always a good thing.Everything is just OK at this hotel.  The beds are good, the morning coffee is good and some rooms have a nice view.  Be careful with some other rooms because they are just right by the parking lot and with street view.  The service is what I don't think is up to par for a 4-star hotel.  For example, I called the spa to ask about a yoga class for my family.  The lady told me that they have a complimentary class every morning for hotel guests.  I go to sign up in the morning and the front desk person tells me that there is a charge per person for the class.  I told him what the spa has said and that I would be OK paying for 2 adults and see if he could do something for my two kids who had never taken yoga.  He said he would talk to the instructor.  At the end, I get charged for all 4 persons.  Anyway, the location is also just OK.  Close to stores and supermarket but not the main shopping street of Sedona.  I love Sedona but would look to stay someplace else next time.I love this hotel.My husband and I were going to get married here, and had put down a deposit. We decided to elope instead! Evidently, we misread the cancellation policy - our fault. The deposit is non-refundable. We had only paid half of a $2k deposit.As upset and frustrated as we were to possibly lose $1,000, we set off to plan our elopement. It was going to be in Sedona anyway. Once we stopped playing phone tag with the sales manager, Daniel, we ended up super happy campers. They heard the story that we just wanted to elope instead of plan a wedding and allowed us to use the 1kdeposit for our stay. They HEARD us, and adapted to our needs rather than try to get the full $2k deposit we had not paid yet. We would have had to stay somewhere anyway, and that saved us a lot of money on our total elopement, as we thought we'd have to shell out another 1k somewhere else!When we walked into our spa room, we were beyond excited. They had already laid out champagne and strawberries. The rooms were a perfect size for a couple. There was a jacuzzi bathtub in the ROOM as well, which was relaxing and wonderful. I got a spa treatment the same day I went there. I called and they were able to fit me in quickly, and give me exactly what I wanted. I got a full body wrap with facial, and was able to just walk right back up to my room to continue relaxing. The therapist was sweet, and did a wonderful job. The treatment rooms were warm, relaxing, and soothing. I could easily be a spa junkie with a treatment like this. I should have gotten another!!That night, it was chilly... But we went out to the rooftop terrace to see the stars and enjoy our wine. The staff upstairs was very accommodating and helped us get the fire going.They also gave us complimentary appetizers at REDS, but there wasn't much on the menu for a gluten-free vegetarian. No bother on me, as I'm used to it.We had a wonderful experience, and will definitely be back again. If you're into spas, the spa room is worth it!Expectations management is the name of the game with the Sedona Rouge.  If you look at their website or their glowing write-up on Jetsetter (through whom I booked), you would think this was a resort on par with a Four Seasons.  It isn't.  It's a very nice boutique hotel, on par with the Viceroy in Palm Springs.That having been said, once we realized we weren't staying at a resort (and glad we weren't paying full price), we were extremely pleased  with this chic, comfortable, well-located hotel with all the amenities.  Like the Viceroy and hotels of its ilk, great care was taken with the design and color scheme in this hotel.  Rich reds and Andalusian decor elements are throughout the property and it's just really pretty.The hotel occupies a small property in West Sedona on a busy main street.  It's in a commercial district, across the street from a minimall that contains a Safeway and a Petco.  Next door is a doggie day care and a pet grooming spot (which, since we were traveling with our dogs, we appreciated).   Our room was spacious and private, with a small patio in a grassy area that was perfect for us.  Dog waste bags are provided, and overall having dogs with us was a non-issue, which was really nice for an upscale hotel.  We were really pleased with how well-planned the dog areas are.  Because we were in a pet-friendly room, our room did not have vaulted ceilings or a rain shower, so if those are important to you, request a top floor room and leave the pets at home.One thing I always look for are the toiletries provided by the hotel, and the Sedona Rouge's line of lemon mint soaps and shampoos was refreshing and spa-like.  The robes are chenille-like and super, super plush.  The pool is small but when we were there, it was never once crowded.  The pool area is well-appointed with comfortable and commodious recliners and poolside service during the heat of the day.  There is a great workout room with treadmills, bikes, yoga mats and weights.  Every morning there is yoga!The spa was very nice -- small but it had everything you want in a nice spa (steam rooms, sauna, hot tub, showers with all the amenities) -- and I really had fun in the spa shop, which sells a variety of designer and locally-sourced bath and body items.  My husband and I both got two-hour long custom massages (in both our cases, a mix of hot stone, deep tissue, cranial and traditional Swedish) and we were sooooo pleased and relaxed.  Our therapists, Michel and Barbara, were very talented professionals.  I was pleased that a two-hour massage was an option, because not every spa offers it.If you want a massage and you're on a budget, next door (doggie day care side) is also the massage school for Northern Arizona, which provides inexpensive massages.  I didn't try it but I was tempted.REDS, the hotel restaurant, was solidly good.  The dining room was small but the bar area was spacious, and we enjoyed appetizers in the bar for dinner, which was a great way to keep the tab down bu still get a taste of the restaurant.  We liked the decadent crab dip and the Bloody Marys.  Finally, the property offers some hidden gems, like a medicine wheel by the spa, where you can pray or meditate and get your Sedona on, and a third floor observation deck, which is a great place to take a cocktail while you watch the sunset.its a decent place; nothing extraordinary but it was a normal, nice room.   the knock is that it's way overpriced. the $19 ""resort"" fee is ridiculous. it's essentially a scam to lure you to a lower initial price and stick you with hidden fees.  our front desk person, Raul, was very nice, but a few employees were kind of rude.Sedona Rouge is a good place to stay. Really, it is. Don't let the website fool you though because it's not opulent. My standing room only balcony had a view of the parking lot. The ""viewing deck"" is a great place to share a bottle of wine and to see what's going on at the Safeway next door.The rooms were very clean, the bed comfy, and the shower is large enough for two.Breakfast at the on-site restaurant, Reds, was always good. The daily yoga was a great way to start the morning and realize how uncoordinated I am.The spa facility was fairly large and the massage was relaxing, but once again, not opulent.The staff was always polite, the location is good, and I'd be happy to go back.There are many places to stay in Sedona keep looking!  The resort fee is ridiculous this is the farthest thing from a resort, not to mention food poisoning from their restaurant and a staff that is sure they are doing you a favor!  I have traveled for over 25 years for work and pleasure internationally and have never felt so compelled to write a review and warn people, Sedona is too special to have a negative experience and I am their frequently.Recently stayed at the Sedona Rouge Resort and it was fantastic. However, as others mentions, it's not truly a resort but rather a very nice boutique-y style hotel. We only stayed one night, but wish it had been longer. We had a king-bed one the top floor with the rain shower. Must say - the shower was a-mah-zing though between the two shower heads I kind of felt like I was drownding. Also enjoyed the complimentary toiletries - I'm a big fan of aromatherapy/natural shampoos and soaps and these smelled heavenly. The balcony wasn't really a balcony - i was expecting some chairs to sit and enjoy the views but its barely big enough for more than one person to stand out on. There is an observation deck above the pool but was closed due to a private event.Also visited REDS for drinks and breakfast - it was a little toasty at as the heat was turned on (it wasn't even that cold and I'm from Texas!). In the morning I had a simple breakfast but enjoyed it. The service, as with the whole stay, was great. Unforunately, I did not get to try the spa as I had recently gotten a facial/massage at home.Overall, enjoyed my time in Sedona and at the Sedona Rouge - I will def. go back.We spent 3 nights here and it was perfect. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Spa served up great massages for my girlfriend and I. The location is central and close to all the action. The only thing that could have made this place 5 stars is if we had a better view (we had one of the parking lot). Definitely recommend to others!  Thanks, Sedona Rouge!Using a great Travel Zoo deal, we stayed for two nights in the beginning of our honeymoon. The deal included spa treatments and breakfast.  I think because we got a great deal, they stuck us near the highway with no view. What up wit dat?! The room was nice but nothing too impressive. The highlight was the smell of the soap. LOL. Spa treatment was outstanding...one of the best I've gotten...the hot rock treatment was cool...my first time. We almost had a scheduling snafu but they made up for us by offering us some free massage oils and teas to take home.The low point - On our first night...tired from traveling...we order room service. We called back to ask for a second set of silverware....they told us to come to the restaurant to get them! WTF! What's the point of room service, if I have to go to the restaurant. They said they'd deliver the silverwear in 20 minutes...WHATEVER! My new bride and I shared silverwear and of course, the 2nd set never came.For your honeymoon...go to L'aubergeLow key and well staffed newer facilities and fair pricing.  Small but still feels big so you get the benefits of a larger Spa without having to compete with lots of other guests while you're using hot tubs steam room and lockers.  Etc.  Incredible massage. Fair price.  I will be coming back.Disappointed in checking in. Had booked hotel a month in advance with specific requests. Upon checking in I was given a handicapped accessible room which I had NOT requested because I don't have the need for one and don't feel right taking one, not to mention it wasn't what met my travel needs. I don't park in handicapped spots! I talked with the office staff and was told there was nothing that could be done. I found it ironic that they were not willing to help rectify the situation (they had caused) as I looked at their awards for customer service. Really? Completely disappointed for my return trip to Sedona. If you're wondering where to stay go to the Amara. Customer service and accommodations outshine this place.I agree with Brian K.'s review somewhat.The hotel and spa were great. But as far as the dining staff is concerned, if the GM had a brain, these people should be fired. The day we got there we settled in and went to the pool patio to have lunch. We were treated like as if we disrupted their quiet afternoon. After sitting down and ordering a burger and chips with salsa and 2 beers, which by the way took longer than it should, considering there was no one else around. Our waiter came with the food, with no napkins and 2 warm beers. My wife asked for a glass of water to which he turned around and pointed at a cooler sitting 2 tables away. Really, are you gonna make us get up and walk to get water? And $4.50 for 10 ounces of warm beer is a bit much. After the meal, our waiter was no where to be found. We waited for about 10 minutes before he came out from wherever, and I asked for the check, to which he didn't have, so we waited again for him to return. Looking at the lunch bill I noticed they included a 20% service/gratuity charge for eating poolside. Needless to say, that's all this lame waiter got. You give someone crappy service, well you're getting a crappy tip.And that evening we went to the bar to use our drink voucher. The bartender was sub par as well. She seemed annoyed we presented her with this voucher that the HOTEL GAVE US!I ordered a margarita and boy was I disappointed. I could hardly stand to drink it. I took one drink and left it. My wife ordered a mojito and that was ruined as well.It seemed to us that in a small tourist town like this that the staff would go the extra mile to make you feel welcome. I mean 90% of the people there were tourist and spending tourist dollars, which I assume keeps this town afloat. Groupon or not, money is money, and this hotel got very little extra from me.I went here with my best friends and I kept comparing this place with Burke Williams and I really shouldn't do that. This place is a hotel/spa place so I really can't compare it to a place that is specifically a spa place. The staff (aside from the receptionist) were super friendly. I got a Classic Swedish Oil Massage and it was so good; made me so relaxed (not just the feeling of being relaxed, but it just completely relaxed my whole body). Then I got a facial and that was just so...interesting. They tell you what they are about to do and apply to your face...and it's no lie. One part of the facial just feels like my face is on fire...too much senses going on for me. The lobby was a decent size for being a hotel/spa place. The shower area was a bit small. The steam room is small. The spa area was decent (I guess in terms of size). Extra towels and such were always restocked. The room where you get your services are big. There was plenty of pace and it was clean and organized.I just visited Sedona and this hotel last weekend with my wonderful girlfriend. The hotel was very nice, clean and spacious. We both agreed that we felt as if we were in a nice house in Sedona versus a hotel room. The appetizers were probably good but I didn't find anything I liked on the menu. The breakfast was perfect. Service was great especially by an older gal who was super sweet. She seems to run the place pretty well. She attended to our needs even if the other servers weren't. The one thing we could not get there was a glass of water. I don't know if water is scarce in Sedona or what but that was our predicament. We went to Oak Creek in some Indian named village I cannot remember, say or spell. Food was moderate. Kinda cold and beers were average. Just wasn't for us. The service at the hotel was perfect. They called a ""Quick Ride"" cab. Steve was our guy. Very nice and accommodating. ""Quick Rides, this is Steve."" They were there where we were quickly. However, make sure you need the ride because it is a flat rate so make sure the place you are going is far enough and be safe with your drinking decisions. I don't know how far the 15$ rate goes however. We took it anyway! The shower in the room was very impressive, nice view and great for drinks before dinner! All in all I loved Sedona and this hotel. Breakfast was cramped next day for checkout early in the AM and tempers were high, but everyone got served in a timely manner. But, gota say my company made my trip. Thank you Sedona Rouge!Enjoyed our stay here.  The staff were really nice and the place looks great.  We didn't eat there because the restaurant was too pricey for our tastes and they didn't seem to have many healthy or veggie options.  But it was close to everything, so we got take out from Picasso's Italian and brought it back to the room to eat and have wine in our warm cozy room.  The price was good, they had yoga in the morning, and everything was great.  I highly recommend this place.  It is like a hotel and not like a resort even though they do have a spa.  Maybe in the summer when you can walk around and enjoy the pool it will feel more like a resort, but in winter we basically hung out in the room or on the trails.I booked a 4 star hotel through priceline. NOT a Priceline auction.....a priceline ""Express Deal"" where they offer an unnamed hotel in 4 stars in Sedona for 150 a night........When I get there, they try to put me in the worst room they have and when I refuse to stay in a room with 3 sides to hallways....the guy says ""well, you booked on priceline"".....I'd rather stay in the best room of a 3 star than the crappiest room in a 4 star. It didn't say ""we'll sell you a crap room for $$---."" It said that there was a 4 star available at 150 a night (and don't forget the resort fee $20) so it should have said that you can eat sh*^) for $170 a night. but we'll give you the second floor looking at trees that you can't see through for an additional 20 and a room with a reasonable view but homes that are right there looking in your windows for 20 more. Look, there are only a couple rooms that have a view in this place. You don't go to Sedona to have a ""view"" room overlooking the pool. You especially don't book a 4 star in Sedona to look at a pool or have 3 of your rooms walls in hallways.  A terrible example of what you should expect for your money.  There are so many good places to stay in Sedona. This wouldn't be in the top 20. Add in the ""better than you"" attitude and this place should be bankrupt in a short period of time.I had an amazing time at the Sedona Rouge. It's a great hotel, and most importantly, everyone who works there is incredibly nice. I would highly recommend it.Things Sedona Rouge does well: * Clean, well-appointed rooms. A bit overpriced in my opinion ($220), but I realize we are in the busiest season for tourists. * Smaller, but nice pool area. It was a beautiful day in Sedona to hang by the pool. So we did...for an hour or so before our Pink Jeep picked us up at the hotel. * Reds, the hotel restaurant. We enjoyed a few appetizers in the afternoon and headed back for dinner that evening. We had an amazing meal and dessert was a fabulous way to end the night. (Review for Reds to follow). I would return to Sedona Rouge again, most likely in the off season.","I can't say enough good things about this place - I've been back 2x in the past 2 months and can't wait for the next trip! Our recent stay was upstairs in a room overlooking the pool and Safeway - mostly safeway - but still had a balcony and some mountains in the view. The shower was incredible- rain shower head &amp; regular one - great for sharing! Fireplace - not needed this time of year, but ideas for when we come back and valted ceilings &amp; comfy beds!Sean at the pool brought us ice water and offered snacks and drinks for a fee - very nice - Food a Reds Sunday morning was great - the boytoy loved the chilikiles (I can't spell)  - Highly recommend!Just got back from a trip to Sedona and booked a one hour massage appointment with the Sedona Rouge Spa, along with my mother in law and sister in law. We showed up early morning for the (optional) yoga class to sort of ""get in the calm"" before an hour of enjoying the hot tub and steam room. The ""waiting room"" (where you sit in your fluffy robes before being called into your appointment) was clean and quiet, and a variety of fresh fruit, teas and lemon water was available to us. After our massages we regrouped and all of us reported very positive non-cookie cutter massage experiences. I will definitely be back! Plus we scored a great winter special, so if you're visiting in the off season, make sure to look into those!  Lastly my therapist's name was Giri (pronounced Gary) and she was excellent! She used a variety of different massage modalities and had strong hands and a very intuitive touch. She clearly has LOTS of experience. And being in November, there were some winter specials in effect, so keep that in mind if you're visiting during the winter months.My wife arranged this as a birthday trip for me. She talked to almost every hotel in town and was telling the names as we rolled by into the town. But, THESE GUYS ARE GREAT.I have had a fabulous birthday. There is a great spiritual significance to the place as it lies right next to the Heart Chakra. You can see that Heart setting in stones very beautifully set right outside the compound. No wonder, the staff are super friendly and very nice. We loved the whole experience from the concierge on the phone prior to arrival, the front desk, the bellman, the housekeeping, the spa... OMG, and ofcourse the Reds restaurant. That is pretty much where we ate all the 3 days.Tips: Look up Luxury Link and you will get a great combo kind of deal, where you get lots of goodies like food at Reds, Spa, Yoga and welcome drinks all wrapped into it... and most of all the rooms with the most amazing view facing the Red Rocks. You cant beat that.We Stayed here and really enjoyed it! We got a couples massage at the Spa and it was wonderful! They also have restaurant that we ate at and was pretty good! They have a nice fitness center as well.Great stay here. Location was really nice...you could walk to the market next door, the foods at reds was awesome! But the customer service was where they really excelled!The Sedona Rouge gets its high marks mostly for the outstanding staff. Robin the Concierge knows everything about Sedona and is very thorough, Nikki and Steven at the front desk were extremely helpful. My wife mentioned in passing that it was our 20th anniversary when she was making arrangements and there was a bottle of champagne and strawberries in our room when we checked in. Thank You! The rooms are appointed very nicely and the beds were extremely comfortable. The Spa is professional but not pretentious. The hotel even has a rooftop lounge where we went to look up at the Sedona night sky and we were able to see meteors. The hotel itself is in West Sedona and is close to everything but removed enough from the Uptown area that becomes crowded with tourists. Although we did not have a chance to experience Reds, the restaurant, it offers compliementary coffee and tea for guests and it appeared to be a lively place for dinner and live music. Staying at the Sedona Rouge made our inaugural trip to Sedona a very pleasant experience and we hope to stay there again on future return trips!I'm glad I read reviews on this hotel because they helped my expectations.  It is a nice place--definitely not a dive. It is not a Four Seasons or a posh spa resort, but for the price---it is well worth it.  Service is pretty good. People are courteous. The spa is very good (Peter and Justin are probably the best massage therapists in the world!).  It is a pretty place.  Like many other hotels in Sedona, Sedona Rouge is located along a main street/highway so there is noise pollution. So we choose a room away from the road and it was well worth it.  Also we had a great view of the amazing Red Rocks. If we return to beautiful Sedona, we would definitely return here.I stayed at the Sedona rouge over the Valentines Day weekend and REALLY enjoyed my stay. It started with Matt who booked my reservation and really helped me put together everything I wanted including the wine tour. i also have to give kudos to Cierra, the concierge, who took care of restaurant reservations and gave some wonderful recommendations for breakfast. The hotel itself was really nice and relaxing, I loved the the huge rainfall shower head in the shower. I highly recommend reds restaurant. Ate there twice and recommend the scallops and the seafood bisque.....YUM. If you are in Sedona and want to stay at a stylish place with fantastic accommodations then the Sedona Rouge is the spot.We loved our stay at Sedona Rouge. We booked a king bed room with Red Rock views and loved it. The service was great, the staff was very helpful and I loved the spa. My husband and I got a couple's massage, and loved the experience. We also didn't feel that we spent too much on too little. All in all, a great experience.Great resort...and they allow pets...which is a HUGE bonus.It was very clean and boutique-y. The front desk staff are extremely helpful and will go out of their way to satisfy whatever need you may have.The bed was ridiculously comfortable with a nice fluffy down comforter...you sink right into the bed. The flat screen is also a nice touch (just an fyi...on the ppv movies the volumes is very low. we had to strain to hear even with the volume turned all the way up)The bathrooms have a nice shower and bathtub. Only problem here...the shower is like a half glass wall. It ""looks"" very cool....but when you take a shower the water seems to go everywhere. Overall....great place...we got a fabulous deal which made it even better :)I want to give this place 3 1/2 stars, but it's getting four for service.  I didn't feel that the entire place was worth what we paid - there weren't any amazing views and the Reds restaurant was alright, had breakfast there, not bad.  What really helped was that the staff were VERY sweet and communicative and helpful.  They are truly what makes this hotel wonderful.  I even forgot my glasses and they found them and will soon be shipping them to me via UPS (charged to my credit card).We had a funny schedule and wanted to go to the spa so they helped us find a schedule that would accomodate our needs.  Very pet friendly and had a nice area for the dogs (all on the first floor) - there is a $50 pet cleaning fee.The room was a bit small (but we just came from a bed and breakfast where the rooms were big), the bathroom was really nice with a tub and shower combo unlike other hotels.  The water pressure was GREAT!!The location of the spa resort is also wonderful, we were very close to scenic drives and Cathedral rock and lots of hiking trails.  The front desk staff helped us figure out where to go and they can definitely help you put together a day of fun activities, no matter what your budget. :)The Spa - My friend and I booked spa treatments and they have a very nice facility - with lockers, showers, steam rooms and his/her jacuzzi's.  The massage was a wonderful way to end the trip.Just came back from a 2 night stay here. The hotel is nice and in a great location with beautiful views. However, a couple of issues with our room: it was DARK. I am not old, do not wear glasses, yet felt like i needed a flashlight.  I get they were trying to create ambiance, however when i leave wearing 2 different colored socks i know there is a lighting problem.  Also, the heater was ridiculously loud, so loud we had to shut it off to sleep and woke up freezing (it's cold in the desert!).  We did try the spa out there and had terrific massages so that was a plus and the restaurant was great for dinner as well.We love this place and come here at least twice a year. The service is great, the staff remembers us and it is dog friendly. The Reds has good food and the spa is great. The only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is that it is not smoke-free and it is a bummer to be sitting at the pool and have people smoking by you.My husband and I stayed at the Rouge for a one night special advertised via Travelzoo that included a one night stay, two spa treatments, yoga and breakfast at REDS. The room was clean and very nicely decorated, the bed was nice and comfortable plus coffee, tea and a refrigerator are part of the room amenities. The Front desk staff was very nice but not super chipper, so I have to agree with the previous comments on this page. The spa amenities are okay, not a place to really hang out to relax. I had a Swedish massage by Allen and he was one of the best therapists I have ever had!!!! Yoga was also a great experience and a great way to start the day, however 8AM was a bit early and I would have preferred a 9AM class instead. REDS restaurant for breakfast was pretty good and I have to say that the bloody mary I ordered was fantastic and the eggs benedict were also very good. Overall I would definitely stay at the Rouge again provided that there are special rates available, as I think the resort at it's regular rate is a bit over prized. On a side note, if you are looking for a great place to go for dinner that is in walking distance check out the Barking Frog :)Awesome! The hotel was in the perfect location in town, with every thing just a mile in every direction. They set us up with a exellcent tour of the vortex's. And the package we got was reasonable.The rooms were clean and well decorated. My  massage was fab, the spa rocked. The lobby had a beautiful water feature with lit columns and tables.My only regret was not asking for a room with a view. I will just have to do that next time!We just got back from a 3-night stay over New Year's weekend, and overall we enjoyed the Sedona Rouge and its amenities very much. This is the second time we've come here - last year we came over Christmas, and also enjoyed the hotel and really everything.First the positives:  the rooms were delicious - wonderful beds, wonderful bedding, warm and fuzzy towels, and great robes.  And, with the curtains closed, it felt like midnight at 10 in the morning! Also, at least for me, the room seemed almost sound-proof. Our kids, who were in a separate room two doors down, said that the sound of the fountain in the courtyard kept them up at night. But that sound barely registered for me - it was just white noise that helped me sleep really well!  Their bath soap is wonderfully ginger-scented, and while I usually avoid the lotions and shampoo, etc., at Sedona Rouge it was all really very nice.The maid staff and the staff at the hotel restaurant, Reds, were fantastic. Very efficient, very thorough, very courteous. (The food at Reds was also very good this time around. Last year we were kind of disappointed by the food at Reds, but this time around, it was really very good and we were pleased.) Other staff were also helpful - the bellboys brought ice to the room, Mike at the front desk was wonderful when he checked us in and helped us get additional keys when the kids locked their keys in their room. He also shared information on great hikes in the vicinity and was friendly and helpful.Also, the hotel is dog friendly, which is incredible. Poop bags provided all over the grounds, no complaints about the dog barking or her presence at all, no difficulty checking her in. Of course we pay for it, but still.... not all hotels are as helpful about dogs, especially nice hotels like the Sedona Rouge.Now for the downside: the young woman who served as concierge on the day we arrived and departed, and another young woman who checked us out, were less than courteous. I don't want to say rude -- and they were efficient and helped us accomplish what we needed to accomplish -- but for a bill like the one we paid at the Sedona Rouge, it would have been nice to hear, ""Thank you for staying with us,"" or ""Have a nice trip home,"" or even just ""Thank you."" They were both pretty much silent in every way except in the specifics of the transaction. They weren't friendly.  Again, not rude per se, but not friendly, either.  I noticed the issue with the attitude of the concierge at the beginning of our stay, but it didn't effect me too much. However, as we were leaving and especially as I had just signed a huge credit card authorization, it REALLY struck me at how un-courteous the office staff member was during the check out. I almost asked for the manager, but decided that I would call the manager once I got home instead. That's my next step...My boyfriend and I were road tripping from east coast to west in the fall, and we were most excited to break up our journey with a two-night stay at Sedona Rouge. I've stayed here before and loved it then, and it didn't disappoint this time around either. The room was clean, spacious and airy with a balcony that overlooked the red rocks. The toiletries smelled wonderful and were of good quality; the decor was desert-themed, but not too kitschy; and the grounds were beautifully kept. We especially loved unwinding in the hot tub to star-gaze after a long day of hiking--and the water was prickly hot, which I love! Though the location is not entirely walkable to Sedona's main drag, we didn't mind in the least since we prefer to visit busy areas in the day and come back to a quieter area at night. (Could be problematic if you don't have a car, but there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance and you could just cab it to the main part of town.) As for the spa, I appreciated its Ayurvedic approach to wellness and indulged in a customized body wrap. Loved it. For breakfast in the hotel's restaurant, I had a crispy, corn flake-battered French toast that was delicious. I continue to recommend this place to friends and family, and I look forward to staying here again whenever I have the urge to escape to the desert!I Just stayed at the Sedona Rouge Hotel and Spa for the third time in about 5 years, and once again it was wonderful! The staff is so friendly and accommodating, the rooms are immaculate and have every amenity you can think of or want. And this hotel has the most comfortable beds you may ever sleep on!Sexy, but not trashy sexy.  As befit our one-year anniversary trip.Loved that we could go outside directly from our room and overlook the beautiful courtyard.  The bed was nice, the pillows were marvelous, and the staff was friendly.  A bottle of champagne was waiting for us when we arrived!  A magnificent table lamp that I would have totally jacked if it fit in my suitcase.  The restaurant was decent (see that review), but they close at 9!The only minuses: no room service; mirror set too far back from the sink (how am I supposed to do my makeup?); a shower hook that I had no way of reaching from the shower because I'm not in the NBA.I have not stayed at this hotel yet, however I had a very nice customer service experience with Wendye Mox today.  The room I requested was not available the weekend of my stay.  She took the time to rearrange a few things, and was able to get me into the room I requested!  If the customer service at the hotel is all this great, I'm sure my stay will be a delight.","['beautiful', 'wonderful', 'trip', 'extra', 'fees', 'place', 'charges', 'booked', 'nights', 'almost',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-sedona-resort-and-spa-sedona,Hilton Sedona Resort & Spa,3.5,$$$,123,"Nice property, great location, comfortable, and courteous staff. After reading some of the Yelp reviews, I was worried this place would be disappointing. However, we had a great stay. Early checkin, late checkout was no problem.  Room was clean and comfortable with decent linens. Gas fireplace in room looked nice but flame was ok. Has kitchen area with refrigerator, microwave, and coffee. I had to call room service for some bowls and spoons since plates, utensils are not in room.Excellent concierge was very helpful with maps and suggestions of must see areas. Resort has pools, and large gym. Definitely would stay here again.Not thrilled with the snooty staff. As long as we don't need anything, the stay is fine. Ask the front desk for anything and you'll feel.....less than. We arrived back to the room to find both of our keys demagnetized.  WE KNOW BETTER THAN TO PUT THEM NEXT TO OUR PHONES.  The lady at the front desk was not polite in correcting the issue and insisted, needlessly really, that we must have put them with our phones. We weren't asking for a reason why, we just needed to get into our room. I just think that they could have been more courteous from the time we checked in to now, we still have two nights to go. I hope they can change my mind. It's a nice property and a special week for me and my husband. The restaurant is good, mixed feelings on some of the staff there as well.Maybe we aren't ""resort material"".  Don't let this review discourage you from staying, it is nice and it is convenient. I just think there's an unwritten bias somewhere in the fine print that we didn't read.Stayed here for an extended friends weekend! All I can say is this place is top notch! The staff was all friendly, courteous and there to help! ALICE at the front desk went above and beyond to help us with a difficult situation! She is warm, inviting and made us want to come back for another visit!  If you are staying here definitely ask for her! She will not disappoint. The views, pool, spa, and restaurant all were amazing. We will most definitely make this our stop when we come back to Sedona!Cool nice resort, interesting decor thou.  Very modern in the lobby, but not so much for the rooms.  That doesn't mean the room wasn't nice, it was and thankfully not as modern (cold design) as the lobby.  Great view from our room, quiet and loved the suite (think small apt)$698 for 2 nights....This is not a Resort or Spa.   There are no amenities, there was no service,  the fire pit is infested with roaches at night.   The restaurant staff did little to welcome us even though there was 1hr &amp; 15 min. before restaurant closed. The hallways were littered with dead insects in the morning and when I informed my concerns with Daniel at the front desk he did little to change my mind.  In his defense he was polite, but was not the manager. The decor and HOTEL....NOT RESORT OR SPA is beautifully designed.  Non Service for price and false advertising was my issue.   ROACHES did not help either.  STAY AWAY.We stayed here for a company retreat in mid July. The service at this hotel was terrible.  Several people in our group called ahead to see about early check in. (They Absolutely will not allow early check-in and check in is not until 4 PM) I went in at 3:35 to see if  I could get my room, there employees at two of the desks- but only one was assisting people. There was only one couple in front of me and it still took 15 minutes.  She told me our room was not ready, but she could get me pre-checked in and call when my room was ready- but it would be ready no late than 4 PM- which was 10 minutes away at that point.  4 PM rolls around, no room. 4:30 rolls around no room. I had to go up and complain when I saw other people from our group getting their rooms, and she finally assigned one to me.The room was fine- we had a suite with a kitchenette.  There were a lot of doors separating the areas, which we really liked, so you weren't stuck laying around in a dark room when the other person is sleeping.   However there were a lot of bugs. Okay by a lot- we probably saw 7-8 in our room during our 3 night stay, they were mostly dead you could tell- but still disgusting. If you didn't wear shoes you were likely to step on one. One of the people in our group was given a dirty room, with dishes and dirty sheets at the door- She was not happy about that- especially after waiting all day to check in. The service was just terrible all around. One of the girls in our group was having trouble connecting to the wifi and called down to the front desk and the lady told her its easy and she should be able to figure it out then hung up on her.  She then took her computer down to get help- because she couldn't find where to put in the code and the woman just looked at her screen and told her that's right and went back to what she was doing. We had asked the concierge for suggestions for a few dog friendly hikes in the area- and she only would give us one suggestion, which was frustrating since we all know the area decently well and wanted something other than extremely well known popular hikes. During our buffet dinner on site at the hotel- the staff was very rude. They ran out of chips for the appetizers early on and when asked if they were going to put out any more the response was 'this is all that was paid for'. 1) They are chips. 2) There is a much better way of putting it- ""This is all we have for this portion of the meal, but the main course will be available shortly.""The food was terrible anyway, I tried a bite or two of most everything they served and couldn't eat any of it.  They had a creme brulee cheesecake for dessert, it was runny and raw in the middle, and the topping was soggy. We also had to go get or room keys re coded every day because they would stop working for our rooms. It was extremely annoying, there was no reason for the keys to be deactivated. When we went to check out it was a hassle as well,  the company was paying for 2 nights of the stay and subsidizing the third night.  They people working the desk could not figure it out. They told us at first we had no charges, then they looked somewhere else and told us we owed for the full stay, we old them the company paid for the 2 nights, and then half of the 3rd, and they tired to charge us for a full night for the 3rd night, we had to argue with them until they figured it out. We were the first of our gorp to check out- so hopefully they had it figured out by the time the other 15-20 people in our group that stayed the additional night were checking out. All in all it was terrible. We were treated like we were an inconvenience to them, and we should not be interrupting their business or day. We absolutely will not stay here again.I always stay at a Hilton property but this one doesn't live up to the name.You walk in and it looks great but the rooms are not well kept, the bars and other places to grab food are not worth your time, and the gym if fine if you way to pay a resort charge of $18 on top of the 13 you already have to pay.Bottom line not worth the money here. In Sedona lots of other options.Spa is cold in the room where they hold classes, and the tennis courts are not usable most of the time due to the surface when wet!In 15 years of visiting I've never stayed here and I honestly don't know why. It is a great hotel and the nicest one I've stayed in in Sedona. The complimentary head and neck massage when you arrive is fabulous. The rooms are great, the outdoor fire pit is great and the restaurant will happily give you wine glasses to use with your own bottle of wine. The food is way overpriced and there are other good places to eat, so I didn't eat in the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel.I seldom write reviews on my hotel stays, but this was such an unpleasant  experience,  I felt I have to let others know: I stayed there this pass Saturday night, Sunday morning, I went for a hike at the Bell Rock, got back to hotel at 10am, asked ""Daniel"" at the front desk if I can check out at 12pm instead of 11:30am, so I have enough time to shampoo and shower without being rushed. His reply was ""NO"" , the parking lot was almost empty, most guest checked out, 30 minutes was not alot to ask for on a Sunday morning. When I asked to speak to the front desk manager,  Daniel  said manager will not be in until later, there is no manager on duty. Seriously?  Was I in a Hilton Resort? I left my name and number to have manager contact me, I wanted to bring this to his/her attention.  Sadly, 5 days later, no one called me. Good bye Hilton.What a lovely surprise to discover Sedona's breathtaking beauty surrounding this location!We arrived and were checked in promptly by the super efficient staff.  As requested, our room was ready early and on the ground floor, conveniently located near the ballroom for the Chopra Center event we were attending. Our room was equipped w a mini kitchenette, living area and separate bedroom in the southwest style.All was well - until we got to the actual bed quite late that evening and realized it had a sagging mattress and dip in the middle, so our first night was quite uncomfortable and restless for us both.We had a courteous conversation w the helpful manager on duty, Delia Enriquez, before our course began early the next morning and surprise!  Delia handled the issue quickly and the staff completely changed out the bed for us while we were in the morning session - terrific service without having to move from our lovely room.  Hurray!I've always said the measure of a great company is NOT how they handle people, situations or circumstances when things are great but rather how they handle challenges and difficulties for a peaceful equitable resolve.  Hilton did a wonderful job and we deeply appreciate that.The food that night was quite enjoyable in the hotel restaurant and service excellent as well as the following morning. The double bacon spinach omelets we ordered were rich and tasty, and the restaurant had a spectacular outdoor view to the surrounding Red Rock mountains, truly breathtaking.A shout out to the wait staff who took care of the Chopra event folks (while a smaller group than usual - normally around 450 of us attending, there were around 150 attendees plus the Chopra speakers and team) - they were flawless!  Thanks particularly to Maria and Josh, pleasant, funny, kind and so helpful.I would have given 5 stars to this location except for a couple of small things.  Our last day we had a meal in the restaurant.  My husband, a native Texan, is quite particular about his beef and his ordered medium rare bacon cheeseburger was well done to burnt in places.  We had to head on to Phoenix so no time to reorder a replacement.We had requested a delayed checkout w time to complete packing since our event ran long but the reception staff was not particularly understanding or helpful.  While courteous, it was clear they weren't interested in finding a solution, which is off putting and a small sour note in our enjoyable Sedona visit.  While we totally understand check-in and check out times are usually quite hectic for the staff of these busy hotels, we only needed a few extra minutes to finish up and it was refused...it's important for them to be aware of conversations w guests who like us.  We base our assessments of these properties on every detail, including how the staff handle the unexpected.We didn't have time to go back to the manager on staff on our departure day - instead we hurriedly packed up to accommodate their requirement for us to check out promptly and then had a 40 minute wait due to the lengthy checkout lines - ironic, since if they HAD accommodated our request, we would have had the requested extra time.  So we went to the restaurant and mike had his crunchy crispy burned burger.  :(((((Overall we would totally stay here again, with more time and less departure stress for all involved.This hotel was mediocre at best. The decor looks great when you walk in, but if you make a wrong turn down certain hallways, you will feel like you stepped back in time and into a scene from The Shining. It was weird. The staff at the front desk and at the bar/restaurant were totally rude and mostly unhelpful....The customer service here was really atrocious. What is really strange (especially for a town that makes most of it's money on tourism) is that we found the business owners and workers at most places we visited in Sedona to be really unfriendly and rude. Anyway, back to the hotel....our room was pretty big and had a great view. The bad parts....well, the shower leaked so badly I nearly slipped and fell while getting out...not safe for kids at all! Also, I've never stayed in a hotel room that had so many doors! Weird design flaw. There were so many rooms under construction, with banging and tools being used as early as 8am. So inconsiderate for the guests in the nearby rooms. I would never stay here again, mostly because of the horrible customer service....and that darn leaky shower....you wouldn't believe how it flooded the bathroom!One positive...this hotel is right up the street from an awesome restaurant called Cucina Rustica (owned by the same people that own Dahl &amp; DiLuca)...super good and pretty much the only nice waitress we had in Sedona!!!I am a Hilton Diamond member so purchased this stay with points. This includes $27 credit for breakfast - essentially two continental buffets (no warm food).  We were upgraded to a view of the Red Rocks which was great!  There are two pool areas. One is supposed to be the quiet, adult option of the two but it felt a little dated. The hot tub is also right next to the breakfast area so not a ton of pool privacy. The other pool is much larger but also extremely packed during the day.  We used our free coupons at the pool bar and I wouldn't recommend the margaritas. The room itself was nice with a decent amount of space, but a little dated as well. The shower design is awful and leaks water all over the floor every morning. Just something to watch out for! I really liked the location but you are a bit of a drive from the local Sedona attractions. It worked well for us though! Again, I paid with points and I do not think I'd recommend this hotel for the price they were charging when I booked.  I also had a random room charge on my bill which I'm not looking forward to dealing with this week - hopefully the customer service improves a bit.We were tired and this place was close. It was spendy. However, you get what you pay for. Pizza and the fish tacos were awesome. We ordered the flourless cake to go and were disappointed in how small it was, but pleasantly surprised how wonderful it was!!On arrival Julie got us checked in and helped us arrange a couples massage for the morning. We freshened up and met Jacob, who enthusiastically shuttled us to our restaurant at a speedy but delightful 9mph. Dinner at Cucina Rustica Sedona was fabulous! Our waitress was a gem and the staff made sure we wanted for nothing! The restaurant even called our escort Jacob to drive us back to the hotel. Truly Jacob was a very kind, polite, family oriented, pro-military man and his gentle nature and easy conversation made the 7mph ride (going up hill) very enjoyable. My husband and I set the temperature, started the fireplace and slept soundly throughout the night.Upon morning we showered, dressed and took advantage of the breakfast buffet. Jesus, our waiter was a big guy with a even bigger smile that could light up any room. He made sure that everything was made to order and that I was fully informed of which foods would effect my allergies. After breakfast he offered to walk us to the spa, but his directions were all that we needed. Spa - OMGoodness! These ladies had hands blessed by God! My husband and I melted into the tables and the stress of driving cross country soon became a faint memory. Afterwards they suggested 5 minutes in the hot tub or sauna. Well next thing I know my husband is texting me from the sauna saying that I had to try it (and he rarely says that to me)! So I took his advice and spent 10 glorious minutes stretching, sweating and talking to a beautifully seasoned woman about her spa membership. A quick shower later - My clothes felt like Egyptian cotton against my skin! Oh my life is indeed full of unexpected blessings! I turned in my locker key, and was able to purchase face wash and toner that I left at the previous hotel. My only suggestion, have more travel size items available.Upon checkout Chris made sure our receipt was correct and reflected our military family package, which we appreciated her taking the time to make sure everything was in order.All and all, this Hilton was well worth venturing off the 40 to experience! La Via Hilton Sedona!Situated well away from the hustle of Sedona, you get beautiful views and nice greeters welcoming you. Parking is very limited but we seemed to find a free spot. Room was nice and clean and very appealing but to find that the toiletries were not in place was the first drawback of more to come. Went downstairs to the pool and it was very family friendly. The poolside food and bar had a decent choice of drinks and fair but incredibly slow service. Non hotel guests attending seminars are slightly annoying asking for favors letting them into the pool area to relax around the water. Ordered breakfast and it was limited in choice and expensive. Coffee was of the military caliber, horrible. Was impressed with the presentation and taste of my waffle with chorizo and over easy eggs until I flipped the egg to find what appeared to be dog hair on my eggs. Picture is posted. Deserves a 1 and half star rating.My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon...we picked this place because it was advertised as newly renovated and kind of away from the busier parts of Sedona. It was so disappointing. It is so frustrating that we spent money for our honeymoon on a place that was completely not worth the price. The staff did not make us feel very welcome. We told them it was our honeymoon and she just rolled her eyes and handed us a voucher for a free drink. We went to them later that day to ask for suggestions on good places to eat and you would have thought they never have visited Sedona! She just seemed perplexed we were asking the question...we learned we were better off asking people outside the hotel for help. It was so disappointing and frustrating that our honeymoon was ruined by such a lame location and snooty staff.This hotel has been absolutely perfect. I came here for a relaxing weekend away from Phoenix and was not disappointed. The property was beautiful and easy to find. The check in was very quick, allowing me to get to my room and unpack before heading into town.The room is in fantastic shape with granite countertops, a living room with fireplace, small kitchenette, and a huge bedroom and bathroom. Additionally, there is a small outside patio off of the living room. The room pictures looked great on the website but can't describe how great it is in person.I had a small issue with my booking as the Hilton associate that had booked the room for me did so incorrectly. Randy at the front desk was above an beyond helpful in clearing up the issue and ensuring that everything was corrected in a timely manner. She is a real asset to this property. This stay has been extremely nice and I would definitely recommend that you stay at this hotel.The Hilton Sedona is located about a mile from Tlaq and the ""Y"" intersection in Sedona. For the most part it is a typical hilton resort hotel. The room was nice, there was a living area, a separate bedroom and a fireplace (a plus). It is an older property which has been renovated and one can tell. I am taking a couple of points off for a couple of reasons. First the pressure in the shower was week - keep in mind we had done a bit of hiking in the area, so it would have been nice to have a normal or high pressure shower head. The internet service was choppy at best- constantly in and out. 3 stars.We had the best customer service! Starting from the front desk to maintenance, maid to restaurant and bar. You guys awesome! Thank you for your service!","Overall the stay was okay. The wifi was atrocious (needed to reconnect every few minutes) and we asked for our resort fee to be comped. The lobby is well appointed, but the rooms are a bit dated. The fireplace is a nice addition but it had a bit of an awkward placement. I would have preferred it in the bedroom. The staff was happy to give maps and recommendations for hiking trails. I wasn't a fan of the breakfast system for diamond members. They place a credit on your bill that covers the continental breakfast - but not the buffet which is all in the same area. They seemed to nickel and dime with this and the resort fee. I would stay somewhere else for my next visit to Sedona.What we liked:  it was good to stay in Oak Creek and drive up to Sedona - not far and what a better view during the trip?  By the way,  if you need food for your room there is an IGA off of Verde Valley School Rd. The room was nice (upgraded to a suite with Mt view). We enjoyed the fireplace as well. What we didnt like:  many rooms under renovation. We always had to walk away from the lobby due to the construction. This was tolerable but irritating when you are paying a $20 resort fee. The staff are nice but never put forth any extra effort. ""How's that new restaurant down the street?""  We aren't sure - we dont have a menu yet. Need a drink at the pool?  Good luck finding someone. A waitress walked by and didnt even say hello!   The spa people dont seem to associate with the hotel. The hotel discount for spa services is only for certain treatments. Overall it just wasnt what you would expect from a Hilton. The people can make a difference and in this case, they made it worse.This hotel was a life saver for me and my family on our trip through Arizona. First, the front desk staff was excellent.Probably my favorite Hilton property, and I have been to many.  Huge, nice, clean, rooms. Great views, nice outdoor restaurant / lounge space.  Live music outside.  Had the beet salad and sweet potato fries.  Both really good and the salad was huge!My recent stay was to attend a conference at the Hilton.   Everything from our room accommodations to the breakfast, refreshments and desserts during the conference were top notch.  I did hear a few complaints that refreshments did not include soda pop!   I eat a mostly a vegetarian and unprocessed food diet, and I am usually the one finding it difficult to find healthy selections.  I was more than pleasantly surprised. All of the staff that I encountered were incredibly polite and friendly.  I think that this establishment must follow the 5 foot rule. Every staffer I encountered offered a good morning or how are you.  During my stay I required frequent use of ice packs.   Although we had a fridge in our room, there was not a freezer.  I was constantly bothering the front desk staff to ask for an ice pack. They were always accommodating and not once acted put out.   As I was dealing with some painful health issues, this was a life saver!  My husband played golf daily on site, while I attended meetings, and he was very pleased with the course.  If we come back to Sedona, we will surely stay here again!We stayed here for a weekend getaway, and the hotel did a decent job.  Given we are Gold members and stay at Hiltons around the world we have a good point of comparison when reviewing one location versus another.  They did go over and beyond to make sure we were comfortable.  Issues were we had to beg for bottled waters and basic Gold member perks that were easily provided staples in any other location in the world.  Hotel phones and Internet were spotty and cell phone reception almost non-existent.  Not a bad experience...but also not uniquely memorable.  We will be back unless we find a great rental on AirBnB or Flipkey or VRBO--which is almost comparatively the experience of staying here.  Service was almost no different than having no service at all.No room service after 10pm, if you arrive after that you have to walk to a bar on the property for takeout. In the time it takes to walk there you could drive to Wendys and the food would be 100x better. The view from the parking lot is awesone, from my room was ok. The small local hotels in the heart of Sedona offer better views and are closer to tours etcGreat hotel!! Beautiful and clean. The location was perfect -- close to all the action but not right in the middle of it! The restaurant in the hotel was delicious and the service there was great. The spa and their staff were also spectacular. My only complaint is the concierge service. They were incredibly unhelpful and even rude. They couldn't even do the simplest of tasks - such as suggest a restaurant or give directions to a store down the street.If they change the concierge staff, I would gladly go back!This is a nice hotel and I have stayed here many times over the years since they opened. I just have a few suggestions if you are thinking about staying here... The hotel restaurants and the room service are okay, but Sedona has some great restaurants -- go and check some of them out instead of staying in the hotel.  Though the rooms are fine, I suggest spending a little extra money and renting a suite. The suites are much nicer than the rooms and having a separate bedroom opens up all kinds of new possibilities. If you are planning to stay at this hotel for its pools, don't believe the photographs of the pools on this hotel's website. The photographer was very good and he made the pools look very spectacular. They are not. They are pretty much just hotel pools. If you want spectacular pools, go to Hawaii. There the hotels have great pools, this hotel does not. But, overall, this is nice place to stay and I never have any complaints.Great place for families or couples looking to relax. In the center of Sedona it has several pools designated for families/kids and not so what ever is your pleasure, quiet or play, its here. The staff were also super helpful, food there was great and also great food within walking distance. I was on a trip with me a my mother and had a great spa experience. If you are looking for somewhere to relax while you are not exploring the nearby red rocks, this is it. Also look into triple A discounts. We got a great upgrade because of it at a reasonable cost. Worth every penny!!Loved this place, wish I could have stayed a few more days. This was a rest stop on a trip with 12 other people. We had traveled from Chicago on our way to Santa Monica working with ministries along the way. This was a real treat! The room was clean and comfortable, the amenities wonderful, pools, spa, hot tubs. I spent a good part of my day doing laundry in the onsite laundry room which is why I would have loved another day or two here. I certainly intend to come back on my own some day soon.Hmmmmm, my family drove 7 hours and arrived at 2:45, we were told they would guarantee a call by 4:00pm latest. We didn't get a call until 4:30, and were told ""sorry we forgot"" ...what??? Isn't that really the only thing reception does ? I have two little kids with me :(Ok so we pull up to he front and look for a bell boy, ""Sorry he's on a break."" My husband asked if he could use the dolly . Ok so now we are bringing up our own bags! I know it's not the Four Seasons, but it's not exactly a best western either ! Not at $320 a night :/Room: weird layout (to many doors ); no bath tub but leaky shower door that spills everywhere, stained floor tiles.Customer service : If you don't mind never hearing a hello, or vacuuming while entering the lobby ( which they don't stop and you need to step around) then it's fine . Pool: dint date order a drink at the pool without going up the bar! As we were told by the bartender, they only take food orders. Ummm, the pool attendant asked if we wanted to have a server sent up. We replied yes. She can up and I asked for lemonade and the look I got was.....how was I supposed to know she wasn't a server :/When we did go back down and ask for nachos , it was quick but I know why! The store bought blue chips were covered in COLD liquid cheese . How ow that even possible ? Was it someone else's order that for sent back ? Who knows ?Let's end with this. I cancelled a previously scheduled message. If this was foreshadowing of things to come , I didn't want to blow another  couple hundred for mediocre ! I'm mean if a prickly pear margarita was bleh (which it was) , then how good could a full service be :/Super disappointed in the Hilton chain... The property, lobby decor, and rooms are very nice (just like I expected). We got in around 9pm and were taken care of immediately by probably the only nice employee in this entire place. We walked into a room that was pretty decent (in size with a living room that had a fireplace, separate from the bedroom) but smelt a little stale, once the AC was lowered it was fine. The first thing I notice was the dirty floor in the bathroom (don't let the weird streaks that look like dirt on the tile trick you, that's not what I'm referring to) there was hair from the previous guests all over. Wanting to relax I called downstairs to ask about pool hours (family pool closed at 10 and quiet pool closed at 11) When I went downstairs I asked for directions to arrive at a chained up pool that was closed due to weather. You would think that one of the two staff members would have informed me of this. The next morning we were on our way out and stopped at the front desk to ask that housekeeping pay extra attention to the floors. Instead of being concerned with our request the lady explained, with attitude, that house keeping wasn't there yet. We let her know it wasn't a big deal as we were heading out. We asked about breakfast and again with attitude were told sorry it's not open yet. By the end of the conversion we had to offer our room number to her because at no point did she care to find out what room needed the bathroom floors cleaned. In the afternoon we went to the pool for over three hours and not once did anyone walk by to offer us towels, food or drinks. I'm glad I have two legs and two arms to do it myself.  At night we ended up with a leak I our bedroom (monsoon season) the grounds keeper was there right away and said he would notify the front desk to move us rooms. We get a call asking if we would like to be moved. Umm, if you are trying to sleep and your roof is leaking, wouldn't you? I know they have no control over the leak but they do have control of how they treat their guests. This place needs help!We had a really nice stay at this hotel.  The rooms were spacious however they are rather dated .  If u visit this hotel there Stone massages are a must.We stayed one night, and I'm gonna say it was ""just okay"" , definitely nothing special. I'd look around before I would stay there again. One major turn of was the cockroaches I saw out in outside dinning area, totally grossed me out. The breakfast buffet is overpriced and the quality of the food is sub standard.  Just keeping it real....I was quite disappointed after staying here. I paid a little extra so that we could have a nice experience in Sedona and I was severely disappointed. After checking in late, I was getting my 3 year old ready for bed and when I went to get her into the bed, it was FULL of ants! ICK!!!! At midnight I then had to pack all of our stuff up and move rooms, well they moved us to a SMALLER room?!!! I didn't want to bother asking for a nicer room since it was already midnight and no one offered to help us move rooms. I wouldn't spend the extra money to stay here next time, I'd rather stay at the Hyatt or somehow that will have better customer experiences.The best fish tacos in Sedona . They have really good cocktails and food . Wednesday and Saturday there is good live music in the restaurantI'm pretty liberal with my five star ratings, but there's just no way I could do that in this case.  Firstly, let me say that our stay was ""fine"".  The people at the front desk were great; friendly, helpful etc.I thought the lobby was cool, zen like and I loved the organic art.  So, we walked into our room, (the pictures are totally accurate.) and it smelled nasty.  I said it smelled sort of mildew-y and my husband said it smelled like something died there. Because I really don't complain about things unless it's pretty bad, we decided to open the  window and air out the room. It was nice though.  We had a suite and the two rooms, one of which had a small balcony, were  comfortable.  It was clean, the bed was very comfy, and the views were grand!  No kidding! That's the word that comes to mind when I see the mountains in Sedona.  We decided to check out the rest of the resort.  We weren't disappointed.  There were two fabulous pools, one with a bar, the other was on the spa side where the fitness center/spa is located.  The restaurant seemed to have a good atmosphere with nice decor, but I thought the menu was boring  I don't eat meat and there wasn't much choice for vegetarians.  Anyway, when we returned to our room, the smell was still there and my husband decided to call and see what could be done.  They were genuinely concerned and told us they could move us to another room.  Well, we were already unpacked with the fridge semi full.  When we hesitated about that choice, they told us they would send housekeeping up.  Some guy came with spray and looked for the source of the smell.  Not much luck though.  I asked him if he could smell it...He said he couldn't but he was having sinus problems.  After he left, my husband actually moved the fridge where the smells seemed to be coming from. What he saw was water that spilled from the evaporation pan and he thinks there was a ""dead critter in that evaporation pan"".  He couldn't take the pan out because of the way the fridge was made. ANYWAY, the spray helped a little.  In the morning, the coffee maker didn't work.  It just kept turning off, wouldn't stay on.  That wasn't a big deal though.  I have a great husband, he went out and bought some strong coffee.We did the Yoga class at 11 and asked for an extended check out time. They were very gracious and said there was no problem.  They also let us check in a little early when we first got there. The Yoga class was fantastic!  My husband and I have been doing Yoga for a while, and Andrea was a wonderful instructor.  All in all the stay was fine.  The decor was ""okay"", but I would have thought it would be a little more upscale.  However, I think they indicated that they were going to redecorate all of the rooms.   Honestly, it really was fine.I stayed at the Hilton Sedona Resort &amp; Spa for five nights during my stay in Sedona.  I requested a suite with a nice view and was given one with a spectacular view!  (I posted pictures)  The suite was wonderful, I am handicapped and unfortunately the room was extremely far from the lobby elevator.  I requested another suite that was closer and they happily obliged.  On my second day I was moved to another suite, the view was beautiful, but not as gorgeous as the first.  It was quite cold on the nights of my stay and I loved being able to use the fireplace.  The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make my stay a great one.  The beds were extremely comfortable, I slept even more soundly than I do at home.  I was surprised at how quiet the suite was, it was just two doors down from the main elevator but I didn't hear anything at all.  They have a great gift shop that carries a little of everything.  I found a great gift for my mother at a nice price.  They have some beautiful jewelry, a nice selection of t-shirts and sweatshirts, a nice selection of gifts, great postcards, snacks and drinks.  My favorite was the tiny dream catcher jewelry, very intricate.  They have a great restaurant and offer the full menu for room service.  My suite had a refrigerator and a microwave, so leftovers didn't go to waste.  Overall, my trip was wonderful, I enjoyed my stay at the Hilton very much.  The only thing that I would change is that the Hilton isn't actually in Sedona.  I didn't have a rental car and the taxi trips to Sedona can get pretty expensive.  An average of $25 each trip.  Other than that, everything was pretty close to perfect.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to the Sedona area.I would stay here again. There is a lot of facilities, ranging from the heated pool, the golf course across the street, the bar, the restaurant, the spa and a much appreciated balcony on each room that provides an excellent view of the red rocks.I stayed for 2 nites and paid with my miles, it was rather pricey but worthwhile.The weather plays an important factor when visiting Sedona. I would prefer to have visited when it was warmer so the pools area is much more fun. Unfortunately, i was there during Spring and it was still chilly.  The pools are heated, there is a hot tub, but it was still cold in the evening. They even have plenty of fireplace / firepits to keep you warm.If you do visit, try to get a tee time across the road and make sure you visit Bell Rock trail.","Wow!  I guess I needed to stay here when all of the other folks giving this place 4/5 stars where!  Completely sub par experience for what I thought the standard of a Hilton should be.  Maybe it has something to do with the lousy hotel restaurant employing the ignorant waitress by the name of Kelli from New York (as her name tag shown) who decided to exhibit blatantly racist attitudes toward my husband and myself---when all I wanted was my order to be taken and to eat--whether she had a personal problem with folks of my complexion or not!  The food is just about edible anyway.  Hilton---what happened?!!Or, maybe it was the ridiculous, most inconvenient planning by management for accommodations to guests needing to make their way through the hotel while undergoing renovations?!  Walking through guest rooms and business offices just to get to the gym/pool/lousy restaurant, etc.  is not my idea of vacation or my vision of what it means to stay at a ""Hilton Resort and Spa!""  Could've just spent the money at a Garden Inn.  The set up is frankly for lack of a better word---ugly.  Some of your staff clearly exhibits that ""ugliness"" as well.Note to Kelli from NY: Keep that $&amp;@! at home Kelli!  It's 2014!  You can certainly wait your shift through until you can put on the white robe and pointed hat!  Since it is that serious apparently.Oh! And I musn't forget to mention the 4pm housekeeping visits to our room for cleaning!  Really Hilton?!  Last thing anyone wants to do is spend a day hiking and come home tired to a dirty room!Hopefully, this hotel will return to its glory days of 15-20 years ago once this renovation is completed.  Crossing my fingers that the upgrades will not only include the lobby but these outdated rooms as well.I dislike having to write so negatively---but, the level of disappointment with this ""Hilton experience"" warranted my speaking my mind.  Good luck if u choose this place as there are much nicer in the area!The hotel is nice...I'm giving 2 stars bc the restaurant on the other hand is HORRENDOUS! Keep in mind I'm 7 months pregnant. We got to the restaurant about 5 mins before our 8pm reservation and were seated immediately. We then sat for over 20 mins before our server came over to take our drink order since we waited so long for any service we went ahead and placed our whole order at that time. After another 25 mins of waiting for our drinks and appetizer my husband complained to the manager and mysteriously within mins we had our drink and appetizer. Again we placed at our food order at approx. 8:20pm at 9:05 the table next to us complained and got their food. About 10 mins later our food came. At this point I was too nauseous to eat and got it to go. While the manager took care of our bill there was no apology whatsoever from her or the server. The only person to help us or apologize was another server Shelly who had seen us sitting there and tried to do all she could to help. Shelly and the guy would kept our water glasses full were the only bright spot of this $80 dinner.Spent Christmas Holiday here with our geriatric dog on a package deal.  The hotel remodel is very nicely done.  Staff was great even with the crush of holiday guests.  Restaurant was very good by big resort standards.  And of course, the views were the icing on the cake.My complaint is about CONNECTIVITY.  Our AT&amp;T cell phone reception flipped back and forth between one bar and ""No Service"", all the while showing either LTE or 4G for data service.  In other words if you could connect, it might be fast.  Inside the resort we had free internet as part of the package, otherwise it is $12 per day.  Even by using the wired ethernet connection in our room, the fastest connection I achieved was .67 Mbps (note the decimal point).  Good dial-up is .56.  The FCC definition of Broadband service is 4Mbps or higher, so this was definitely not Broadband.  Having said that, the WiFi signal was very strong everywhere, just really slow.  The internet service was better than nothing, but we drove to Sedona twice a day just to check our phone messages and email.The staff here is excellent.  Very friendly, always smiling and ready to help.  The view is great and I do like my room.  I upgraded a King suite with a view so I see the Red Rocks from the little balcony.Having said that, the King Suite itself isn't all that amazing.  Pretty standard room.  The tub was pretty disappointing.  I expected better of the bathroom for the room type and price, but it was just a regular, boring tub.  Not even worth a bubble bath.Don't get room service.  We all expect room service to be incredibly over-priced, that's pretty typical, but the food should at least be cooked well.  $65 for one steak and Gorgonzola cheese hash browns?  Give me a break.  One morning I ordered breakfast and the bacon was under-cooked, the toast was semi-burned on one side, and each meal I ordered from room service arrived lukewarm to cold.I did have a massage and that was lovely.  Again, the staff has been wonderful.Oh!  The in-room coffee is horribly weak.  Double up on the little pod things if you want coffee that isn't brown water.  Coffee machine also doesn't get the water very hot.  Just sort of warm.We just arrived home from a holiday at the Hilton, and I have mixed feelings about this place. Gorgeous views, updated rooms, lovely pool area, and super spa employees! Here's the negatives with this Hilton; if you are going to call yourself a resort, be a resort. They have more programs for people's pets than they do kid stuff. The beds are horrible!!! Need a massage and a chiropractor to get over my stay! Thank goodness I did get a massage while staying there - great services, although the prices are pretty steep at the spa, and I have been to better appointed spas that were more affordable than this. The restaurant service at the hotel was slow and the food was mediocre - for the kind of money we paid for the breakfasts, I expected more. If they were a regular restaurant, they wouldn't last 6 months. The pool food is also mediocre. Thank goodness Miley's Cafe and Cucina Rustica were close by! But thank goodness most of the employees were very nice, and the concierge was helpful with our day trips. Would I stay here again? Good question. Since we were able to use reward points towards our stay, maybe. But if I am looking for more of a resort feel, this is not the place. Pretty much just an overpriced hotel with a good view and a golf course.I am an exclusive Hilton property guest and have high expectations on all fronts of the experience. This property is beautifully appointed from the lobby to the guest rooms. My wife and I stayed for a weekend getaway and upgraded to the king Suite with fireplace. The service was Hilton quality from check-in to breakfast server. The only negatives about the property: it is not in Sedona. The property is actually in the village of Oak Creek that does not have many restaurants or bars, this forces you to drive 10 minutes give or take into Sedona to wander about. The other negative was the bathroom did not have the same luxury as the property, it was not bad just not 4-5 stars. Finally a bit of personal gripe, the room we had was a suite with a kitchenette, however there were absolutely no utensils or kitchenware..... It was empty drawers and cabinets?I wish I'd read the reviews here instead of relying on Trip Advisor. The place isn't terrible, but it is a far cry from what I'd expect from Hilton. My boyfriend referred to it as the Applebee's of hotels. That says it pretty well, but if you're looking for details...The room was mediocre at best - thin carpet, cheap-looking furniture. I had been lured by the idea of a fireplace in the room, and while we did use it, it was nothing like the cozy experience I'd imagined. In fact, nothing about the room was cozy except the bed itself. Unfortunately, it had a rather pointy metal headboard, so the only time it was actually cozy was when you were lying down. I worried that leaning back would result in a head wound.The restaurant (The Grille) had really poor service during the 2 times we ate there. Both times the hostess/host was nowhere to be found, so a member of the waitstaff had to seat us. Granted, that's no biggie, but it was indicative of the general sense of disorganization. No one seemed to know what they were doing, parts of our meal were forgotten, and the waitstaff communicated to each other by yelling across the restaurant. We couldn't help but laugh because it seemed like we were caught in a scene from a bad sitcom. Still, I will admit that the roasted chicken I had was really quite good, so there's that. (See, I said something nice.)On the drive home today, I noticed we'd been charged the $18 resort fee for each day even though we did not use the wifi or any of the resort amenities. I'll be calling them about that because the way the woman at checkin represented it, that was an optional expense. Perhaps I misunderstood.In any case, that is the last time we'll stay there... and probably the last time we'll stay at a Hilton. The good news is we still had a great time exploring Sedona - a truly gorgeous place. Will be looking for recommendations on better accommodations for our next trip.First time to visit Sedona, AZ and stayed here at Hilton. The location was very nice and away from the busyness of uptown Sedona.  The staff were very accommodating especially Jackie at the restaurant. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely come back given a chance.The location of this hotel was just about perfect for us.  We had many activities planned in the Sedona area during our stay and we were never too far from any of them.  The hotel is very clean as you would expect from a Hilton.  It is a little small for a business that advertises itself as a resort, but we weren't planning on spending a lot of time at the hotel anyway.   The breakfast buffet was average,  but adequate.  The wait staff was hit or miss, some were excellent and others were slow.   Most everyone in the hotel staff was friendly and cheerful.As far as Hilton resorts go this place is top notch. Great view of the red rock, a nice lobby bar with great food and in one of the most beautiful places in the world.Great place right along Sedona. Can't beat the view of all the Red Rocks...although our room was facing the golf course. It is kind of smaller of rooms compared to other hiltons. The bar does have happy hour 3-5!One of the best stops on the book tour. Comfortable, relaxing, great rooms and great prices. Lamb Bison Burger was excellent and the views were beyond beautiful. Staff was also top notch and very helpful.As a Hilton Honors member, I am used to  getting good service concerning reservations from Hilton, this was not the case. I called Hilton Sedona to cancel a reservation we had made because I was unable to do it online. I told them I needed to cancel the reservation and was told, ""yes, the computer is really slow"". They were having trouble also, but canceled the reservation. A few days later I received an email ""welcoming me on my upcoming trip"". I called back and was told there was no cancellation, but it was done now. On my next credit card bill I was charged the one night fee. I disputed the fee to my credit card company and Hilton STILL CHARGED ME AGAIN!  I called and was put on hold for 10 minutes, transferred and disconnected.Our suite was spacious and comfortable, the Spa and Fitness Center are fabulous and the outdoor patio space is very inviting.  We highly recommend this hotel! We were very impressed with the excellent guest services provided by Katie, the Manager, Jessica, the Front Desk representative and Christie in Lost and Found/Housekeeping.  Katie and Jessica professionally handled a room rate problem caused on our end by speaking directly to the third party with whom we booked our reservation.  When I returned home, I discovered I was missing my favorite white shirt.  I called the Hilton and gave the information to Christie.  She called me back within the hour with good news, that she'd be happy to ship it complimentary via UPS Ground.  I had my shirt back within a week.This is my first visit to Sedona and I feel in love with the city. Is so quiet and serene. Hilton has just been renovated, the atmosphere is very nice, they have 3 pools and a wonderful spa. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We did 2 days back to back hiking and the views are amazing. I will recommend the Hilton and we will go back again. The suites are very spacious and very clean, they have balconies overlooking the golf club or the red rocks. If you want a look of the red rocks you have to ask for a room that has it.Been coming here once a year for years, it is slowly going downhill and is down to just ""ok"". If it wasn't the site of the conference I would look elsewhere. They've now instituted a ""resort fee"" to enjoy things like wi-fi and the gym. Seriously, 2013 and internet is an add-on? Fortunately for us it was included with the conference. Have also noticed they've removed some niceties from years past, the big firepit out back is gone, the nice booth seating area in the bar is gone along with the sculptures.I stayed here with my brother and his wife. We were in a suite and it was very nice, very posh. The view of the red rock is amazing. The lobby is very pretty. Rooms came with many amenities. The front desk staff was very friendly. Check in and check out was a smooth easy process. I can't say much more because we only stayed one night. But it was a good one.First, my husband is DIAMOND level with Hilton, staying weekly at their properties.We loved Sedona but had an incident at the Hilton where we were put in a less than Diamond level room, asked to be moved to a better room, the staff said they'd handle our bags - and items were stolen. They moved us from one end of the floor to another, and we're out a $400 item! The manager wasn't helpful, we filed a police report, and she told them they assumed no responsibility! The bags were out of our possession for 8 hours (we hiked and they moved us from one room to the other).. how are they not liable? We filed a claim with their insurance company and they state that the burden of proof wasn't met, and in fact claims are very hard to prove. Even my insurance company is shocked they refuse to reimburse us. If they treat one of their most loyal guests this way, I can only imagine how others are screwed.. Bad experience at this hotel.. Bad customer service. Beware!Great hotel with very nice rooms. To bad it is so far from all the action in Sedona.This hotel is ok.. I liked the steam and sauna and the open pit fires at night but.. nothing to write home about, it's just a little outdated and tired and needs an upgrade in it's rooms and common areas... I would spend the extra money and stay at a nicer place as this hotel is outside of the center of sedona.. Though that works in your favor as you are by a beautiful mountain! Overall if you need a night then thats cool but longer than a night and I would find a more beautiful place..","My fiance and I spent three nights at the Hilton in Sedona.  It was a serviceable hotel, if not particularly ideal.  Our room cost $250 a night, and it wasn't really nice, but I guess you pay out for a hotel in a resort town.Here are a few things I liked.  First, the hotel was very dog friendly.  We got a room on the first floor, where we were allowed to stay with our dog, and it was easy to take him out.  We weren't allowed to leave him home alone, but this is pretty standard.  When I asked the concierge about dog-sitting services, she recommended someone immediately.  The concierge was a definite asset to the hotel.  We got a lot of guidance from Marilyn, a friendly woman who gave us tips on what to do and where to eat around town.  She booked our Pink Jeep tour for us, and she printed out a list of dog-friendly Sedona restaurants she had on file.  The hotel common areas, including the lobby, pool, and fire pit, were pretty nice.  They felt resort-like, and they were never crowded.  The parking lot was also relatively easy to navigate.  Our room was large, much larger than expected.  It was an apartment-style space with a separate bedroom and living area with a little kitchenette.The room, though, was not great.  It felt shabby, dingy, old, and the bed was remarkably lumpy and uncomfortable.  For the amount of space we had in the room, we were unable to locate a single drawer.  If they were there, they were well hidden, and there weren't many.  We ended up leaving our clothes in our luggage.The other issue with the Hilton is that the location was just not ideal.  When we booked our trip, we didn't realize there was a place called Oak Creek, separated from central Sedona by a distance of several miles.  It took a long time to drive from our hotel to anything else we really wanted to do, and so we drove back and forth a lot during our trip.I'd like to come back to Sedona in the not-too-distant future, but I wouldn't stay in this Hilton again.  I'm sure there are worse hotels in town, but there must be many that are better, or at least better value.  I didn't hate this place, but next time, I'll try my luck elsewhere.Location wise, this place is about 15 min driving distance from the downtown area. Not a big deal-it's a beautiful drive. The rooms were ok. Nothing spectacular but clean and comfortable. I'm giving them 2 stars for the complete indifference of the front desk clerks (they don't even look up to say hello) and absolute lack of family activities. Yes, there are jeep tours etc downtown, but you are paying a hefty price to stay at this hotel and getting very little back in terms of service ON the property. There are pools of course but they are FREEZING in the fall/winter time. They'll tell you the pools are heated but it's not true.Also, they have local seniors sitting in the front lobby watching TV all day long, so the hotel guests can't come down and relax in the lobby (because guess what, once you are back at the hotel in the evening, THERE'S""S NOTHING TO DO...but I already said that). Same situation in the gym and group fitness classes.I was taken here as a surprise get away for Valentine's day. We had gotten a suite with a fireplace and fantastic view off our private balcony. Everything was beautiful, a little out dated but still nice. They were remodeling the lobby so we had to check in in a little side room which was a little confusing but worked nonetheless.  Only a couple things really stood out to me negatively. The first was the couch in our room smelled awful, like sweaty gym shorts, especially in one corner. I refused to sit on that side even though it was the best angle to view the tv. Second the tv in the bedroom was not working properly. All of the channels except for maybe 3 came through. We placed a call to the front desk and informed them of the issue. They sent someone up immediately, which was very nice considering it was almost midnight. The gentleman they sent up could not figure out the problem so we were issued a credit to use in whatever way we wanted. The gentleman suggested we get the breakfast in bed. After a brief deliberation we decided breakfast sounded like a great idea. So we picked our choices and hung the door hanger with the breakfast choices outside the door prior to the 2 am deadline (it was midnight by then). Thus, leading to the last issue, our breakfast never arrived. We had asked for it to arrive between 9:30 and 10 time frame. At 10:30, still no breakfast. We opened the door to find they had not even taken our order off the door. So we called down again and let them know what happened. They apologized repeatedly and had someone contact us for our order which would take a half an hour to be prepared. Our check out time was at 11 which caused a little bit of a conundrum considering we wouldn't get our breakfast until then. Called down one last time to see if it was possible to extend our check out time. They promptly adjusted it so we could check out at noon giving us ample time to enjoy our morning. Another issue we couldn't do anything about was when the air conditioner kicked on the sink in the bathroom made a loud tapping (like a Jumanji drum beat) the entire time it was on. Overall, there were some minor hiccups but the stay was decent. They did their best to make the stay worthwhile. I kind of wish we could have stayed another night so we could enjoy the amenities more (the Spa and golfing). The pool however, was also being renovated.Awesome place!  Check in was quick and easy.  We travel with a small dog. He is treated as well as us. Love this place! Great service as wellWe were pretty unimpressed with this hotel. Pros: front desk people were very friendly. The location is perfect if you're looking to enjoy Sedona without the crowded feeling you get down town. Great restaurants in walking distance (we ate at the schoolhouse which was very good). Rooms were ok but nothing spectacular. Cons: construction and renovations in the hotel are ongoing. There were huge bed frames, microwaves, and other construction materials that stayed in the hallways the entire time we were there. No valet people. No luggage carts. A crane sitting outside our window (def took away from the view). Concierge was often unavailable via phone or otherwise. The worst part of the stay was getting a drink at the bar upon arrival. When we asked if we can sit outside for happy hour, the staff looked at us confused and without a real answer. After talking to the third, and fairly impolite staff who didn't really have an answer for us, we just resigned ourselves to sitting at the bar. While we were trying to enjoy our beverage we witnessed the bartenders and staff blatantly arguing with one another. It was embarrassing and highly uncomfortable for us. We drank our drinks quickly just to get out of the bar and away from the wretched display of unprofessionalism. Overall, my husband and I agreed that if we had to pay for a hotel (we got this hotel from points) we would not stay here again. It's a Hilton but really you can't put lipstick on a pig....Had a nice visit! We did bring our kids and it worked out well! I would def love to come back and spend a weekend with just the hubs and I for a bit more romantic weekend! The room was great with a fireplace and balcony! Very relaxing and comfortable place!For the two nights my family and I and stayed here for, Hilton served us well. We stayed in a suite and the room was perfectly clean and supplied with lots of towels. If you stay on the first floor, instead of access to a balcony, you will have access to the parking lot. Which is a good thing because it saves you the trip of walking through the lobby to exit and it is a quick walk to grab something from your car. Service is ok. The staff  is friendly. Though we were given notice of noise complaints from other guest one night, security was friendly in regards to it. We ate at the Blue Water Cafe which is pretty good. It is located in the pool area- perfect place to relax in the sun with a cocktail. Don't be fooled, it looks like a bar but they also serve food. My sister and I tried their Sangria and it was alright. Really sweet.The chicken nachos is good too, but nothing spectacular. We also tired their sampler plate of chicken tenders, onion rings, fried mushrooms and french fries. On an empty stomach, the food is great and their portions are pretty big so share!Second time we have enjoyed this hotel in two years. Staff goes out of their way to ensure everything is perfect from the room to the food to the pools to the fire on the outside deck. Not one thing could be mentioned negatively, this place knows how to treat their guests.  We have told others about it after our first experience and will tell even more now after an equally perfect stay this year. Thank you all at Sedona Hilton for an excellent time!As a business traveler, I've stayed at hundreds of Hiltons and cashed in my points to stay at some of their more posh properties, and I expected the Hilton Resort &amp; Spa to be one of them. Sadly, the website gives the illusion of luxury, when in fact it felt more like a mountain-themed Residence Inn. Thankfully I didn't pay cash for my stay, but I did spend a boat-load of points on 3 nights here for a mother-daughter summer vacation. The room was large, but had zero character...just your basic tacky hotel furniture and a view of the parking lot. I walked in and my heart sank. I was expecting a little more class, maybe a spa-serenity theme, but no...even the Hampton Inn properties had a better feel than this room. The pool area was much smaller than the website photos imply. They must have done some tricky angles, because it was a small pool with a waterfall into another small pool and the seats fill up fast. They have food and drink service around the pool, but you'd be better off getting a sandwich at Subway...I paid $15 for the saddest Club Sandwich I've ever forced myself to eat. Plastic-like chicken and stale white bread (which was called ""artisan"" on the menu...ha!)By the 3rd day, we discovered that the lap pool was the best place to grab a shady seat and escape the screaming children playing in the other pools. Either way, lounging by a lap pool while the Resort members trained for their triathalons was not my idea of a relaxing getaway. The room had 2 refrigerators, stocked with nothing (no mini bar), and the one and only ice machine was a good 10 minute hike to the other end of the property. Not the amenities I'd expect from a Category 7 Hilton. The spa was pretty nice, I will admit. As a Hilton Honors member, you get free access to the spa which includes a super nice fitness center, lap pool, and exercise classes (we took yoga twice, it was a nice perk!)We paid a ridiculous amount for 2 massages, and both my mom and I had super-chatty therapists, which totally defeats the purpose of a massage...peace and quiet! I've had plenty of massage work done on me, and my experience at the Hilton was one of the least-professional (and most $$) by far. I was hoping the massage would redeem the ugly room, but nope...more disappointment. There seem to be better places with that 'desert charm' thing going on in Sedona. The Hilton is an okay place to sleep, but not ideal for a weekend of luxury and relaxation.I read some of the reviews so we booked a room.  We were disappointed.   For what you pay and what you get.  Not happy.   This is not up to Hilton standards.As a person of color I will not stay here again.  I felt very unwelcome.  The staff was so so.  I was on a family vacation with my family and was very excited and happy.  I took my children to the pool and people immediately left.  I then took them to the other pool and within 5 minutes they left again.  We then went back to the first pool and there they were back in the pool.  The engineer who fixed the broken tub in our room was unpleasant.  When we first came to check in we were told that they had a room with a view available but upon seeing my husband who is darker than me they then only had a first floor room available.  I thought it was my imagination but clearly it was not.  I will not spend another dime in the city of Sedona!Stayed for one night after a round of golf at Sedona Golf resort which is right next door, which is very convenient.  Its not in Sedona and there is only a couple of restaurants within walking distance.  The hotel room was clean, we stayed in a reg king room and had a fire place and frig and microwave.  Overall its a nice hotel but I wouldn't classify it as a resort.  They have a spa and a beautiful patio area for dinner or drinks, but it just doesn't feel like a resort.  Maybe its just me.I will stay here again, but only because they are so close to the golf course.The rooms are large with 7 interior doors!  It seemed to keep going and going.  There is a little fridge, coffee pot, sink and microwave as well as a little patio off the living room area.  The staff was very friendly and the resort grounds are gorgeous!  We had dinner in the main restaurant off the lobby.  The food was great.  I guess I would have to give it only 4 stars because the lounge closes at 11pm, even when the hotel is full.  Thanks to Brian for pointing out the Full Moon Cafe at the bottom of the hill, and walking us most of the way there. Check out the fire pits by the pools - very relaxing.Great spot.  We loved staying south of Sedona in Oak Creek, where the vibe is quiet and serene.  I would recommend staying here over the Hyatt in downtown, so you get more of a vacation feel (if that's your thing), and you only have a 5 mile (scenic) drive to town!  There are some restaurants and shops in Oak Creek as well, so you may not even choose to drive to Sedona.  Beautiful views.  We had a golf course view, but I would try for the red rock view next time.  We were on the 2nd floor, so there was some noise above us...try for the 3rd (top) floor if possible to avoid this, but you'll obviously have more stairs to climb if you don't use the elevator.  If you are a golfer, stay here since the golf course is right across the street.We would definitely stay here again if we visit the Sedona area.Beautiful Resort, was looking at a venue for daughter upcoming wedding. Wouldn't mind coming back to stay a night or two!The hotel is actually in the Village of Oak Creek just south of Sedona which is a 15-20 minute drive away.  The room was a nice size with mini fridge and microwave.  There is also a small balcony to put your wet swimsuits to dry.  The main pool was cold.  I assume it is only heated by the sun.  It was hot while we were there but it didn't get the pool warm enough.  Food at the restaurant is good but the breakfast buffet is lacking.  You can get omelets and pancakes with the buffet but you need to ask them to make it for you.  You can get free water bottles at the concierge but beware as to whoever is working the desk.  Sometime you get a great concierge; other times a big grump.I really like this place. It's a great deal for the price. The rooms are comfortable, they have everything that you would expect, and the service here is quite good. Also, it's kinda nice to be a little off the beaten path. The Village of Oak Creek is much quieter than Sedona, and it only takes about 15 minutes to drive to Sedona from here.The hotel has two pools...they have one set up for kids and another ""quiet"" pool. I plan to use that one. :) They keep the water heated to 80 degrees, so it's nice on a warm day.Their gym is better than most hotel gyms. Usually they aren't that great and tend to be stocked with so-so equipment. This one has everything you would want for a workout, and their locker rooms are very nice. Free use of the gym with your stay.Our family of 4 stayed in a double queen suite.  Rooms are clean and have a southwest decor. Our suite was spacious- 2 queen beds in a separate room, dining area with mini fridge, wet bar, microwave.  The living area has a fireplace, desk and pull out sofa.  We also had a balcony with a view of Red Rock. Lots of room for 2 adults and 2 teens.  The hotel should cover the balcony door- the sun is awfully bright at 6am, but if you get a room facing the back, you will love the view.Although there were families there, activities for kids on the hotel are limited to the pools.  There is a workout room, tennis courts and a spa on property and golf across the street. There is also a small gift shop on property.There are few dining options in this area. The restaurant on property ,The Grill, is a hit or miss. We dined there 2 different nights and food was inconsistent in quality.  Wait staff was always friendly. It can be pricey for a family- $16+ per person.  Blue Water Cafe serves drinks and light fare at the pool.There is a small retail/restaurant area within walking distance with Italian food (pricey) , a mongolian stir fry place and a few other businesses.  Not a lot of foot traffic there. A short drive past the roundabouts will take you to Wendys and subway and several other eateries.  This hotel is about 15 minutes outside of Sedona, in the Village of Oak Creek ( the nearest Starbucks is at the Hyatt in Sedona)  but it is a straight and easy drive to get to Sedona, Bell Rock, Cathedral Rock( fyi, Cathedral Rock is off ""Back O Beyond"" road- not clearly marked) .  It is about 90 mins from PHX and 2.5 hrs from Grand Canyon.Stayed here for 3 nights on a very nice Arizona vacation. The room was clean, nicely decorated, had a decent view (I was hoping for more though), and the staff was nice. I had breakfast every morning, and thought it was great. Had everything I wanted.I also dinner at their restaurant twice, and both times were fine. I thought the food was good, but the price was too high for what you get (it's not such a fancy place, yet the prices were high). Overall, I enjoyed my stay and don't have any major complains. I think I'll come back again in the future, if I visit Arizona again.My partner and I recently had a great experience at this resort, particularly the service we received from the concierge Thea.  We mentioned that we were vegan and she went out of her way to find places for us to have a great dining experience. We also mentioned we were looking at the real estate market in the city and she was very generous with her help on local information.  I can not praise her genuine and warm approach to the guests of the resort enough.  The resort itself is nice and very welcoming overall.  The front desk attendant that checked us in was also very helpful and pleasant upon arrival.","Here is the good, bad, and the ugly.Let me start by saying that I am a Hilton Diamond (which only means I have stayed at a ton of Hilton properties because of work travel - I'm not otherwise special due to this designation).  So yes, I have stayed at a ton of Hilton properties, in the US and in Europe.Hands down, this was the worst Hilton (not Hilton property, but actual Hilton) I have ever frequented.  Let me break it down:The good:They did allow our dog, who came with us on the stay.  They have rooms on the first floor designated for dogs, so if you have a dog, don't expect a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor.  The staff was very, very friendly.  And of course, the location - Sedona - is amazing.  Our view from our non-private deck area (if we moved toward the parking lot about 20 feet) was quite breathtaking.The decent:  The restaurant food was decent.  Breakfast was pretty good.  The staff there was fantastic (a recurring theme).  The pool area and other amenities were also quite nice.The bad:The overall quality of the rooms was just meh.  For a Hilton, I expect more.  Also, there were private homes within about 30 feet of our room, and trees which obscured the view directly from our patio area (which was non-private, also a concern.)  WiFi was free as a Hilton Diamond, but when we checked out, there were multiple charges for WiFi, and I was told ""this is intended for only one device.  Did you use more than one device?""  I'm guessing the look on my face was telling, because she immediately removed those charges.  But I've never heard this anywhere else (and yes, she was very polite).  And, the WiFi sucked.  Wouldn't stay connected (probably leading to the charges), so we'd have to repeatedly sign back in.  And when it DID stay connected, it rivaled my 28k dialup connection from the last century.  Slow, people.  Also, our television came on sporadically, though thankfully not during sleeping hours.  Never did figure this one out, so I unplugged it.  The mini-fridge didn't work well, and there was no freezer component.The ugly:Well, the WiFi.  I was working remotely for four of the days we stayed there, so the internet was just about enough to prevent my work from being at all fruitful.  There was also a goodly amount of 'hallway traffic' and other guest noise.  I don't know if this is representative of really loud guests, or poor insulation/construction.As I said, this is definitely the worst-overall Hilton experience I have had, and I have had lots.The Hampton Inn we stayed at in Phoenix was far better than this property.  Sure, I have stayed at Hamptons that were worse than this Hilton, but for a Hilton, you expect a certain thing.  That thing isn't here in Sedona.So, if not for the great staff, and they fact we could bring our dog, this would have been a rare (for me) 1-star review.  Definitely will not be returning to this Hilton.  Sedona on the other hand.....  absolutely!!!Hotel is nice, but FAR from Sedona happenings. Unfortunately not many good views of red rocks (can only really see the formations from the parking lot).The room service bison burger was all charcoaly and way overdone. The jacuzzi was lukewarm which is an extreme let down once you get all the way to the pool!   On the bright side, got an amazing massage at the really nice spa. Go for the 80 minute spa special hot rocks energy and deep tissue awesome.- Tamara Cross LawyerFull review:  <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwhentozen.com%2F2010%2F09%2Fa-room-with-a-view-Hilton-Sedona-Resort-and-Spa&amp;s=010d6cf30d0820ce723966331619a73ccde9e2318e2006035e4553ecff4ccd3c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">whentozen.com/2010/09/a-...</a>ActivitiesThis month, I have the extreme pleasure of visiting Sedona which is a two hour ride from Scottsdale, AZ. It was nice to escape the heat into the mountains with a high intensity cardio plan in mind.  I grabbed my CamelBak and totted my mountain bike up to the Solder's Pass Trail of Route 89A. If you are driving up to Sedona 89A from Cottonwood, AZ is an excellent and beautiful drive into Sedona. The trail is intense and is a long intense trail that winds down into The Village of Oak Creek through Schnebly Hill and Route 179.Some local incredible features include Devil's Kitchen ( a huge sink hole from 1891) and Seven Pools where rain water pools. I've been visited Sedona every couple months for the last 5 years and every time I find a new location or unique rock structure unlike anything I've ever seen. From a fitness perspective, this is one of the many locations you can just jump into the wilderness and trail run or hike within an hour.As you can imagine all this exciting outdoors adventures does turn into a lot of sweating, (one of my least favorite experiences) and I want to find some quiet and comfortable place to write on my laptop.LocationTo make a full day of it I headed over to the Hilton Sedona Resort &amp; Spa. Although, I did not stay at the resort I did indulge in all the amenities the Spa had to offer. The spa offers a private lap pool with poolside service, tennis courts, a fully stocked and overly accommodating ladies locker room, a fitness room that could keep me busy for hours, massages and treatments, and a luxury golf course across the street. In addition there is a cafe and a hairdresser on site. The cost for Hilton Spa access is $20.00 for the day for non-guests and gives you access to all the amenities except the spa treatments and golf.User ExperienceUpon walking in you are in a tranquil setting and the hostess behind the desk immediately welcomes you and discussed all the elements the spa has to offer. The offer you a private locker key so you can dump off you gym bag and travel light.After exploring the spa my travels took me to the Fitness Center because well... I'm like a kid in a candy store around weigh machines. Have to try them all! The room was clean and the equipment was very new and fully functioning.  At the tennis courts I indulged in the ball machine which I scheduled for an hour with when I signed in to the spa. Special perks are the phones at the Hilton, from any blue phone you can order drinks/food and they bring it to you! TOTALLY fabulous experience! I am a big fan of feeling catered too and cared for.  (Many businesses seem to miss this element and fail on user experience).After showering and heading to pool to set up in a cozy chair, views of the incredible red rock formations in sight, with my laptop I was very comfortable and the surroundings were quiet. So, awesomely quiet you could hear the white puffy clouds forming above you. Snapping back from my inspirational moment to write another chapter. My salad and margarita arrived as a good sign of another break to be had. The salad was delicious and fresh. The service was prompt and they came to pick up my plate and freshen up my drink moments after I finished. A particular aspect of service I crave is the clean up. If you eat outside the leftover plate attracts flies and bees and it is terrific if the area is cleaned promptly.After and hour and handful of laps I retired to the ladies locker room to clean up and spend sometime in the hot tub before my ride home. There are many amenities including all toiletries are included. I particularly love the conditioner smells like something I can't recognize but calming. There are many facilities and amenities I have not mentioned but worthy of experimenting yourself. I would highly recommend if you need a private escape off the map for the day this is an excellent location.Something about Sedona is a clarifying on a deeper level. The stress and deadlines just melt away into accomplishable bullet points and time management for the next week.Extra Note: I grabbed dinner at A Fork In The Road down the hill. Read my review HERE.Ratings:(Very simply we rate on a 1-5, 5 being the best rating.)Spa: 5Sports: 3Pool: 4Fitness Center: 4Meals: 4Service: 5Room: N/AYelp Reviews Online:This place is gorgeous! Excellent view of the red rocks surrounding the area. The room we had was a suite complete with a balcony, fireplace, spacious bathroom, and a whirlpool tub in the bedroom.Very nice hotel. We were upgraded to a King Suite. The room was a it dated, but clean and comfortable. The hotel is a 15 min. drive away from downtown Sedona, and restaurant choice is limited nearby the hotel. The breakfast was included (as I am HHonors Gold member), otherwise it would be too expensive for what you get.Horrible experience - overpriced, dismissive staff, but beautiful pool and gym.  Still will never stay at a Hilton property.* Overpriced $100 welcome ""fruit basket"" - plate with a banana and apple with a few grapes. Not a basket, just a $10 fruit plate from room service.* Bland breakfast buffet and poor service -  dry and plain food.  Also, when I asked for syrup, our waitress said ""you must have missed it on the table over there"".  * Poor housekeeping -  If I hadn't seen the bed made, I wouldn't even have thought they entered the room. * Unhelpful concierge - We frequently went to the concierge for activity, restaurant and transportation recommendations.  They just gave us pamphlets and made us call for reservations and bookings.* Faulty Credit CardAuthorization system - this posted as a pending charge on my card, which flagged Amex to put a hold on my card for 5-7 business days.  When I asked the front desk to release the charge, they could not and would not do anything to resolve and address the inconvenience.  They blamed their system and did not see a flaw in their service or system.Basic facility, far from main market Sedona, average property, limited menu single restraunt.They wanted $6.00/day for WiFi access in your room.  Who does that anymore?  They could simply charge every guess .20 cents more and never have to ask for additional money for WiFi.  I was forced to go to the local coffee shop out of principle just so I didn't have to pay the $6.  BTW the FireCreek coffee shop had great WiFi speed, good customer service and in addition to coffee they have food/bakery items.  Great spot.  As for the resort, there was nothing there that you couldn't get at any other of the same quality hotels in the area but with WiFi.Tremendous disappointment. Rooms are poorly planned, in no way taking advantage of the wondrous views of Sedona. And the furniture in the suites is so uncomfortable one looks forward to leaving one's room. Too bad, since the reason for paying extra for a suite is to feel like one is home and can take a nice morning lounging around. Not here!Relaxing, Out of the way and Not in the Middle of TownI don't like staying in the middle of town... so this place was perfect for me and my husband.  However, if you like to be ""in the mix""... don't stay here as it is about a 15-20 minute drive to the main part of downtown Sedona.Hotel Pros:Out of town (for me)Full service resort including spa and golfGreat staff, very accomodating and friendlyReally liked our room which was at the end of the unit and had a jacuzzi tub... and the jets were on your bottom not your sides.... Oh Yea!Comfy bedSeparate living room with soft couch and flat screen TVFridge and microwaveBathroom could be accessed from living room while bedroom was separateView from our 2nd floor room showed Bell Rock and other beautiful red rock formationsHotel Cons:A bit priceyFireplace didn't workCeiling and walls were a bit thinLinens were a tad stiff... not super soft and comfy like at some other hotelsWater pressure was a little low but not as bad as other hotels I've stayed atRoom service had a service fee, plus tax, plus $5 additionalSpa:Enjoyed the Sedona Vortex which was a delight... I almost fell asleep on the table after the deep tissue partMy therapist (Janet) was very nice and had great hands!Spa locker room was one big area with lockers, bathroom, sink, a steam room, dry sauna and jacuzzi but the amenities, ambiance were nothing to get excited about...rather plain (note: I judge everything by either Farimont Scottsdale spa or Green Valley Resort spa...both of which are my favorites)Spa personnel were very nice and spoke in quiet, soothing tones - no loud, boisterous folksOverall.... I'd go back to the hotel and spa if I went back to the areaStayed here with my wife and chihuahua over the fourth of July weekend. Amazing time. I reviewed the dining separate, this is just on the resort itself. One of the nicer things we liked about this, is that it wasn't right in the middle all the hustle and bussel of Sedona. To get to Sedona proper you'd drive about 20 mins. We had a King Suite, which was pet friendly. We arrived about two hours before the scheduled check in, and just wanted to see if we could put our bags in our room. To our surprise, our room was ready and they invited us to check in early...free of charge. Big points in my book. We got to the room, and it was great. Large dinning room table, nice kitchenette, spacious living room...good stuff. I'm a details guy, so the Hilton always impresses me. No dust, none. Clean furniture, fresh smell, and extra pillows. Nice balcony we could just open up and take our pup for a walk. Fireplace worked, but being July we didn't really use it. Two staff members really helped out! Beverly and Javier were especially helpful. Both gave us great advise on some must see trails, and some great off the site restaurants. My wife said the spa was 5 stars. She loved being able to use  the steam room and the whirlpool before her massage. The staff was good about letting her relax, and not always asking her if she needs anything.Good place to stay and we were not disappointed in the slightest. I'd suggest staying here if you are looking to lounge and relax. Also, VERY pet friendly which to some of us is important.This is not your run of the  mill Hilton.  It's the nicest and newest Hilton I've been to with ALL the amenities and then some.  Here's the extras you won't get at other Sedona resorts: FULL gym, even locals have memberships here, zumba, yogalates, tai chi. Space, space, space!  The 1 bedroom suite for $169 a night!  Living room, microwave, frig, 2 queen beds and balcony.   Almost as big as my house!  Breathtaking location near a residential neighborhood, I love the QUIET.Great resort, an excellent value in Sedona. Happy to be away from the tourists and close to hiking. An amazing pool and golf course too!Just came back from spending 3 nights in a 1 bedroom suite which has a wet bar with no glasses anywhere, a microwave sitting on a countertop and 3 or 4 drawers and a few cupboards with shelves, all of which are all empty.  Not a single bowl, plate, made of china or paper nor is there any cutlery.  So the fact that they supply a microwave is of no use to anyone, except for making popcorn I guess which you'd have to buy yourself anyway! Yes the bed is very comfortable and the decor is very nice, but it takes more than that to make a place comfortable.  Furthermore, there were only 2 garbage cans in the entire unit. One under the bar sink which was so narrow that it didn't hold much when you would put empty cans in it.  The second one was in the powder room which is fine, but we all know that one is always needed in the actual bathroom next to the toilet, but not there.  Lastly, the place is huge and spread out width wise, so in other words when you first check in and they don't tell you that they have other elevators closer to your room, be prepared to walk and walk and walk.  I don't know how I made it to the room which happened to be at one of the extremities as I have serious walking limitations, but I eventually made it in tears from the pain.  A lot of negatives compared to the positive.Gorgeous setting for a romantic get away or if you are looking for a meeting space.  Great conference rooms &amp; banquet rooms.  The staff is extremely accomdating and the food was excellent.  We had an overnight meeting for 25 and everything we did was at the Hilton.  They bent over backwards for us.  The room is fantastic, with your own gas fireplace, small kitchenette &amp; very nice bed.  The pillows are fantastic with a range in firmness...you could easily leave yours at home.   Highly reccomend if you are looking for a place to run away to in the heart of Red Rock Country.Outstanding ground floor room with car outside patio area about 30 feet away.  Estimate 700 square feet suite with a LOT of extras including 2 flat screen TVs, iron and board, fridge, microwave, gas fire place, private patio and big king bed.  Also lots of big resort extras like pool, hot tub, exercise room,Disappointments is it is NOT in Sedona and we has poor views of the red rocks.   It is about 8 miles south of Sedona and out of the area of great views.   WIFI is $11.95 a night and slow,  even with ether net cable connection.  Linking thru the cell phone was faster.They also use the message waiting light as a means of advertising what is going on in the hotel.   If you have a cell phone and do not like flashing lights, I suggest you either put the phones in a drawer or unplug them.Nice, clean &amp; comfortable.  A little pricey, pretty good views.  If you get a chance in the summer get a room with a pool view, you will see plenty of red dirt during your stay.  Wasn't a fan of the on-site restaurants but there are a few nicer options within walking distance.  It is about 10 minutes outside of the downtown area, which could be good or bad depending on your point of view.The resort itself is nice, above average.  There are certainly better.  The restaurant downstairs has a good sized bar and full seating.  The prime rib, fish special, and a variety of other things our group ordered were all very good.  The server, I think her name was Sharon maybe, was awesome.  Go there just for her.I've stayed at this hotel a few times and have always enjoyed my visits. However, the amount you pay for WIFI is ridiculous. I don't understand why it isn't just built into the cost of the rooms. Motels down the road include it for ""free."" Just annoying to have to pay for it separately when you are staying at a ""resort."" You expect this amenity to be included. It's also a bit of a drive from the town of Sedona. I've only had breakfast at their restaurant and it was pretty good. It's really close to Cucina Rustica (great place for Italian) and they even offered to drive us down in a golf cart and pick us up after dinner if we wanted to have drinks. Concierge made some excellent recommendations for dinner and had menus of the restaurants readily available for us to look at before we made a decision. All the rooms have small balconies and fireplaces. It's great to grab a drink at the bar inside and take it out to the fire pit by the pool and enjoy the evening.Stayed one night, and that was one night too long.We stayed in a suite. Here is why I won't stay here again:-With exception of a friendly man who helped my husband find the Tomcars the staff at front desk were not very welcoming. -The hallway we stayed in was dated. Room service crap sat in hallway too long.-Our Non-smoking room was full of cigarrette smoke. We notified front desk. They brought in an ionizer while we were at dinner. We returned from dinner, my husband rolled the ionizer into hallway &amp; called front desk. The machine didn't do much. Maybe someone was smoking in another room and it was coming through the vents? No follow up from front desk to see if our issue was resolved. I don't like wasting a weekend getaway following up on issues, I expect a Hilton to be equipped to check in with me to identify if the issue is resolved.-Related to above- barely slept, woke up with watery eye's and coughing from cigarrette smoke.-Internet- $12 a day. BS- we payed top dollar for a suite. I would understand if I had gotten a deeply discounted standard room, but that wasn't the case. So, for a one night stay (4 pm to 11 am) we payed $12.  Totally felt nickeled and dimed on this one. -kids- I guess its not the hotels fault.. I don't mind kids but I felt like they were taking over our already disastrous hallway.-view- nothing great. 2 chairs on pebbles partial view...-follow-up- After my return from this hotel the Hilton asked for my feedback via email. I took 20 minutes to provide some constructive criticism. I also included points of the stay that we enjoyed- the restaurant and the spa. No response. So, I guess they don't care. I really dislike getting no feedback from a company when I take my personal time to provide them with valuable feedback.PLEASE NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR HOTEL PORTION ONLY. RESTAURANT AND SPA ARE GREAT AND DON'T FALL UNDER THIS REVIEW","['nice', 'property', 'great', 'location', 'comfortable', 'courteous', 'staff', 'reading', 'yelp', 'reviews', 'worried', 'place',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/orchards-inn-sedona,Orchards Inn,4.0,$$,113,"This is my second year back to Orchards Inn.My first experience last year deserved the 5 star review effortlessly. From booking to check in it was perfect. The rooms here have the most breathtaking views.However this year, I learned that not all their rooms are the same. This year my experience at Orchards Inn started at a 3, star review then rapidly declined to a -1. After voicing my concerns to the front desk, Thomas advised that the manager Kevin will help. They quickly regained my five star rating for Orchard Inn.This would of been a bad review it is amazing what great staff and a beautiful hotel can accomplish. The experience this year took a little bit of work, none the less the 5 star rating remains. Thank you Kevin and Thomas!*update*Although the room situation was squared away I do have to say the quality of their beds are poor. On the first night I thought Bc we were sent to the ""400 building"" (the older not so nice hotel rooms) the bed was springy and  flimsy because we were in an old room. However last night with the change of rooms it's like they brought that old bed in here for us to sleep on. The service the view is five stars but their mattresses as seen by other yelpers, I'm afraid to even lift the sheet to actually see the mattress and my whole body aches from sleeping here for two nights.My wife and I stayed here this past weekend on 2/4~2/6 as part of my surprise getaway for her birthday.  Our normal place of stay, El Portal Sedona, was completely booked for this weekend, so we chose Orchards Inn based on their website and reviews.  The check-in process was very smooth and we were unpacked in our room within 10 minutes of arrival. This is where the positive experience began to go downhill.  Our first impression was that our room looked nothing like what it did on the website; it was very obvious that the price we paid were for the view and location in Uptown over the room itself.  The views were absolutely stunning, however the room looked like something out of Motel 6.  As we arrived on the night of the 4th, we went to bed early with plans to enjoy Sedona early the next morning.  When we came back from sightseeing and lunch the following day (5th), we discovered that the room was chilly (65 degrees when the unit was set to 75 degrees) and the unit was blowing cold air.  We called the front desk to report, which they sent a maintenance engineer within 10 minutes of the call.  The response was prompt, however the troubleshooting took over 2 hours during which we had to stay in our room until completion.  The issue seemed to be fixed and we left the room to head out to do some sightseeing before dinner.  When we came back to change for dinner, we discovered the room was now down to 60 degrees and the unit had been blowing cold air again.  We called front desk to report, to which the maintenance engineer arrived approximately 30 minutes after the call.  We then again stayed at the room while the maintenance staff were troubleshooting the issue.  We waited nearly three hours, during which the maintenance engineer left the premises without notifying us or of an ETA to fix.  We went to the front desk, upon which the engineer was called up and we were informed the problem with the heater was unable to be fixed that night.  We had already burned over 3 hours of time (on top of the 2 hours during the earlier visit) where we did not get any information on the issue, time of fix and whether it could be fixed.  Due to this, I not only had to cancel the birthday dinner reservation with my wife due to this issue not being resolved until close to 9pm (and the restaurant and most Sedona restaurants close at 9pm), however we also essentially had to sacrifice half of our day (which was our only full day in Sedona).  We were provided space heaters, however they were not adequate to keep the room heated for a comfortable night's sleep.  Our trip and my wife's birthday weekend was essentially ruined due to this.  The only positive I'll give is that the front desk was doing the best they can to help resolve the issue, going as far as comping our 2nd night which is the only reason why I am not giving this review 1 star.  However, as they say, you can't put a price of experience (or an experience ruined like this).  The views and location were amazing, but I would have rather paid the same amount of money at El Portal Sedona or L'Auberge where I know the customer service and the rooms are exactly what you pay for.What a disappointment. For the tune of $200+ a night, we expected this hotel to be much better than a flimsy motel. We were sorely mistaken.First off, the hotel's website is misleading and inaccurate. We booked this hotel specifically for the in-room fireplaces, as advertised on their website: ""Retreat to your comfortable room after a busy day exploring Sedona and unwind in quiet comfort with a gas fireplace and nice amenities."" However, upon arrival, we learned that there was NO fireplace at all in our room, and when we brought it up to the front desk clerk, he simply said there was nothing he could do. I also had requested a top floor room at the time of booking, but we were given a room on the bottom floor. Unacceptable.The room left a lot to be desired, and is in dire need of updating. While the view was spectacular, the actual room was dingy and dank. The fan in the bathroom area was deafeningly loud. The shower had the worst water pressure of any shower I have ever used. The walls were paper thin, and since our room was directly next to the lobby, we could hear everything going on. The hotel advertised having a ""free breakfast"", but each morning we wandered over to the breakfast area and found that they were completely out of most food, coffee, and water - and all of the trashes were overflowing. What a supreme disappointment. The hotel also advertised having a laundry facility on-site, but the laundry facility actually wasn't on site at all. Rather, you had to walk through several other hotel parking lots in order to get to it. Such a bait and switch. We love the town of Sedona, but we certainly won't stay here again. We would have been much better off at a Motel 6.Great location in town, and the views from our top floor room could not be beat--absolutely stunning! The fall  weather was a bit chilly at night, so the fireplace was a nice bonus. Our room was spacious (it was a corner suite) and our king-sized bed was comfy. Kevin at the front desk was very friendly. We were pleased with our stay here.After reading some of the other reviews, I was hesitant to spend the money for this hotel, but I'm SO glad I did! We stayed in room 428 which was a King suite room with a king-size bed, fireplace, and love seat. It also had the most amazing views!! Whether it was a sunrise or sunset, the red rocks were beautiful! I can't say enough about the customer service at this hotel, from the reservationist, to the front desk help, they were all very helpful and friendly. This hotel is centrally located in the heart of Sedona yet was back enough from the street to not be loud or noisy. The free morning breakfast was healthy and sufficient to start a day of hiking or walking around the town. If we were to ever return to Sedona we would for sure stay here again!!We stayed at the Orchards Inn for 4 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Our room was cleaned everyday and the front desk was quick to help when we realized that we forgot to pack toothpaste! The free breakfast was a good option for mornings when we were in a hurry but I can see why some other reviewers complained. Coffee, juice, cereal, granola, yogurt, bagels and toast were offered. No hot breakfast options but it was plenty for us!The views are amazing! We stayed in room 302 and had a great view of Snoopy Rock. If we weren't busy everyday, I could sit on our balcony and relax the day away! The king bed was comfortable and the room was well appointed with a flat screen tv, fridge and gas fireplace. Orchards Inn is is the heart of Uptown Sedona. Lots of shopping and restaurants within a quick walk of the Inn. It's also a quick drive to West Sedona. My only complaint was that you could occasionally hear your neighbors. The walls are a bit thin and in the mornings we could hear showers and door slamming. Not a big deal since we spent most days exploring and hiking the Red Rocks.3.5 Stars.Orchards Inn is a good choice for those who want to stay in the heart of Sedona within walking distance of everything.  There are three levels - the main level is considered the second floor. The rooms are old but well appointed with clean linens, a mini fridge, and standard TV.  The bathroom left much to be desired and is in dire need of a remodel, particularly the sinks which had severe drainage issues.  Look for discounted rates on travel websites like Trivago. Don't pay full price. What I really love about this hotel is the location and view.  Every room has a panoramic view of the red rocks, and the balcony was a nice place to take it all in.  There's a small pool on the first floor with pool towels.  The hotel is located steps away from the main road full of shops, restaurants, jeep tours, etc.  The staff was friendly and the continental breakfast wasn't bad (cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, banana/whole kiwi, toast/bagel, mini muffins/danishes, hard boiled egg, juices, milk, coffee and tea). I was fine with this until I saw another Yelper's photo had scrambled eggs and diced fruit. I didn't see any hot breakfast items during our two-night stay!I hope they fix up their bathrooms and repair the sinks because I'd love to come back for another visit.Great experience! Free coffee, tea and water bottles in the lobby. The free breakfast (served across the parking lot in their Mexican restaurant) was surprisingly varied (bagels, pastures, yoghurt, oatmeal, fresh fruit...) and the room just had an amazing view! Will definitely stay again!Room was nice, location is great, view nice.   I still can't believe they leave all the TVs on all day though (so you can see the 'visit sedona' tourism channel.  That's pretty tacky.We were excited to check in to the Orchards Inn to stay for 4 nights. We pulled up to a small parking lot, and the tiniest lobby ever. The uplifting part of the lobby was easy check in and the view right outside. When we got to our room, the smell was not pleasant, however the view from our second floor balcony was amazing. We had a table with 2 chairs to relax and enjoy. We were lucky to have the end of the building, because the balconies had little privacy from your neighbors. The musty smell of the room dissipated a bit after the A/C ran for a while. Later that night when taking a shower, the water couldn't keep a constant temperature. I almost burned my face off. The drain didn't work well, and there was a pool of standing water during my whole shower. I decided to move past this, until I discovered a streak of BLOOD on my sheets and pillow. We told the front desk about the drain and sheets and they immediately took care of it. We tried to move past this once again, UNTIL the next morning when I woke up and found what looked like a BED BUG crawling on me under my shirt. I did more investigating on the mattress and found casings of dead bugs in the mattress crevices. I immediately called the front desk who sent up the manager and tried to downplay all of my concerns and negative experiences thus far. He offered to move us to another room, but I declined and said we wanted to leave. The only positive thing about this, is that they refunded me the full amount of the stay and offered to find me another hotel. They were pretty professional, but I will never recommend this place and now I have to go back home and sanitize all of my belongings so I don't infect my house.I posted the pictures. If you want proof, you can find it in the album.We had a good stay here. We booked the deluxe king room. We booked directly through the the hotel which was great. Denise was so helpful and called us to get the king room for us bc originally they only had queen available. The prices seem  higher on the hotel website than like <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> but call and talk to someone because they were lower when I called. The room is deluxe bc of being on the top floor which has awesome views and the fireplace. The fireplace which we enjoyed more than anything since during our stay it was 45 degrees and raining! The room isn't really deluxe it's the fireplace and third floor location that qualifies as that. There is a fridge but no microwave. The shower is small and the shower head is low so if you're tall forget it. Also the water went from hot to cold the whole time. The double sinks are nice though. This place is right in the heart of tourist part of Sedona and we never drove just walked to the Cowboy Club for dinner and the Mexican place in front so that was nice. The staff was super accommodating. Unfortunately the weather prevented us form trying the pool and hot tub but it looked nice. I would stay here again.The Orchard's inn is the perfect place to say in Sedona. When you visit Sedona all the directions are from the ""Y"" where 87A and 178 intersect. The Orchard's inn is located at the ""Y"". The pink jeep, the trolly, shopping and everything else is right at your doorstep. Every room in the Orchard's inn has a breathtaking view of the redrocks. Snoopy rock is in your backyard. The room is clean and spacious and includes continental breakfast so you can hit the ground running. Look no further - this is the best place to stay in Sedona.Beautiful views and friendly staff. However, we had a bad experience. Hopefully a fluke. My husband went into the bathroom and the glass light fixture cover unexpectedly fell from the ceiling and shattered all over the floor. Luckily it missed his head, but glass cut his foot deeply. The front desk person and engineering/cleaning staff was very helpful in cleaning up all the blood and glass on the bathroom floor and expressed their sincere apologies, but no offers from the hotel to make amends for the incident or the injury. Not even an extension on checkout, though we had to wait to use the shower due to glass in the shower stall that had been missed by the clean-up crew the night before. I hope they will check and secure all the overhead light fixtures in all their units. If we decide to stay here again, that will definitely be the first thing I check out.Spectacular service! A+ newly renovated rooms. Majestic views. Belly-filling and vegan friendly continental breakfast. Right in the heart of downtown with killer access to all Sedona has to offer. Be sure to visit the crystal wizard at the sacred stone as wellCute clean rooms..patio with the best view ever!! Pool and jacuzzi and nice staff..what more do you need??Why do you come to Sedona? For the vistas! We'll this hotel has amazing vistas and private balconies to enjoy them. The rooms are clean and spacious. Mine had a beautiful fireplace and living room.  A continental breakfast was included. Waking up to the sun cresting the tops of the Red Rocks is amazing. There is an outdoor pool but it was a little to chilly in February to enjoy it. Parking is close to the rooms which makes loading and unloading a pleasure. If you are looking for a comfortable bed, ambiance and waking up to the most beautiful view in the world - this is the place for you. I will be backWhere to start- worth about a little above a motel 6. Just for the views.Views are nice but if you are on the first floor you see your curtains because everyone walking by looks into your room!Breakfast is packaged- well coffee is hot and there is some yogurt and hard boiled eggs.Bathrooms are dingy and the ceilings are so low I hit my hands every time I was changing. Ugh. Water surges hot and cold. In a busy part of town- like Disneyland busy...so if you are into t-shirt shops...just sayingGo somewhere else- they really are not even close to the quality of motel for the money they charge.Stay here instead of L'Auberge! We were looking at L'Auberge but were put off by their prices. We looked up the hill and saw this place. Turns out Orchards Inn has better views at a fraction of the price. Rooms were basic but clean and ours even had a nice working fireplace in it as well. For the price I think it's unfair people complain about the breakfast. Sure it's basic but it's included.My family and I stayed here July 27 - 29.  I can't say enough good things about how the staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs for handicapped accessible rooms next to each other.  The rooms were a bit shop-worn but very very clean and quiet with comfy beds.There were a couple of downsides, though.  One was the lack of seating in the room - there was one desk chair.  Also, there was a nice balcony overlooking the beautiful red rocks but the hard wrought iron chairs made sitting impossible for more than a few minutes.  A couple of cushions would have improved that immensely.  Another bad thing was parking - there never seemed to be enough spaces.  It would have been much worse if the restaurant (closed for remodeling) had been open. In retrospect, I realized that I should have booked a suite which has a couch.  Next time, for sure.My mom and I visited in July for my birthday trip. The room was clean, fairly, quiet, and had an AMAZING view. The location was perfect and we could walk to dining, shops, and the massages we booked. The only complaint I could have had was the out-dated decor for a $200 room. TIP: try to get on the 2nd floor for a better view. Kevin at the front desk was awesome and answered all our questions kindly and accurately! Plus, he made us laugh at check in, which is always how we LOVE to start off a fun trip!","Amazing views, walking distance to shops, restaurants and activities! Great place and would def stay again and recommend. Very quaint.I give 4 stars - husband would give 3.  Rooms are a bit dated but bed was comfortable.  Living room furniture was not the most comfortable but we weren't in the  room too much  anyway.   Liked the fireplace and view was excellent.  I get up earlier than my husband so the king suite was perfect for us - I could make coffee and sit on the balcony to view the rocks.    Parking was ok but could tell at the height of busy season that could be a challenge.    Liked being smack dab in downtown - lots of places to walk to and again, views were awesome.   My husband thought the towels smelled like a locker room gym towel from high school and the shower was slippery and when we requested a nonslip art it took hours for them to find one.  I'd still stay again but maybe with my sister not my husband !!!What a value!  Scenic views of the red rocks from every balcony and was in a prime location in uptown Sedona. Lacking the last star because the pool area is not very impressive and there was no workout facilities. Rooms were extremely spacious. Great for couples or families!Cute rooms and centrally located.  If you are looking for a cabin this place is not it.  But if you want pretty mountain views this is a great place.  It has a nice fireplace and nice views.  Reasonably pricedWhat a great hotel! The staff and service were excellent. Great proximity to eating and shopping in uptown Sedona. We stayed in Suite 403 and the view was amazing. The room was spacious and the fireplace was a nice touch. Only minor complaints were the pillows were hard as a rock (we will be bringing our own next time we stay here!) and the walls are a little thin so we could hear doors slamming and when other people's showers were running. But those were minor things and we'll definitely be back despite those small issues!We stayed here for two nights while visiting Sedona and it was in a beautiful location! Tucked away in the mountainside, the red rocks provide a gorgeous back drop. Our room was on the second floor and our balcony provided a panoramic view of the mountain. The fire place was going and the music was playing when we checked in. I love that the room is more than just the beds and it feels more spacious with the additional sofas and coffee table. They also have multiple sinks, 3 in total, which makes it easy and more convenient for a family of 4 to get ready. The hotel is located right in the middle of town, so you can walk to various restaurants and shops. Breakfast is served at the Mexican restaurant nearby and included only cold items, such as muffins, bread, yogurt, instant oatmeal, cereal, and fruit. I was hoping for some scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon but the closest thing was some cold boiled eggs. I guess if you come in with no expectations, the food isn't so bad. They have juices, milk, and coffee. Everything else makes up for the lackluster breakfast!Absolutely amazing views, regardless of the time of day. Great parking, nice and cozy rooms, and right in the heart of Sedona which means food is within walking distance. They also have some great discounts and promotions for returning visitors, which is awesome - I'll happily take any excuse to come back to Sedona.I Was on a business trip from Pittsburgh to Irvine California for a month I decided to drive .. With stops in Missouri, El Paso ,and Sedona , wow Sedona is so beautiful must see to believe. I spent one night at the Orchards inn , that I booked months ahead of time but had to spend another night just for the beauty. Staff rocks , Very nice  Bonus in the middle of the small town. This watering Stop Rocks.The views are ridiculous! My husband and I have been traveling cross country and booking hotels usually a couple of hours before. I booked this hotel because the pictures showed some great views. We ended up arriving at night and the best part of our trip so far was waking up at Orchards Inn a d looking out the window. Amazing! We ended up drinking a cup of coffee on the balcony and watching the sun rise. Whenever we make our way back to Sedona,  we will definitely stop by Orchards Inn again!Great location and awesome view from our room. This is our first time staying here and second time to Sedona. We come in the winter because my bf likes cold weather.  The fireplace in the room is a good touch and romantic.  Free continental breakfast, basic, all carbs only protein was hard bolied eggs but it's enough to get you through the morning. In walking distance to restaurants and shopping.  We will definitely be staying here again.The Orchard inn is perfect!  We stayed here for two nights after a business meeting in Phoenix.  We were on the 3rd floor with amazing views of the red rocks from our private balcony.  There was also a fireplace in our room.  They have complimentary bottled water, coffee and tea 24/7 in the lobby.  They also have a computer in the lobby to print your boarding pass (all free).  Their breakfast (served at the restaurant across the parking lot) was your typical buffet, nothing hot, but plenty of fruit, breads, muffins and cereals.  You won't leave hungry.  The beds were very comfortable with cozy down comforters.  We loved that it was so close to everything. You can park your car in their lot and never have to drive again, everything was within walking distance.  We will definitely stay here again!AMAZING views. The desk was super helpful, and the room was clean. We showed up an hour before check in and they accommodated us right away by moving our room to one that was ready, which I thought was really helpful. They also lent us a corkscrew because we didn't have one (and the wine shop across the street didn't sell them because ""there's no manufacturers in AZ that make them."" Had to laugh). On that note, though, this place is really conveniently located, tucked away off the main drag in uptown, it's a short walk to a lot of great little shops. The beds were comfy, pillows a bit on the firm side. Showers were a bit dated. But let's be honest, you're staying here for the views. We sat on the patio the whole time we were in the room, just turned the music channel up a bit and sat outside.I'll definitely be returning.Visiting a friend in AZ for a long weekend and we chose the Orchards Inn for our overnight in Sedona. We were excited to check in after a long hike. The guy at the counter was friendly and took care of us quickly and painlessly. We booked a two queen room and it was wonderful. Clean, tastefully decorated, spacious, and a postcard view. I enjoyed a cup of the complementary coffee enjoying the view from the balcony after waking up. Room rate also included the breakfast buffet at the Canyon Breeze restaurant  which is only a minutes walk from the hotel. Definitely more than I could ask for in an inclusive hotel breakfast. Starbucks coffee and plenty of choices! I would definitely stay here again!Great hotel! My family and I enjoyed staying here and it was good value. The pool was a lot of fun for my daughter, and the room had a gorgeous view. The traffic can be crazy getting out to the main road, but that can't be helped. We would definitely stay here again!I give this 4.5 stars only because of this one simple thing- for the price of the room, the breakfast should have been a smidge better. It wasn't terrible-don't get me wrong- I just expected a little more I guess. Otherwise, the room was immaculate and amazing. The views of the red rocks from our personal balcony was incredible! The pool was clean and a nice cool treat after a hot day. The jacuzzi was an extra added plus! I could have stayed at the pool area all day! The location is perfect-right in the center if awsome uptown Sedona. In addition, the hotel gives you a 10%off coupon to the mexican place directly in front of the inn. This is also where you eat breakfast. I fully enjoyed my stay at Orchards Inn and highly recommend them for an amazing room with scenic views with top notch location.Although this hotel is a little hidden from the outside, it's right in the heart of Uptown Sedona. Literally within walking distance of all the shopping and restaurants, this hotel also has EXCELLENT views of the natural beauty of Arizona. The room is updated, clean, and romantic with a deck and a fireplace. Absolutely love this hotel and everything that came with it. Breakfast is above average and the front desk is very helpful to point you to local attractions. Will definitely stay here again!I am giving it only 3 stars because of slow wifi and a shower that will not stay a constant temperature. It is not a lot of fun to have a shower that goes from perfect temperature, to cold, to scalding. The room is very suitable for anyone.The front desk is very helpful and very courteous. Also the view is amazing and you will be pleased by the location.The views.......Great place! Was in town for a wedding a we flip flopped where to stay.  On a whim we picked orchards. Room had a balcony with great views which I thought was the best part of staying here.The walls are a little thin b/c  i woke up to my loud neighbors opening and closing doors at 3am. We called the front desk bc we didn't want to be those people but the hotel took care if I bc things settled down a few minutes after and we didn't hear a peep after.We had reservations at a different hotel that didn't work out... While sitting in our car in Sedona searching for option B we stumbled across Orchards Inn due to quality Yelp reviews/rating and reasonable pricing.  From first interaction with the staff to checkout we were extremely satisfied.  We explained our plan B situation to the hotel staff at check-in and they cared enough to give us a call once we had settled in to make sure we were happy.  And we were... the views from our room and hot tub were picturesque.  The walk to Pink Jeep, L' Auberge for dinner and shops was ideal.  Overall great stay and would recommend as an accommodating, cozy, and convenient stay! Thanks!From the outside it did not seem like much to look at. We had been staying in hotels for the last six nights, so this one seemed like s standard (all be it well kept) motel from the street. The desk attendant was very friendly and gave me our keys. There are no elevators here, but it is not that bad since the hotel is on a hill, so the ""ground"" floor you first see is actually the second floor, and you can choose to go down a flight of stairs to get to the first floor or up to get to the third (where our room was). Like many motels, there is a continuous balcony outside the room entrances on the third floor. Our room was right at the top of the stairs, 304. I crossed my fingers and slid in the key, hoping not to be let down. We were not let down. The room was newly remodeled and much wider than a standard hotel room. It felt like there would be plenty of room for all three of us to spread out, even with two queen beds. There was a gas fireplace (not that we need that in May). The decor was very clean and modern, and the bathroom was a good size. But what caught our attention more than any of that, was the view off our private balcony. Picture turning your head 90 degrees left, and slowly panning through 180 degrees of majestic red rock cliffs lit perfectly by the afternoon sun, with the tops of pine trees almost directly beneath you. We were speechless, then giddy. We spent every sunset sitting on our balcony watching the cliffs change colors. You can even see them perfectly from the Inn's hot tub. It was so relaxing and made us fall instantly in love with Sedona. The hotel offers a free breakfast which was very nice and welcome in an expensive town like Sedona. You just walk across the parking lot and enter Tao's Cantina from the back door, where they have a room with a buffet set up. It is just continental fare, not true ""hot"" food except what you can fit in the toaster, but there was still a good variety and it was a great way to start each day. Tip: There is an awesome apricot tree right behind the cantina. If you're there in may and you've got somebody with you who can jump - grab a couple when nobody is looking - they are delicious!We will definitely come back to Orchards Inn if we are ever in Sedona. One of the best experiences of our entire trip!","Great hotel, great deal! Until you leave something in the room and never see it again... And don't expect much from customer service. Unfortunate. These people have too much faith in the honesty of their housekeeping.The view was breathtaking! It was a great value given the location. We asked for directions to our next destination at the front desk and the man was so knowledgeable and hospitable! We had a wonderful time there and would definitely return again!WOW!! I got room here thru Sedona resorts only $62!! Beautiful room with incredible view of canyon and with fireplace. Even has backyard grass area for Toto!! Awesome!! I'll be coming back here for sure!! Even get full breakfast in morning &amp; 25% discount at Taos Cantina restaurant in front. AND it's in center of town PURRFECT for walking &amp; shopping!!We have been coming here for years and have not had a bad experience. The staff is helpful and friendly. The rooms are pretty basic but very clean and tidy. The biggest draw to this property is the location and the view off the balcony-awesome- great for sipping a margarita or a glass of wine. It is located right in the middle of town close to all the shops and restaurant's/bars perfect in case you have one too many prickly pear margaritas' and your friends have to drag you back to the room! oops hate it when that happens. Has a small pool and spa available as well that is nice when you get back from a day of hiking.  Great place to stay.Stayed at the Orchards Inn for a family destination wedding and was very impressed. The view from the room is awe inspiring. Refreshing continental breakfast every morning. Don't forget a swimsuit - the pool setting is relaxing.The location of this hotel was excellent. Right in uptown with easy access to all the restaurants, bars and shops. It was cold when we went so the outdoor pool and hot tub were not that appealing, but we did enjoy the in room fire place and large balcony with views. It's worth the value if you're looking for a place in town. Our oh complaint was the water pressure left something to be desired, and the hot water didn't last through 2 showers.Absolutley amazing Inn.  The rooms are clean and fresh.. Balcony views are breathtaking and perfect for the morning cup of coffee or evening wine.  You can hear the fast moving creek down below.  So close to all the fun shops and coffee stops.  Park your car and walk!    I will book here again and highly recommend it for your weekend get away.Great views and great value for the traveler willing to sacrifice some amenities. There are tons of overpriced hotels in Sedona that offer all kinds of amenities for your stay, but you likely will walk into your room at the Orchards Inn and feel like you overpaid. That is until you see the view from your room... so beautiful to wake up to. Also, some areas are pet friendly! Very nice to be able to bring our pup along. Our goal was to spend the time in nature with Sedona, so this modest hotel was cozy and convenient so come back to at the end of the day.The one thing I did not like was the references of Orchard Inns breakfast. When we arrived at the lobby curious about the breakfast it was packets of oatmeal, some drinks, and fruit. Definitely not a breakfast - more like snacks for your morning hike. Very centrally located in downtown Sedona (tucked away behind the plazas of the main drag). Easy walk away from restaurants and drinks.Orchards Inn is a wonderful hidden treasure. We stayed there on impulse while visiting Sedona for a relaxation, rejuvenation, reflection road trip. The hotel is a small, quaint, modest property with an awesome view of the canyon. The rooms were clean, spacious, and modern; although the tub/shower could use a bit of remodeling (not a show stopper by any means). The property is located in a terrific area right on the main drag, highway 89A, and in walking distance of all the shops and restaurants in the immediate area. Although the property is close to the main drag, the area is quiet and peaceful. The grounds are beautiful and perfect for taking a long walk. The pool and Jacuzzi area were clean and relaxing as well.The staff was amazing!!!! Every member the Orchards Inn team treated us like family. They were accommodating, professional, knowledgeable, and friendly beyond our expectations. Margarita and Charles made our guest experience superb!!!!!I will definitely stay at the Orchards Inn again.... and again.... and again :-)I give Orchards Inn five stars for the value.  The rooms are large and each one has a balcony or patio overlooking L'Auberge below on Oak Creek and across to an amazing view of the red rock formations that tower above the creek.  I have stayed here twice now and each time the rooms were clean and expansive with a little kitchen area and a large bathroom.  The swimming pool is small but in a very pleasant setting with vegetation growing on the fence.  There is also a very good hot tub for resting after a hike.  It is convenient to downtown Sedona with all the tourist shops and there is a beautiful walk to L'Auberge for creekside dining.  Pretty good wifi as well.Great views, great location and very good management.  Rooms are outdated and the breakfast was average. Had an issue arise with the room and the staff was very attentive and made it right.......well done.  Would stay there again for the view and location.Great views from rooms.   Good downtown location.  Clean spacious room. It's priceyWant a place with a great view this is it want a place that cleans your room this is not the place to stay.spent 10/31 thru 11/3 and had to ask for fresh towels since got no room service. Lots of places with good views but only this one doesn't clean your roomYou are paying for the view/locationBest Features:Room is spaciousSpectacular view of mountains/RedRocksWalking distance to restaurants and shopsCentrally locatedConvenient parkingDog friendly rooms with attached/gated grass Worst Features: Upon arrival price was listed as 50.00 less /night online then when we had purchased the room.  However, hotel would not match the listed online priceYou can hear EVERYTHING from your neighbors. (TV, talking, singing in the shower, walking)  Every time we tried to sleep something would wake us up. You can hear a constant hum of other hotel AC's in the valley below the balconies.Pool area is BEYOND packed, and very small   Rooms are old and feel like 90's timeshareWhite crusty stains on couch pillows......Eeeewwwwww!Feels very overpriced!The facilities/interior feel run down and the Red Rock King Suite feels shabby and more like a motel. For $250+ I was expecting something a lot more luxurious and if I had known this is what the facilities would be like I would of either spent more at L'Auberge or saved money and stayed at one of the chain hotels. Overall not impressed. Not $250 worth fort sure!View is gorgeous! Rooms are outdated but fit the ambience of Sedona. The beds are uncomfortable, the shower was hot then cold, the paint chipping and door cracked. Parking lot is tight. We were surprised how early everything closes.Love coming here! The views are amazing and your smack in the middle of uptown which is great for walking around town getting ice cream or a margarita and a little souvenir shopping. Rooms are always clean and comfortable.  Have been coming here for years and last time I was there ( April 2014) something had changed in management... the breakfast that was included in your room rate used to be amazing and this last time it was just plan sad. We walked in and no lights were on, the store bought pastries were lacking and there was no serve ware so who knows whos fingers had touched the food before you! What happened to the eggs, waffle maker, fruit, juice and coffee?Everything perfect. Front desk was very helpful. Had a great view of the redrocks. within walking distance of restaurants and shops. We were going to stay only one night but enjoyed it so much we stayed over one more night. Large rooms, clean, we would definitely go back.I just want to give 5 stars to the great hospitality from the front desk team: Juan and Tyler. My family needed to wait for the shuttle to the airport here and they were so welcoming and courteous. They offered water and let us just sit and enjoy the nice lounge overlooking the beautiful canyon. If i ever get the chance i would stay here for a visit too. Thanks guys! Au revoir~This is a great hotel if you're visiting Sedona and want to be active in-town and out of town. It's not far from the various hikes and parks, and is conveniently located in downtown Sedona with ample parking for guests. We got a great rate on our room for booking in advance, and it came with free breakfast. The rooms aren't all that fancy but generally clean and the beds are comfortable...and the view from the rooms are stunning! With all the amazing things to do in Sedona, there isn't any reason to spend a significant amount of time in your room anyways.  Breakfast was quite good, considering it was free for us though the $13 per adult that's charged otherwise is quite a good deal considering Sedona prices. There are hot eggs, potatoes, meats, a waffle bar, bread, bagels, pancakes, breakfast burritos, cereal, fruit (that was all good &amp; fresh), yogurt, and oatmeal...definitely something for everyone. And the cafeteria has a stunning view of the red rocks like the hotel.My only complaint is that we got a noise complaint for talking normally in our room...the walls are very thin and you cannot sleep in here because of the ruckus that starts around 7 am with people getting up and moving around. But otherwise, this is a great place to stay!","I am giving 5 stars for customer service. When we were originally supposed to stay at The Orchards in May, the Slide Fire was blazing in Sedona and we decides to reschedule our stay on a different day. The clerks were very helpful in booking a new day for us. The evening before we were going to head up there for our stay, my husband had a medical emergency and we couldn't go. Fearing it was less than 24-hours before we were set to arrive, I thought we would be facing a fee. Once again the clerks were very kind and helpful in canceling our room... No fee charged! They happily rebooked us for a few weeks from now. Such a flexible and customer-centered place. I appreciate their help and we are looking forward to our vacation at The Orchards even more now!This place is such a wonderful value. For nearly the same price as other middle-of-the-road establishments, you get wonderful front desk service, clean and quite nice rooms, and million dollar views...extraordinary. Will be staying here next time I'm visiting Sedona. Also located in the middle of town, so convenient to shopping, dining, and tours. Free breakfast also is great - waffles, Denver omelettes, fruit, etc...Front desk staff is polite, helpful, and will make you copies of maps for popular local sights and hikes.My husband and I spent a night here after searching thru some other options in the area. We were so happy we chose this place. The views from our room were breathtaking overlooking the red mountains. Super clean room, easy check-in, amazingly helpful and friendly staff. For a little over $100/night, we would absolutely stay here again. It's within walking distance to tons of shops and restaurants but set back just enough so that your not on the main road. The complimentary breakfast was good- your basics were all there. Pancakes, bacon, fruit, waffles, yogurt, cereal etc.Sickest views ever. Wonderful rooms with fireplaces.Pet friendly, make sure you ask for the doggie yard! It's sick.We had a really pleasant stay here as it was exactly what we were looking for in terms of location and comfort. Most important is getting a room on the second floor towards the middle. The view is amazing and gave us excellent photography images day and night. We wanted to do some night photography without freezing. We set our cameras on tripods and got some great shots with the mountains and stars. Luckily Olympus has a wifi app that works with several high end models. I could take shots from the warmth of the fireplace inside. The hotel itself was quiet and the rooms were generally clean. They are pricey but in comparison to some of the high end resort type hotels, it is reasonable. Go here if your a photo buff and want to be close enough to walk the town.Lovely rooms, very convenient, discounts for dining and a free buffet breakfast, too! Our King Mini Suite had amazing views, a fireplace, crisp clean linens and real coffee cups! The room was clean and comfortable, and the staff was warm, friendly and helpful.A great choice in the heart of Uptown Sedona! I. Can't wait to come back.Loved being right downtown, with everything (with the exception of hiking) just a walk away. The Inn was cute, and the staff was very nice. Great views from our room, probably from all the rooms as they all face the mountain views. The only windows they have (at least in our room) was the door, so at night you can't have any windows open for fresh air. A little lacking in their continental breakfast, perhaps it's a space issue since the lobby is very small. I would definitely stay here again, great location.Just arrived after 9 hours on the road.  Rooms are clean &amp; comfortable, location is great for easy access to local restaurants.   Unfortunately we received a less than friendly welcome from Kelly, the front desk clerk.  It seemed like we may have interrupted her break.  We asked if we could have adjoining rooms, our request was met with a frosty response.  We mentioned our reservation included a roll away &amp; she seemed to take pleasure in telling us it was not included, but she would get one delivered.  It's a shame that what appears to be a great hotel has someone with Kelly's attitude ""greeting"" the guests!This hotel gets five stars for the location and the view.  To me, that is exactly what I was paying for.  It is a basic hotel on the inside, and has most amenities one might need for a one night stay.  Two tiny issues:  I could hear other hotel doors shutting in the morning.  That is what woke me up!  Thoughtful guests could make a small effort and  close the doors without making noise, but sadly, not everyone is thoughtful, including, evidently, those who were near my room.   I think the hotel should recognize that not all of their guests have common courtesy, and do whatever it takes to make the room doors close silently-- sound proofing, a sign reminding guests to shut the door quietly, or whatever else other hotels do to eliminate this problem.   The other issue is that there is no snack vending machine.  The shops in uptown close very early, (5-7 p.m.) and there was nowhere to get a snack.  We drove to a Circle K in west Sedona to get a bag of chips. That could easily have been solved with a vending machine.  Not a deal breaker, but an easy fix, so I hope the owners are reading this.  Back to my original statement:  The location and view are what earned the five stars.For the price this place is as good as it gets.  The beds are comfortable, the views are spectacular, the office staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the continental breakfast is very acceptable.   The hotel is close to shops and attractions.  I would definitely recommend this place and plan to come back myself.  One note:  The hotel does not have an elevator to upper levels.  Just make sure you ask for a street level room and no elevator is needed.Simple but clean and well maintained rooms. Very friendly, accommodating service. Decent wifi. Amazing, spectacular views and the rooms all face the valley away from the parking lot and street so it's surprisingly quiet. Steps from the central shops and dining in Sedona, so it's an ideal location.Up until recently, this was our ""little secret"" in Sedona. Recently purchased by the ownership group who runs L'Auberge, every single room has an awesome view of the red rocks. Back in the day, you could easily get in with late notice and pay $130 for a king sized room with fireplace. Now you can expect to pay closer to $200 per night! But man, the views are spectacular and each spot has a patio or balcony to enjoy! You sit right on top of the hill that looks down into L'Auberge and Amara Resort. There are trails you can take around the property that are beautiful. The rooms are clean and have been recently renovated. The beds are comfortable, wish I could say the same for pillows. The rooms are large in size and we've always had an auto fireplace, which is a nice touch during the cooler months. The location is great- in uptown Sedona and within walking distance to some great restaurants (Cowboy Club)  and shops. Yes, this is a pretty touristy area but whatever, it's fun to people watch- lots to see and window shop. You have options to buy snacks at certain places on 89A like bottled water for the fridge in your room. Free wi-fi available and a high def plasma with DVD if that's your thing.Great views for sure from the rooms. The ""healthy"" breakfast is sugary packaged instant oatmeal you add hot water to and mix yourself, hard boiled eggs or sugary pastries. Set up in a dirty dark Mexican restaurant. Not what I expected at the room rate.I came too Arizona to visit my best friend.  We decided to go to Sedona to see the beautiful scenery of the Red Rocks.  We chose another location at first and then two days later cancelled and booked the last room available on Expedia.  We arrived and Kevin the front desk guys was very friendly and gave us a warm greeting and sent us off to our room. I booked a single standard king room and was given a 2queen bed room which it was very clean and it felt like home!!! We'll in the middle of the night the room was 80' degrees and too hot for me, the A/C did not work either! My boyfriend went up to the front desk and ran into Charles the General Mgr.  He was Awesome!!! My friend told him that he would not want his best friend to say anything about her stay at this hotel on any website! So?????? Then Charles the manager gave us a suite to stay in for the next night! No extra charge for it either!!!! Pretty Cool! Loved it! The suite was comfy and the service was awesome! I highly recommend this place to stay when visiting Sedonna Arizona!!!!!!Hands down the best view for the value.  The check in was quick (and they allowed an early check in).  The room was clean with a big comfy bed and nice balcony with an amazing view of the mountains.  The locations is also great as there are tons of little shops and restaurants all located within walking distance.  When we return to Sedona we will be sure to stay at Orchards Inn.Rooms are uneventful and tired.  This place needs to be updated.  Service at front desk needs improvement.  That said, the view from the room and deck is great.  Location is very good.This is by far an amazing hotel. The price is great for the area and the high quality of rooms. Spend a little extra for the prime view when booking- it's worth it! The staff are friendly too!Very pleasant stay.  I had my travel agent book me a room in Sedona, they did a terrible job because they booked me in the worst MOTEL in Sedona.  My friends and I decided to try our luck and see if we could find availability despite it being a Saturday and the busy season.  We first went to the Best Western and were charged $240 for the night.  I found this to be excessive but wasn't feeling too confident I'd find anything with just as good of a view for any less.  I then went to the Orchard Inn and they had the same view and charged me $140 a night.  I was very happy with this price and booked the room.  The room was very clean, came with a fireplace and a gorgeous view of the rocks.  Also walking distance to all the very nice little shops, restaurants and boutiques that downtown Sedona has to offer.  I would definitely stay here again.  Also, if you wake up early enough, head up the Airport Trail and watch the sunrise over the rocks, less than a mile from the hotel.Made a good pick when we were looking for a hotel to stay on our weekend trip to Sedona. We checked in late on a Saturday night and the guy at the counter was very friendly and attentive. Our room was nice and clean and worth the rate. We did think that the room we got had a fireplace so we were a little disappointed when it didn't, but we lived on. The tables on the balcony was nice and the views in the morning were amazing. We did have their free breakfast buffet which was worth the $12 or so we would have saved for breakfast. It was centrally located on main street which was really nice since we didn't have to drive more than necessary. I would definitely stay here again.Great views, comfortable beds and friendly staff. Parking was an issue, as there were no spots available when I arrived. However, the friendly staff helped me find a space by walking out and standing in the parking space to save it for me. Will be going back. The views from the balcony can't be beat!","We stayed two nights this past weekend and I was pleasantly surprised at the comfort of the room.  I knew the view would be incredible, and it was.  The front desk staff were great.  We asked about hikes and got some great advice on which ones we would like.  I would give it a 5 star, except the bathroom was okay not great.  It needs to be updated.I stayed here in November 2011 and was very disappointed. The room that we stayed in was nothing like the photos on the website. The ""suite"" was like the first place you rent when you are in college. Very basic, boring, and you were afraid to touch anything.The walls were so thin, you could hear the neighbors TV, phone calls, talking, and I even heard the guy snoring!! Needless to say, I didn't get any sleep! I seriously felt like I wasn't in a safe place. I was thankful that I was only there for one night, and I left first thing in the morning.The staff was really nice and the views are wonderful, but I will never stay here again.This hotel is located in a perfect spot on the north end of Sedona. Dining and shopping are in walking distance. The rooms could use some updating but are clean and have AWESOME  views. The staff is friendly and it is very relaxed here. Ask for the older wing as it is by the pool. You can drive right by this place so when you see the pink jeep tours, you are there. Ask for a 2nd or 3rd floor room for more privacy. Great place, will stay again.Centrally located, very friendly staff, reasonable rates, nice smaller pool and spa make this a great place to stay when visiting Sedona. Even comes with a free buffet at the restaurant next door. We will be coming back. Minus one star because the interior of our room, while clean and in good condition, could use some upgrading.I really enjoyed our stay at Orchards.  It is an affordable and simple hotel with an INCREDIBLE view.  The staff were friendly, helpful and kind.  It's a no frills kind of place, meaning no room service, jacuzzi tub or robes, but the room was clean and welcoming.  We got exactly what we expected and were very happy during our stay.  We did not use the pool, but others seemed to loved it and were using it nightly.  It is situated right above their sister hotel, L'Auberge de Sedona.  You can walk from Orchards to the L'Auberge property.  It is a 10 minute walk to the creek that runs through L'Auberge's property, which is spectacular. Orchards is located uptown, right in the middle of everything so you can walk to restaurants, shops and to the tour offices (we used pink jeep and it was great).  We will come back for sure!We had a lovely stay at Orchards Inn. We booked a suite for our family of four. Although another reviewer stated they didn't have a view with their suite, we had a lovely view. It seems that there is another building of suites that doesn't have the view, so it may be worth asking when you book. Pros:- Location, location, location!  The hotel is right downtown, we could walk to dinner each night, and as I already mentioned there are wonderful views of the red rocks. - Big suite, lots of room to spread out. - Price was great for a suite in Sedona- The pool was heated and also had great views. We didn't use the one by the suites, so I can't comment on that. - Free buffet breakfast was pretty good. Cons: - Low water pressure in the shower. I have a lot of hair, so that's a big one for me. - Thin floors. We were on the second floor, and when we first got there our kids were a bit wiggly and playing a game in the room. The neighbors complained--at 4:30 in the afternoon, so we weren't keeping them awake. We told the kids to settle down, but when we were paying attention we could tell that unless they walked quietly we could feel their footsteps reverberate. - Blinds in the living room didn't block the light well, so our kids woke up at 6am each morning. Even with the cons, we will stay here again if we travel back to Sedona.Nice hotel, great location, and magical views from the room.  Was very happy with the experience, especially since I only payed about $130 for a double queen with a lovely view.This is a great hotel.I was pleasantly surprised when we checked in.  The lobby was small but elegant, and the staff friendly.  We had to wait a bit after checking in because they were still preparing our room, but the front desk agent took my cell phone number and said that she would call once it opened.  I thought that this was thoughtful of her.Being on the first floor, I worried that the view from our room would be subpar.  I was so, so wrong.  It was tremendous.  You get the most amazing views at this hotel, for a price that is really reasonable.  We paid $109/night in August because we checked in on a weekday.Room furnishings are tasteful.  Two sinks in the bathroom!  (Nice!)  Great pool area with hot tub.Now to the breakfast.  The selection was pretty typical for your mid-range hotel: scrambled eggs, waffle maker, assorted pastries.  However, God is in the details, and the Orchards Inn got a lot of the details right.  Bacon: super crispy!  Homemade granola: crunchy and nutty with pumpkin seeds and hazelnuts!  Salsa: fresh and delicious!  Coffee: strong and flavorful!  I do wish that they had mixed it up a bix with the selection. There could have been a few healthier options like oatmeal, too.  Service in the restaurant and front desk was consistently excellent.  They went above and beyond.Wish I were back there!  Thanks for a great stay!Comfortable rooms, friendly staff, exquisite views, great free food, location, good pricing!!Would definitely stay here again.Amazing for the money! I stayed here for one night by myself and felt completely safe, had the best view, love the outdoor balcony, staff is friendly, couldn't have asked for more. It's also in a great location!Fantastic hotel in Sedona with terrific views and was reasonably priced. FREE WIFI in the rooms is a great perk. The FREE breakfast buffet is incredible! Would stay here again in a heartbeat.It is in the middle of tourist central Sedona.  If that's where you want to be located then this is a good choice.  The room that we stayed in was not exactly what one would expect based on the picture.  The unit was more or less a glorified one bedroom apt. with no kitchen.  The amenities were spartan and the decor was dated.  The ultimate plus that this place has going for it are the views.  They were great.Great customer service.  Clean room.  Awesome view, and got a discount at check out because it was only a partial view, still beautiful though. Highly recommend. Best westerns rate was more expensive.I have stayed here a few times and it is always a great deal. Every room has a view, breakfast is included and is actually pretty good. The location is amazing, literally footsteps from the main-street in Sedona. My only complaints are that the WiFi is pretty much un-usable (as are most hotels) and my room wasnt ready by 3pm (check-in time). Other than that, I love this place.The Orchards Inn is a nice, clean comfortable hotel. It is no where near a Motel 6 but it is not a luxury hotel either.  If you are looking for a nice accomodationss reasonably priced with a good breaklfast included then this is the place. The staff was great, the views were spectacular and it was in the heart of downtown Sedona, walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  It's a great location for all area activities. If fluffy sheets and bedcoveres are your priority then go pay triple down the street. Honestly I don't know who goes to Sedona to sit in a hotel room anyway.Great room, great location, great views, great front desk staff!Beautiful view.  Room is clean-nothing over the top-but the view... Dang!these raving reviews are making me suspicious of Yelp. I read them before I came here and they played a big role in my decision to stay here.  What a disappointment.  Let me give you the straight scoop.  The hotel is basically a Motel 6 with a great view.  Seriously.  Not bad, but if you are staying in Sedona you can do much better for the money. Have low expectations and you will be fine.  Motel 6 level.  straight up.In a cross-country road trip with my daughter, we stopped in Sedona to take in the unique beauty of the area and visit the Canyon.  While in the area, we stayed at the Orchards, Inn.The pluses:  the views, the staff, the views, the impeccable service, the views.The minuses:  we only got to stay there 1 night and had a late evening check-in so we missed the evening views; decor is somewhat plain.I felt we got really good value for the price (which included a wonderful Sunday brunch) and wished we had a longer stay in the area.p.s.  A few weeks after our visit, my daughter and son drove from Chicago to California and detoured through the Sedona area.  They also stopped at Orchards Inn and enjoyed it the 2nd time around too.  My daughter thought it was just as nice the 2nd time around....My husband and I absolutely loved our stay here. The rooms have wonderful, amazing views right from your balcony. The front desk staff were all so helpful and friendly. Little extras are nice such as keeping refrigerated water bottles for guests in the lobby. Nice pool and jacuzzi. It's not a 5 star hotel if you need luxury, but it is still quite accommodating. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet provided each morning. It's also right in the middle of everything so you can enjoy shopping or any necessities without driving. The Orchards Inn of Sedona met all of our needs. We would definitely stay here again!","['second', 'year', 'back', 'orchards', 'inn', 'first', 'experience', 'last', 'year', 'deserved', 'star', 'review', 'effortlessly', 'booking', 'check', 'perfect',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-pi%C3%B1on-pointe-sedona-2,Hyatt Piñon Pointe,4.0,$$$,61,"The pool and spa areas are well kept with beautiful views of the red rocks.  The gym and activity center are nicely stocked and coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are freely available.  The staff is competent.  DVD's and board games are complementary.  The resort is well-located in uptown Sedona so you can walk right to the shops and restaurants and then retire back to the comfort of your unit.  We are a family of five and stayed in a 2 bedroom unit.  The beds in the bedrooms definitely need to be replaced.  The sofa-bed is surprisingly good.  The unit has nice balconies.  I think the big problem is that the sitting room is very small. W-Fi was good enough and free. The TV is a little hard to use if you want to switch from TV mode to DVD mode.  Not a big deal though.  Apart from that, it is a very nice place.This would be a 4 star review except for the poor quality of staff. The hotel itself is nice apart from flaws such as joining rooms, which means you hear all noise from the adjoining room. It makes me sad to write this review as 2 previous stays here were quite good. But due to this experience, Hyatt Sedona Pinon Pointe has lost a good customer.The front office staff are lazy and unwilling to do what's needed to give customers a Hyatt quality experience. We had been guaranteed an early check in, but on arriving we were asked to go have lunch, as the room would not be ready for a while. Only after we asked to speak with the manager were we given a room that have been clean since the night before. Shouldn't a good quality employee have suggested this on his own?The room is good, but beds are very poor and should be replaced. Studio rooms have thin walls and due to the connecting doors means that all noise from the room next door easily carries through. If you're happy to share a room with the grunts, farts and coughs of your neighbor, go ahead and book it!But for most normal people, I strongly recommend skipping this hotel.We stayed here for two nights. When I read Yelpers reviews I thought we won't enjoy staying here BUT...we had a great time! The hotel is nice, our room was cleanand has a nice view. The housekeeping came and cleaned our room (I read one of the reviews that there was no housekeeping).The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. The pool was my favorite area. Nice pool with overlooking Sedona.They have pool table, table tennis, BBQ area, Fire pit. Walking distance to uptown Sedona. Easy access from everywhere. Overall we enjoyed our stay.Well kept property! Very beautiful! Perfect for a nice family getaway! Have everything and much more. Stayed at the 1 Bedroom Suite! Living room with a fire place, coffee table, couch, glass door to the balcony with a dining table outside! Washer &amp; dryer.. Full on kitchen with an island and a large dining table/booth. Bathroom is huge! Double vanity sink, large shower with a seat.. Hot tub jacuzzi! Bedroom with a door access to the balcony! Amazing! Oh wait! 2 t.v's :)This Hyatt is situated in the heart of Sedona with wonderful views of the mountains and the rocks. We got two rooms on top of the hill with wide spacious balconies overlooking the breath-taking scenery of Sedona. The bigger room had washer and dryer in unit, a full size fridge, a dishwasher, a coffee maker, a dining table, a fireplace, and a jakuzi. The smaller room had a mini fridge and a coffee maker. Both rooms were sparkling clean when we arrived and every day after the maid service. All employees were very knowledgable, friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay here again!The views are nice, the pool is pretty, the clubhouse is pretty cool but that's about all this place has going for it. The rooms are tiny, the cleaning service is not all that, they don't have room service and certainly don't bring your kids (big mistake). They are not kid friendly and it's more of a retirement community. Believe me, nothing wrong with a retirement community just not good for a family with kids.We used a friends time share to stay here for a week. We got the two bedroom, which was very spacious for our family of four. We stocked up on groceries and had several meals in the room. Everything was provided right down to the corkscrew to open our locally produced wine. The hot tubs were great and we enjoyed the beautiful views of the night sky. The fitness center provides complimentary books, DVDs and coffee. We did not do the time share pitch and were not at all pressured to do it. The concierge was very nice and helpful as was the front desk staff.Super super super! Really enjoy coming, usually just stay at the resort most of the time!Make sure you pick up food before 7 pm, everything in Sedona closes!5 stars for hotels in this price range. Enchantment Resort would be the 5 star for the area though. If you're looking for something cheaper, Best Western looked pretty clean from the outside and it's in a great location. I'm glad I chose the Hyatt over the Hilton - the Hilton is very far from the town.As far as the Hyatt, I have no complaints. The front desk and concierge were very friendly and efficient. The location is excellent - walking distance to restaurants and tourist area. Our room had a great view of the pool and red rocks. The bathroom was large and clean. Our bed was firm and there was a nice thick mattress on the sofa bed as well. It was nice having a washer, dryer and refrig/freezer in the room. The pool was well designed and there is a separate wading pool for little kids and two jacuzzis. Wish we could have stayed longer. Would definitely stay there again.Giving one star as there is no option to give none !In short, this is Motel 6 under Hyatt name. Does Hyatt know this ?Got very nice view of parking lot!Room was not cleaned when we returned end of the day -- was told that housekeeping was busy..Some lights did not work.Confusing TV channels .. useless programming.Nice 2 hour presentation of a time share and as a gift they gave us $100 visa card to be used only at gas stations. Why gas only - I didn't know. We used the card twice saving us about $30 on gas. The third time the card would not work and I tried it at a couple locations. Checked the balance and it was $0.00  Rip - offThe time-share presentation was OK and the price was almost fair and we were mildly interested but the lack of time share space where we wanted to be was a major stop sign and now this freebie trouble. Can't believe Hyatt tarnishes it's name with this flim-flam game.We stayed here for a week mid July. Exchanged our timeshare. Came up from Phoenix.  We'll start with the good..  fabulous location,  pretty surroundings,  great views from most rooms that I can tell. Concierge very helpful. They check in to see if you need any thing, nicely decorated,  pool and pool views spectacular,  shops, Starbucks, wildflower bakery close to rooms. Great venue for kids 'camp runamucka', not cheap, but has activities for the kiddos. The sofa beds are amazingly comfortable.  Like none other.  The regular beds were a bit soft, but that's preference not a lack of quality. Now the not so great.  We are rather local so we cook in the room and bring our stuff with us. There is Nowhere to put your kitchen stuff and food. The beautiful but poorly functioning cupboards are few and filled with dishes,  etc. The dishwasher in 822 is loud and cheap. As well as the laundry machines, tho the laundry served it's purpose. We were told the coffee maker took 'individual pods,  like keurig',  so we brought a supply.  Nope.  It take coffee packs or ground like a regular drip pot. No worries, we just prepared for something different. Promotions for pink jeep tours.  You should not forego the Jeep tours,  they are great.  But,  just remember that in order to get those huge discounts you will have to attend a 90 min presentation on purchasing Hyatt timeshare. I wouldn't say it was high pressure,  but when we said no several times to the sales person, the manager was brought out,  then when that didn't work  the 'quality control'  person came out with more pitch. The 800 building at least does not have access to the walkway, you have to go out to the parking lot to get to it. Not a big issue. Oh and what's with the pergolas,  ok they are pretty,  but no shelter from sun and it would have been nice to sit and watch the thunder storms over the rock formations. Anyway,  would we stay again... Yes. We had a great time and with a few bugs that would only bother a small fraction of us, it was still good.Stayed here on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The place is nice. But for a resort, it is not. You would think there would be room service, but no. Nothing opened and i didnt expect things to be open on Christmas in this so called resort which is actually a time share, but they still charged the 25.00 daily resort fee which there where no extra accommodations. No, I won't stay here again. The Best Western up the street was nicer.Great location, pretty rooms, gorgeous views from the pool (and some rooms). I have stayed here twice and always get the full 2 bedroom unit as a time share exchange. This set up created a fairly quiet and private stay. The parking is a bit limited and you will have to climb stairs. If that's a problem, this not the place for you. The mid week house keeping was nice and very thorough. Many time share resorts are moving away from providing this. There is a shopping area attached to the resort with a Starbucks and a few restaurants and shops. The wildflower bread company is nice to have so close. You can order carry out and walkover to pick up. Lots of great and healthy soups, salads and sandwiches. Seems many reviewers are expecting a full service resort. This is a time share which is sort of like owning the place except you have extra amenities. That said, they are not staffed for full service.Well done, Hyatt. Excellent guest service team (Victoria at the front desk was delightful) and outstanding accommodations. We stayed in the 1 bedroom suite and extended from 2 nights to 3 as the property, pools, views and Sedona experience exceeded expectations. Funny to read other Yelpers views and then have a completely different experience. Is it dark at night on the property? Yes and this is why you get flashlights at check in and appreciate the fact that you don't feel like you are on the Vegas strip. Is it impossible to navigate around because you don't have bright street lights? Of course not. Some have made comments on the dark color interiors. The unit we are in has at least 4 windows and 2 glass patios. We are on the second floor which may help, but again, trying to figure out what people are hoping for and how much time they are spending in a condo vs being outside at the pool, on hikes etc. The decor is a lodge feel - so greens, Browns, oranges, copper is the look. Goes well with the rock fireplace in he living room. Anyway, I highly recommend this for people who are looking for a comfortable, upscale, well appointed condo with an amazing swimming pool, recreation area (ping pong, pool table) and walking distance to uptown Sedona. Splurge on the 1 bedroom vs the Studio if you can.Stayed here over the holidays and was looking forward to relaxing in beautiful Sedona.  I was able to enjoy the beautiful scenery Sedona has to offer, but relaxation definitely did not occur.  We stayed in a studio which was great at first, but when the family checked in to the room next to us, all relaxation went out the window.  All studios are connected to other rooms and there is no sound barrier between the rooms.  You can hear everything!  Every dish being washed, conversation that is happening, door being shut, etc.  We immediately went to the front desk and complained and the front desk was apologetic and stated they would call the room and advise about the noise.  Not sure if they actually called as nothing changed throughout our two night stay.  I woke up this morning at 4:00 am to them talking and again doing laundry.  I'm convinced they were running their dry cleaning business out of the room.  How can someone need to do laundry non-stop for two days??The grounds are nice, but expect to walk a lot of stairs to get around.  For the $$$ you pay I would advise to stay somewhere else in this beautiful town.We only stayed here two nights, but it's worth mentioning that there was nothing to complain about this property, everything was just right.  Check-in was easy and the concierge was there to offer us maps and information about restaurants.  Our studio room was clean and seemed very new, the bathroom was WOW really nice.  There are areas to grill and seating with fire pits and lovely views of the landscape.  We were missing a corkscrew and called the front desk and someone was there in less than five minutes to deliver it.  I believe it is a timeshare property, but we weren't given a sales pitch at all (relief!).  It seemed like many guests stay for a whole week and do grocery shopping and may not receive maid service everyday.The ONLY possible complaint someone might have is that there are A LOT of stairs.  From our room to the front desk you had to walk up, down, up again and then down a short hill.  I liked the walking but it might be an issue for some people.  The location is really great too, we just walked to dinner in the downtown area.I will stay there again and highly recommend to friends and family.We've stayed at the Hyatt on two different trips to Sedona.  Advantage: great location and we can utilize Hyatt points.  Our studio was very compact; the bathroom was nearly as large as the living quarters. It was a splendid bathroom, by the way.  The unit was very dark with inadequate lighting.  The resort has close  access to shops, a great coffee/breakfast place and an easy walk to many attractions. The resort also has fire pits, hot tubs in a beautiful setting.Not really a great resort in a really gorgeous place. For starters, it's a ""residence club"" not a ""real Hyatt,"" which the employees liked to point out at every juncture: ""sorry, but remember, we're not a Regency."" Pathetic. I stay in a lot of Hyatts--I'm a Diamond member--and yes, they differ slightly, and yes, I understand why this place is different. But, all the same, the service was lackluster and unapologetic. The pool area was okay--the view was splendid. But the units were cramped and the place seemed more like a family/retirement center than a real resort. Maybe that's the ""we're not a Regency part."" What's more, even after my boyfriend and I checked in, the hotel reception called and left us the following message: ""Mr. and Mrs. K----, I hope all is well...."". I guess they didn't take a very good look at us, after all. Better luck next time--elsewhere.We got locked out of our room at least 6 times. Had to stand outside the room in freezing cold after the hot tub. No one was manning the pool towel stand. Had to go to front desk to get towels. Washing machine in room started flooding. Waited for it to be fixed. The guy left &amp; the machine did not work. Had to call again. My daughter left her new necklace on the fire place mantel. I called the next day. I was told I would get a call back. I had to call everyday for 3 days to be told that no one found it. It was right there on the mantel. So housekeeping must of kept it. This trip was a complete waste of A LOT of money","Wanted to spend a bit extra on Sedona so reserved a room at Hyatt, but my stay at Holiday Inn was better than this place. Don't expect your room to be ready until at least 5pm. Their idea of a ""room with a view"" is one with a parking lot and a tree. Doesn't matter if you book months in advance and specifically ask for a nice view.. that's what you're going to get. Unfriendly staff who expect guests to know where everything is. Don't give any directional information. Guests have to buy all food and find dining accommodations on their own. No complimentary ANYTHING. Outlets were few and most of them weren't working. Flashlight was broken so asked for a new one.. which was broken also, so we ended up just using my iphone. Don't waste your time and more importantly your money on this place. You'll be much better off going with a local property.I came here a second  time with my friend and we had a great time. The best times to come are during winter and fall months to avoid the overcrowding. This place has so many features and great scenery.Very nice location and convenient to many of the attractions in and around Sedona.  If you're looking for a ""hotel"" experience you're not going to get it here.  It's a residence club and with the exception of housekeeping, you're pretty much on your own.  I had reserved a studio which was more than enough room for me.  There was a living area with a small kitchen (no stove), a sleeping area (king sized bed), a large bathroom, and a nice deck to relax on.  I was in an upper unit so sitting out on the deck was nice, but if you get a lower unit you may feel like you're in a dungeon (just sayin').  The room did appear to be a little worn (i.e. the dust ruffle around the bed was torn in a few spots), but it was clean and the kitchen had more than enough supplies.When I arrived to my unit the cleaning people had forgotten to pick up the garbage they left outside my doorway which was a bit of a drag, but mistakes happen.  For the most part I'd say it was relatively quiet, but the people in the adjoining unit were rather loud each and every time they went out of their room.  It seemed like my whole room shook each time they shut their front door.  At least I couldn't hear their TV or them talking while they were in their unit.  While it seemed like every parking spot was taken all around the property, I can honestly say you wouldn't know anyone else was staying in the other condos (with the exception of my door slamming neighbors).  The pool area/hot tubs were nice, but the weather that weekend was a little on the chilly side and windy so there weren't many people around there either.  I did partake in the hot tub one day at sunset and it was super relaxing, not to mention the surroundings were too shabby either.I enjoyed my stay, but I'm just not sure the $208/night fee was worth it to me.  I sort of prefer a bit more of a hotel experience in terms of having an onsite bar/restaurant and seeing other hotel guests.In a wonderful location, quality rooms with good views and great landscaping. Remember this is a Hyatt hotel in prime real estate, you will be shelling out some cash for a room. Book in advance. It is also in walking distance of a Starbucks as well as a few restaurants. One thing to take into account is Sedona is also on peak season cause of the weather. Prices are always up up up.We really enjoyed our stay.  Although our room was small, as it was a studio (room 2110), it had all the amenities.  The resort was very nice and right outside of our room we had a fire pit and bbq grills.  The pool has an amazing view, but it is quite a walk from where our room was.  We did go to the sales presentation, and were hassled somewhat, but just keep saying no.  The rate on the hotel is great if you do the pink jeep tour.Property is beautiful. Our 1 bedroom condo seemed very new, spacious with all amenities. Centrally located with a nice restaurant and a couple small eateries close by. Check in was like someone was reading a script. The desk agent wasn't very personable. She gave directions to the rom and the layout of the place is rather confusing. Checked in at 2pm room wasn't ready until after 4.  The place is also a timeshare so be prepared to be jumped on once checked in. Bellhop was great. Went and got ice for us. Nice fireplace and jacuzzi tub. Had to call maintenance to have them reset the tub so It would work. Pool is decent and of course closes at 10pm. Lame! Check out at 10am sucks! Called to get more towels in the morning and they never came! Overall nice place pretty spendy with check in and out times very inconvenient.  I don't know. May be another place as good and cheaper.I don't understand all the wonderful reviews. Are they staying in a different Hyatt? Pros: Scenery (you get that every where here) Workout facilityCons: Check-in: took about 30 min. They make you go pick up a welcome packet from the concierge. It's not optional. Of course you have to wait for the concierge to finish with the other guests and when you finally get the ""packet"" it is just a list of restaurants and a single coupon. Finding the room: IMPOSSIBLE! My room was literally hidden on the back side of the building below ground level. I looked for another 30 minutes just to find it. Privacy: forget about it. There is a solid 1"" gap under my door. I put the couch pillow up against it. Plus you can hear every word your neighbors say. Cramped: about half the size of a standard hotel roomCoffee maker: never figured out how to use it. Pool: had a layer of dirt in the bottom of itFire pit: just a pit, no fireCable: confusing. Why does channel 33 have 145 options (ie 33-1,33-2) but only 143 and 145 are in use? And no ABC, CBS, or NBC? Bed: not good, bring your own pillows. Parking: difficult. They share a lot with a bunch of over priced shops that are very busy. So forget about parking any where near your room. And no electrical outlets near the bed?! Why can't hotels figure out we charge our phones near the bed so we can use our alarm rather than the unreliable wake up call or the less reliable hotel alarm clock. Over all, this is a Super 8 disguised as a resort.Thank you to Christine and Matthew at the front desk!!  We came in for our honeymoon and were exhausted after the big weekend wedding.  Christine gave us a room, way before check in time, so we could take a nap!  After we awoke she upgraded us to a new beautiful room, as requested by my new husband.  We were rested and then treated to a great room with a kitchen, family room, fire place, jacuzzi tub and lovely separate bathroom.  One of the best things was that the room had a washer and dryer!  We washed a lot of clothes... hiking in red rock proves to be dirty!!  We even went home with suitcases full of clean clothes!!In addition, we went to the store and stocked the kitchen... tired of all the meals on the road.  We had such a lovely time; we sat on the balcony, went to the pool and hot tub, sat by the fire and just relaxed.  During the days we explored the Grand Canyon and beautiful red rock trails of Sedona.  I recommend the Hyatt at Pinon Pointe.  The hotel and staff are wonderful.  Thank you to all of you at the front desk that made our honeymoon so special!  Matthew even found our misplaced ball cap!Outstanding. Have been here several times in last 4 years. We are owners here &amp; at @ 2 other sites in their resident properties. We originally had reserved a studio (one room-limited space) but asked to upgrade to a one bedroom. The gal (Christine) worked very hard to find a one bedroom unit &amp; put us in an excellent unit with fantastic view &amp; great location. This is what we have come to expect since becoming members of Hyatt Resident club. This property is ideally located &amp; the staff is very accommodating. The facilities (ie exercise room, pool etc) are as good or better than most resorts. All in all a very great place to stay in a beautiful town.Very convenient location with beautiful scenery. But the soundproofing between units are poor. Guests upstairs were unbelievably noisy with their thunder-like stomping. Also, the staff (who we always said ""Good morning"" every day) at the front desk still didn't remember us by asking ""Are you staying here?"". I would have given 4 stars if we didn't experience these factors. 5 stars for the location tho.This place is nice, clean, reasonably priced, and has an amazing view.  I was able to take better pictures off my balcony then almost any other place in town.  It was very convenient to walk across the parking lot to get a snack, drink, or a coffee.  I never had an issue parking near my room.  The property is also adjacent to downtown shopping area.  I will be back the next time I am in town.Excellent location in the heart of Sedona.  Ample parking with plenty of places to eat within walking distance.Staff is friendly and efficient.  Sales pitch isn't abrasive.  Pool area is well maintained and ultra family-friendly.  Rooms are private, spacious and well-stocked.  We really enjoyed the view from our studio balcony.Okay - cut to the facts.  My wife and I are owners of several Hyatt timeshare properties and are big fans of Hyatt.  They have quality, boutique type resorts in various parts of the country.  Sedona is a fine property with all of the amenities required to make for a very comfortable and enjoyable stay.  Some say the studio is cramped - well look at the website, understand the size and maybe you have should reserved a 1 bedroom unit instead.  The units are studio and one-bedroom, and when combined they equal a very spacious 2 bedroom unit.  The staff is professional and as for having to wait at check-in - get over it, you wait in line at Starbucks and don't complain.  Couldn't figure out the coffee maker - come on, maybe you shouldn't work with electrical appliances - instructions are on the counter next to the coffee maker.  Looking at a parking lot - well the very high mountains behind the lot are the attraction and are clearly visible.  Maybe you should have opted for a higher level of room.  The TV has a lot of channels including all major networks, and a simple instruction sheet is on the TV.  Some people just want to complain and have no interest in being happy, and nothing seems to meet their self perceived worth.  Sedona Hyatt is a gem and the nicest place in town.  The only admonition we have is that the Timeshare sales staff seems to be overly arrogant, rude, and demanding - avoid them at all costs.It was a great hotel. The rooms are awesome. There are full kitchens in the condos and they had everything we needed. Jacuzzi tubs, huge showers, fire place and beautiful patios. The pool area was awesome. It was chili in Sedona but the pools were 85degrees and the jacuzzi's were hot. The pool overlooks the mountains. My 4 year old had a blast. The only bummer was there wasn't a great restaurant onsite. The restaurants in the shops were average. Definitely a great resort and close to everything in Sedona. It wasn't cheap but since it had a kitchen we  cooked some meals and it was well worth it.We came into down early June for a family wedding. The hotel is clean, modern and well maintained.  We initially went with the studio but upgraded to a 1 bedroom with the pink jeep tour.  So glad we went with the bigger room.  Most of the studio's appear to be inner units that look out on stairway.  One &amp; two bedroom have decks/patios and frankly are just more open &amp; airy.   The unit is well appointed - full kitchen, huge tub &amp; shower, ceiling fan over the bed etc etc  With the pink jeep package, they pick you up and drop you off near the lobby which is really convenient! ( and the tour was fun)    Be aware this hotel/time share is big so some units are a drive from the lobby and some, like ours, have many steps down to the unit (it's built on a hillside).  I think our room was in the 1900 building and we had to walk down about 30 steps - it wasn't a big deal really but if we were disabled or it was super hot it could have been an issue so be aware.  Also, having read other reviews I was ready for the sales pitch which we kindly declined with not issue. Site is close to town, they have a few restaurants on site but we didn't try them because the breakfast place didn't open until 7am and we are super early risers.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Really nice spot!After a grueling trip over 3 days from SF Bay to Grand Canyon to Flagstaff to Monument Valley, this place appeared as a paradise and a savior to our complete exhaustion. It also consolidated my belief that Hyatt is probably the greatest hotel franchise in the US.From the very beginning - our check-in - I could see why the brand name Hyatt carried prestige. The front desk was extremely welcoming, friendly &amp; helpful, giving us a plethora of useful information about the hotel &amp; its features. The concierge provided us with info on the city of Sedona itself, such as its energy vortexes and jeep rides. While our family did not partake in these activities, the concierge desk's willingness to make our stay in Sedona enjoyable was much appreciated.Now, onto the rooms. This is not really a ""hotel,"" but as its tagline ""Vacation Club"" suggests, more like studios/condos. Which is great, because as it is not connected to other rooms, you get quietness and privacy - something many from busy urban hubbubs would appreciate. Inside the rooms lies luxury and comfort, mingled together. The humongous bathroom with the marbled shower; a large kitchen area to prepare all kinds of food (there's a Safeway nearby!); deliciously comfortable living room with a huge TV &amp; nice fireplace; a pull-out sofa bed that you can actually sleep comfortably on; the master bedroom with a JACUZZI! Oh, and most importantly, the beautiful view onto the red rocks encompassing Sedona. Hyatt Pinon Pointe is the perfect escape from your mundane everyday life. Stay here for a few days, and enjoy hiking, golfing, helicopter tours, etc. Sedona is truly a gem in the state of Arizona, and I owe it to this five-star hotel for making our stay so wonderful.VERDICT: For $200 per night, this place is a STEAL!The Hyatt Pinon Pointe is situation as its name implies - on a high hill in the middle of Sedona. It really has some awesome views, in every direction. And even though it's in the middle of Sedona, it doesn't feel like it. Anywhere you look, there are plenty of mountains and colorful skies upon which to feast your eyes.We were given a warm welcome at reception, and they took a few minutes to ask about our interests and what we wanted to do while in Sedona (much appreciated) and based on our feedback they gave some wonderful recommendations for places to explore, such as Red Rock state park. Very cool.Decor - inside and out - is excellent. Very tasteful American southwestern. We stayed in a studio room, which was perfect since we were only there for a few nights and were going to spend most of our time outside. A nice big comfortable bed, loveseat, flat-screen TV, plus a decent-sized kitchenette with flatware and dishes. The bathroom came stocked with a good array of toiletries, as you'd expect out of a resort - including toothpaste.The balcony offered a great place to start the morning (and we were up early, since we were still functioning on Eastern Time). I looked forward to a quiet hour spent reading on the balcony each morning, before starting our day.Parking was OK - though there were only a few spaces right outside our unit, and we generally drove another 30 feet / 10 meters in order to park in the less-crowded parking lots at the higher end of the facility (away from the reception area). Wherever I go, I prefer not to park right in front where everyone is competing for the closest parking spot, anyway, so it was all good to me.The pool area is fantastic. It's situated on a high point, so that you have a view of all of the mountains around. It felt kind of like being on Mount Olympus. There was also a nice big grill for guests to use, a lounge, and a charming fire pit. Awesome.Due to the low light ordinance in Sedona, they provide flashlights for your use. Very thoughtful of them, and I saw several guests making use of them. However, as I'm used to skulking about in the dark, I didn't use a flashlight and got around just fine.Very nice place - and I would definitely stay here again when in Sedona.This Resort has awesome views and the pool and jacuzzi area has gorgeous views of the Mountains and the Red rocks. We stayed in 2 bed suite and was upstairs with amazing view!  The master bedroom had amazing bed with a sunken bath tub..There are restaurants and shops right next door as well !!The Good... The views, clean room...The bad, poor Wifi if you need it, which was the reason I decided to stay here.  I had to do some work and upon checking in for one night, o was specific in asking about the wifi.  I was assured there was, and the front desk also boosted the work out room they had, and the best views in Sedona.  I had to change rooms to get working wifi, and it was not reliable.  I was offered another room change again ( for the third time) but it was 11 pm and I was done.  There is no easy way to move your luggage to and from your car, or another room.  It's very dark at night and lots of stairs.  I did check out the work out room in the morning, and went to get water from the cooler, it was empty.... Seriously?  With the name like Hyatt I would have expected the amenities to be well maintained.  Especially in the desert, you should not be empty on water.This is a time share resort, so it does not have the look and feel of a hotel, but more of apartment or studio style.My first time at a Hyatt time share and I'm really impressed. The brown adobe hut looking buildings didnt look like much but inside it's more like a great 1 bedroom apartment than a hotel room. Furniture's all dark wood, new looking brand name appliances, and it really is a fully equipped kitchen including blender and dish towels. Oh and there's a washer/dryer and the biggest bath tub I've ever seen. Price is pretty steep but its an expensive little town on a holiday weekend so its to be expected. This actually makes me want to check out their properties in other cities.","Great place to stay in Sedona. Can't beat the view and the pool is awesome. Clean rooms and great staff.Nice location and very nice views  Property well maintained but very large and spread out. From our room to the pool was a 10 minute walk - mostly uphill it seemed. Hotel staff was friendly. I thought it was nice but for a couple I think there would be a couple of places in town that seem a bit more cozy but still elegant. The Sedona strip is right next to the hotel and the upscale mall next to the Hyatt is very nice and convenient.Very impressed !! Nice experience !!! Studio Rooms were very spacious and clean. Great View from the room's patio. Rooms have a small kitchenette with microwave and fridge. Bathroom had double sinks and very spa like. We had one sink that was slow draining and they came and took care of it right away. Staff very friendly. Pool and Hot tub area very nice. Landscape around the pool area was extremely nice and relaxing. Shops and Restaurants in walking distance. Very Pleased !!!Ok, there are definitely some things that one can complain about, but not me. Why? In-room hot tub. As I lay back in it, I said, everything is forgiven. And it was. So what...irked me temporarily? Lack of parking. Excess stairs. Views which are somewhat dubious (yes, you can see red rocks, but past the other blocks). It's really hard to know what you're getting without having been there first. I saw some hotels which really had much better views, but I HAD THE HOT TUB. And a lot of space. and two sinks. and a balcony. which is what I really wanted.I just love Sedona.  It is like a city within a national park.  This was my third visit. This hotel/condo is in prime location - right at the ""Y"" and yet, on an elevation so it feels a little remote also.  The entrance is pretty and the rooms/suites are nice and comfy enough.  The bathrooms are upgraded nicely.  It is not a 5 star place but still nice for families.  There is a small pool and an activity center, which has a small work out room, well stocked with towels and water.  The jacuzzi and the BBQ area were nice but small, already taken by what appears to be a small party of extended family with small children.  At my last visit, we stayed at the Arroyo Roble, which is creek side and we had a room with a fireplace which made it special.  The Hyatt was ok but I probably will stay at the Arroyo Roble next time.Very nice, very clean. Great facility, great views. Has a great little pool for small children. Also the connected shops, especially the Starbucks are very convenient. Very close to ""Old Town Sedona""Super friendly staff, helped out when i had to change my stay dates upon arriving. Helping with tour guides etc. Rooms were small but had the basic stuff and were clean - great location.Beautiful views, excellent customer service and concierge/welcome package, gorgeous room, spacious kitchen for us to cook most of our meals in, gigantic jet tub, big patio, simple parking lot, centrally located, tons of inclusive accommodations- guest speakers, movies, work out center etc... We may consider going with a Hyatt timeshare when we retire.Love this place, I didn't even want to leave my room. Place is amazing with it's great view from the porch, the fireplace,(oh how I love fireplaces), granite countered kitchen, the jacuzzi bathtub! The staff was so helpful and friendly. If you have ever stayed at a timeshare, you know what I'm talking about. What a steal at $180 a night, considering there was a pull out couch which is perfect to accommodate additional people. Our friends stayed somewhere else, so we had this place all to ourselves, which was fine in my book.  Remember this is a timeshare, so of course they tell you about this meeting they have with their tenants. They tell you, ""If you go you get $160 credit back towards your room, with no purchase obligation"". We didn't do it, so I advise you do the same, it's a timeshare so their goal is to sell you it. If you have ever encountered timeshare sales people, they are worse than car salesman. As long as you don't attend that, you will have a beautiful experience.Our family of four stayed here and loved it. Full kitchen, fire place, washer and dryer in the unit, beautiful furnishings, lovely patio,, amazing service, especially for a timeshare. We grilled out near the fire pit, looking at the sunset over the mountains. It was magical. The only bad part was only getting to stay one night. We can't wait to go back.Our group of 4 families rented 4 one bedroom units. Each of the unit  was  beautifully furnished, clean, nice kitchen, roomy, washer/dryer provided. All  with great views. One unit assigned to us had an old looking bathroom, with no jacuzzi tub. They granted our request to move to a better one the next day.We checked in very late, the pathways to the units were confusing in the dark, and the direction the front desk gave us was wrong. That particular receptionist didn't seem very welcoming, we got the feeling she can't wait for us to leave her alone. We had requested to keep our units as close to each other as possible awhile back, but to no avail.There are units with several steps to climb, no elevator.Our kids enjoyed the pool and hot tub, with plenty of time to swim after hiking, it was nice that  they keep it open till late not like some hotel pools that closed at 6/7pm.The view is unbelievable from our room and balcony. All of us fell in love with Sedona. Definitely recommends the city and the Hyatt for families.The location of the hotel is in the middle of the city, high on a hill. Very convenient to everything. Considering everything, the hotel is great value for the money. We'd love to go back.I stayed here with my parents, who own a timeshare, hence we were spared the sales pitch. The thing I really liked was actually being right in the middle of town and even within WALKING distance of stuff. That seems almost unheard of for any hotel in Arizona, much less a nice, refuge-like place like this. You can walk around Uptown Sedona for an hour or two, then retreat to the pool deck and watch the moon rise over the red rocks.So if I were here on my own and had to endure that sales pitch....yep, still worth it.Became a Timeshare owner here a few years ago. Have stayed at the resort many times. The staff are professional and courteous. The units are first-class and clean. Love the jetted tub! Full kitchen, gas fireplace, and private patios with awesome views of the red rocks. Probably the main reason we opted for this resort is the proximity to Uptown Sedona. We can park the car and walk to many shops, and take the free trolley to many more. The traffic in Sedona can get terrible at times. Heated pool and hot tub. Gas fire pit by the pool.Good location, but average. There are no Dining facilities at the hotel. Staff recommends a restaurant across the driveway, but it does not open until 5pm. There is a Starbucks there , which Has outdoor seating with great views of the red rocks.Stayed in a one bedroom with a fireplace. It was a little seedy for my taste but my boyfriend loved it. Unfortunately, the pools were closed for renovation.  I would go back if going to Sedona b/c of the location. There are lots of shops and activities close by. The hotel has free parking for guests.Gorgeous views and beautiful suites!Fabulous hotel! Staff was extremely helpful and kind, room was perfect size, very clean and well stocked, and the location and view was awesome. The whirlpools by the firepit on a cool night under the stars was incrediblt after climbing the red rocks all day. Very nicely located near everything in Sedona. Will definitely stay there again when we return.I love it here, my favorite place to go and i go every fall. The Hyatt has the best view, close to walking around the town,pool is so relaxing. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and even have washer dryers.Stayed here 1/13/12 to 1/16/12. The 1 bedroom rooms are great. They have a full kitchen with mini washer &amp; dryers in the unit.My young family and I enjoyed a wonderful experience at the Hyatt over a six night stay.  Our 2 bedroom unit was clean, well stocked, and had a 270 degree view of Sedona's red rocks.  The staff was professional and courteous.  The pool was near-by, loaded with plenty of chairs and tables for sun or shade, and the 1.5 foot kiddie pool proved to be a winner with my young child.  The BBQ's were available nightly and cleaned daily.  I would highly recommend to my friends and family.","are you thinking of investing in a timeshare?  are you dying for someone to take you on a tour of their not-quite-yet-finished condos?  do you want a free helicopter tour of ""old sedona""?  then you have come to the right place!  the hyatt pinon pointe has it all:  clean and comfortable accomodations, beautiful views, access to shopping, dining and activities, and a PUSHY, PUSHY staff that will STALK YOU until you agree to go on their 90-minute tour of their almost-but-not-quite-finished condos in exchange for a free helicoptor tour of old sedona.the bf and i hid out in our room, planning our comings-and-goings around the concierge's lunch schedule, dodging voicemails, and avoiding eye contact with the staff in order to get through our 2 night stay without having to endure a sales pitch.  we live in san francisco for chrissakes...like we can afford more property!that aside, this seemed to be the nicest hotel in sedona (besides the enchantment) and for $119/night, we got a nice little studio with refrigerator, dishes, microwave, TV, couch, etc.  it is also centrally located near lots of food, shops and grocery stores.  i would definitely be back...but not until their timeshares are filled.",,"['pool', 'spa', 'areas', 'well', 'kept', 'beautiful', 'views', 'red', 'rocks', 'gym', 'activity', 'center', 'nicely', 'stocked',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-plus-inn-of-sedona-sedona-2,Best Western Plus Inn Of Sedona,4.0,$$,72,"This place gets 5 stars because of Saara and her superb customer service. Excellent stay all due to her kindness and her helpfulness. This place also has some killer views at sunset and a pretty decent jacuzzi. The lobby feels like a lodge in winter time, with its cozy fireplace and warm cider. The rooms are basic, but you aren't in Sedona to stare at four walls, are you?You are surrounded by beautiful vistas everywhere you turn at this property.  Sedona is gorgeous.  The staff here is top-notch and couldn't have done enough for us.  From booking an off-road jeep tour to driving us into town for dinners and then picking us up with their free shuttle, everyone that we met was truly service oriented.Clap! Clap! Clap!Thank you Best Western Plus Inn of Sedona--you are a great team.Breakfast each morning offers many, many choices.  There is something there for everyone.It was an extremely generous breakfast to offer their guests.We had a comfortable king size bed with a fireplace.I noticed that this business is also pet friendly.Just came back after a 6 night stay. I'm always a bit nervous to commit to that many nights at a place I've never stayed before but we were really pleased with our choice. Initially booked through Expedia but later called the hotel directly to reconfirm room type and got upgraded to a third floor King with fireplace (and if you are coming in anytime from now on, you'll appreciate that!). The location was easy to find, minutes into Uptown Sedona, fantastic hiking ""in your backyard"", Airport Mesa for more views, shopping at Whole Foods or Bashas. We were glad we weren't right in Uptown as it was really busy even for mid-November. Room faced west so perfect for sunsets. Very clean. Comfy bed. Nice touches included a Keurig and  dispensers for all toiletries like shampoo and updated bathroom and room colours. Parking was right in front of the door. Check-in was super fast and friendly with a good recommendation for dinner (Judi's, just about a 2 minute walk down the hill). Wifi was great. Complimentary breakfast was varied and hosted by 2 really nice young women who kept up with refreshing everything. We made breakfast sandwiches and yogurt parfaits, toasted bagels  and more. Pop and ice machines are in a stand alone feature which eliminated the usual ""down the hall"" rattle. We took the hotel shuttle on a whim one night but found the location made it just as easy to drive into town on our own. Weather didn't permit as much pool time as we'd hoped for but did manage one afternoon - the pool area was really clean, had brand new lounger furniture and towels were in a big cabinet poolside. Pool is heated but not overly so - would be a bit of a stretch for swimming in the winter.We wish for two things - 1. How about going no smoking? Since all the terraces are shared, it would be so much better not to have to move inside when the neighbours lit up. 2. Recycling bins in rooms so that we could recycle whatever the hotel does - bottles, paper? We're used to separating stuff and the hotel seems committed to a number of Green initiatives.I'm a Best Western Diamond member and this is one of my favorite hotels, based on the views alone! Simply breathtaking! We stayed here 5 nights for our first trip to Sedona and could not be happier with this hotel. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable.The breakfast had a lot of variety and was included in our stay. The pool area was very clean and refreshing after a hike. We used the shuttle service and it was convenient. I suggest to travelers to make sure you call ahead so you don't have to wait as long. We had to wait 25 minutes one time as we didn't plan ahead. The best part is the view of the red rocks. We sat on the terrace daily and enjoyed sunrise, sunset and stars! Simply amazing!***** For the Staff and Location*For the room itselfI'm one of the Best Western Rewards member but not sure what that means any more. The front desk staff and manager were most helpful and able to handle our issues. They were understanding and polite.  We were offered a room on the second floor in the building opposite to the registration area.  Checked out the location asked for a room in the main building with the large patio facing east and were granted a different room on the top floor two doors from the office. The breakfast was great, well supplied and staff was also very helpful and friendly. The property is well maintained and you couldn't ask for a more picturesque site.  Didn't use the shuttle service. This is an ideal location since this is in the center of town away from the hustle of the main business area. It's quiet and the views are fantastic. Now for the room: stayed for two nights. Our room had an issue with the sheets and we were just too tired from ripping everything up late at night. Did a further inspection and after some brushing off and further checking, it was decided that the sheets and pillows will be satisfactory for the night. The duvet cover was backwards (open end at the head) but we just tucked everything in and folded the top sheet further down.  For the bed itself, just lying on your back and you're leaning toward the window. The next morning we brought the matter of the bed sheets to the attention of the front desk staff and the manager was present. They were aghast, truly apologetic and would have the room cleaned with new sheets.  Not wanting to make a big fuss, that seemed to rectify the matter.  At least the sheets were clean and the duvet cover is now properly set.  Maybe I can still try to sleep with a slightly tilted mattress in clean sheets. Bottom line: I should have asked for a different room when we first noted the issue with the sheets since this should be a big hint that all was not right with the room since the mattress was rather worn and the air conditioner didn't work properly either.  Can't say that I got a decent nights sleep in two days. I've stayed at many BW's before and this is the first major room issue. This is an unusual isolated situation limited to what was encountered in that room and not a reflection on the entire property, however I just read that another patron had a similar issue with the air conditioner. Other people may have had great experiences and it was unfortunate that I did not since my experience was disappointing. Would I be back? Not sure and trust that BW's standards here will be reviewed and improved.  To the staff and manager, thank you for trying.We were very impressed!! What a gem. First, the location is great. Central to all the Sedona action. The views from the shared balcony are nothing short of spectacular!!There was hot apple cider in the Libby when we checked in. What a nice treat! They also gave us a welcome bag with 2 bottles of water and 2 granola bars.  A very thoughtful touch. Our room had a fireplace which was great. The bed was super comfy and the water pressure in the shower was excellent! We had everything we needed. No complaints. Breakfast included in the morning with all sorts of options including bagels, toast, cranberry nut bread, eggs, sausage, potatoes, cereal, fruit you get etc. They have a nifty pancake machine with a conveyor belt. My little one loved watching it.  We would stay here again anytime we return to Sedona. Would be awesome to have a snack and a glass of wine on the balcony. Was too cold during our stay. Next time!! Same case with the pool and jacuzzi. Looked nice but brrrr! A great choice for a reasonable price. Parking was a breeze with a spot right outside our door too.The views are spectacular from the terraces, and most of the rooms.  This was our second visit after being here 15 years ago, so this hotel had lost a bit of it's new hotel looks, but the views always make it a great hotel!  The complimentary buffet breakfast is a big plus.  Take advantage of the complimentary shuttle driven by Jamie, who will keep you entertained as he drives you to local restaurants (have a few margaritas because you aren't driving!). We loved Elote restaurant!!This was are first visit to Sedona and we enjoyed our stay at this Best Western Inn at Sedona. There are views from all sides of the Canyon at this hotel. We had a west view and were delighted. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We had a problem with our A/C and called the front desk to report the problem. An employee came to repair the issue quickly and curiously. The breakfast was diverse and plentiful.  The front desk arranged a Pink Jeep Canyon Tour which was wonderful.The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. We can't wait to come back and stay again.This wasn't my first pick in hotels but I ended up being happy with it. It was more than what I wanted to spend (I stayed at the Sedona Motel the first time I was in Sedona) but it is a very nice place. The room was very clean, and looked modern. The views from the patio were insaaane! I feel like you get great views regardless of where you are placed within the property. There is a real breakfast-buffet style, with eggs, sausage, and pancakes. The fitness room had three machines, and a rack of dumbbells going up to 30# I believe. I took advantage of the shuttle, as it is very convenient and free (tipping not included). It was nice to drink at dinner and not have to worry about driving. Very nice hotel option for Sedona!While planning our stay in Sedona, there were two Best Westerns availabe - the one that was in downtown Sedona, and this one, just a few minutes drive outside the downtown stretch. We chose this one because it was a bit cheaper, and boy, are we glad we did.The back door of the room opened out onto a public balcony, and the view from here was absolutely breathtaking. I woke up before the rest of the sleepyheads and spent some time on the balcony early in the morning and couldn't believe my eyes. The included-breakfast was very well stocked. And get this - they had an automatic pancake machine! You press a button, and a conveyor belt starts rolling, and a minute later, a fresh-cooked pancake plops out. That made my day.The gym was a little bit small, but seriously - who goes on vacation to work out? Work out in your bed! Let the excellent views inspire you.Like others said, awesome views you can see from the extensive terraces. Surprisingly quiet. Those things were a big plus for me--I was visiting Sedona to de-stress.Pretty fountain outside and fireplace in the lobby. They have a concierge.The rooms are comfortable and nice, not luxury, but they don't claim to be a 5-star fancy hotel or anything. Granite countertop in the bathroom and updated furniture. Clean. Coffee maker in the room, cable, etc.Staff in the lobby was pleasant and helpful.Full breakfast was served buffet style--standard stuff--eggs, cereal, toast, etc.4 stars only because they don't have a bar or restaurant on site. It would be nearly perfect if they did. They did have a shuttle that we didn't have the chance to use, so that kind of counterbalances the lack of a restaurant/bar.They have a pool and hot tub, which we didn't try because the weather was pretty chilly. Looked clean and nice.I love the views from this hotel.  It was quiet and clean and the beds were comfortable.  The breakfast was just okay.Best secret in town :-) great location. Great views from terrace... The upgrade way worth it.  Little traffic..compared to the crazy traffic close by. Joan at the concierge was brilliant.. hidden trails.. thank you best westernI just got home from a weekend with friends in Sedona. My two friends, along with me and my dog, checked into our room on Friday, January 31, 2015. Things started off great with a warm and welcoming front desk staff.They were very accommodating with us humans and extremely sweet with my shy pup. They have Milk Bone dog biscuits at the front desk and hot apple cider for their two-legged guests near the fireplace. Our room was wonderful, with the most amazing view! I don't think there's a bad view to be had here. It was also super-clean and the beds were very comfortable. Just across the street from the hotel is a sweet little park for early morning walks and there are a couple of great trails within walking distance. The free breakfast was great and we were able to enjoy it on the heated, dog-friendly patio. I don't believe I would have enjoyed my Sedona vacation half as much if we'd stayed anywhere else!Our second visit to this Inn and it was another great visit! Many thanks to Hope at the front desk who upgraded us and put us in a 300 block room early in the day: we arrived from the Grand Canyon around 11:30 in the morning and the Inn's shuttle took us to uptown Sedona for sightseeing while our room was getting ready. We were able to check in early and had a great stay! The only thing I'd caution future guests about is the air conditioning (this one was really noisy for some reason) and to remember to be gracious neighbors to anyone in the unit below you, if you decide to move the extremely heavy patio furniture (apparently it gets pretty windy there in Sedona and they need sturdy chairs!); don't drag those things across the patio because it's right above the people below you.The breakfast is again a key feature of Best Westerns; it's really helpful when the average cost of a family meal during vacations here is around 70$ for 4 people... Also love the fact that Best Westerns always have coffee available in the lobbies.We have stayed in many B&amp;B's and chain hotels in Sedona and the one we continue to return to is the Best Western Plus Inn of Sedona. The property is especially great for groups which we often have 6- 8 friends meeting up. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The rooms are clean and comfortable. I suggest the rooms on the upper level, those with the room numbers 3xx either on the east or west side. East offers great morning sun and west beautiful sun sets. The views of the red rocks are great from either side. The outdoor patios are perfect for a group get together especially under the covered patio area. The pool and hot tubs are great features. The daily newspaper and hot breakfasts are included with your stay. One of the great amenities is the roundtrip complementary shuttle which cannot be beat because it eliminates the task of finding parking at the shops and restaurants. It's definitely worth giving the driver a tip for the convenience of the transportation.We were booked for a 2 night stay at Best Western.  We had a 3 year old, a 9 month old, and 2 dogs.  Initially we were booked a room that was the FARTHEST you could be from the vehicle parking.  Our room was down 2 flights of stairs on a small sidewalk.  Not very accommodating for all the crap we had with us be be back and forth.  Plus my wife had carpal tunnel surgery the previous day, so she wasn't very useful!Upon going to the vehicle and coming back with some more things (almost everything by this point) the phone was ringing.  It was the front desk.  They were calling to ask if everything was as expected.  I explained the room location situation and asked if there were others available.  They were very wiling to show me another room and let us swap.  That's exactly what we did.  The new room was feet from the parking, and NO stairs!  Perfect!  One of the employees saw me struggling with everything going to our initial room and he asked if he could get a cart and help move things to the other room.  This was great!  Thank you random employee!  Think he said he was the shuttle driver.The morning breakfast is great!  Much more than we expected, and much more than a typical hotel breakfast. We were stuffed before we even walked out the door for the day.They were also willing to let us slide our checkout time back to 12pm rather than 11am.  That extra hour with kids and dogs can make a huge difference and helps lower the stress in general.All in all it was a great stay.  Would stay there again no doubt!This property is beautiful and enchanting. Nestled in a hill overlooking cathedral rock, I think? The outside is really really pretty and charming. Our room was facing the parking lot, maybe all the view rooms were full because we got there early evening? Sadly, no view for us. But a short walk to the front of the property did allow for the lovely view. However, I think we should have had a much better room rate given that we had no view. Not quite a good value for the money. The room was clean enough but there were stains on the carpet so that was kind of gross. I have two small dogs so maybe it was a dog room. But my dogs do not pee on carpets so it's pretty disgusting to have a room with stains from other pets. Tile would be a much better option for dog rooms.The breakfast was very good, as was the coffee. And any hotel with staff who make my dad feel comfortable walking around in his muppet character pajamas at 6am is okay with me. We woke at that time and I took my dogs out to relieve themselves after their night in their crate. We walked out to the front with a misty view of the red rocks, it was so glorious! My dad went in the lobby to get some coffee and it started sprinkling. I hurried back to the room and right as I got back it started pouring. So poor papa was either to get drenched or remain in the lobby in pajamas. He did that and apparently someone said we had to do a pink jeep tour. Pops came in an hour later all excited about the jeep tour. Who was this man? My dad is not usually adventurous enough for jeep tours. Before he could change his mind I said absolutely yes! So we did that and it was spectacular. What a fun time!! The hotel staff was very amenable to a slightly later checkout time if we didn't get back from our tour on time. (We stopped on our way to Gallup and only stayed one night). It was nice that their shuttle took us in to town to the jeep tour location. And we called when we were done and the shuttle was there within ten minutes to pick us up. I prefer this hotel location to being right in town. It's more peaceful and it's only a five minute trip by car, if that.So overall, another really good Best Western experience.We stay at the Inn of Sedona for several nights each year when we visit the area.  We've been returning to this property for about 10 years now, because it is quite simply a great experience all around.  They always seem to be making improvements to the hotel and keeping up the quality of the rooms and amenities.  Our only critique was the removal of the fountains near the breakfast area.  They clearly are looking to make room for all the guests at this time, but we'd love to see them somewhere else on the grounds.  Anyhow, the staff are all very friendly and accommodating, the location and views are outstanding, and all at a decent price.  We've thought about staying at other places when we visit, but haven't been impressed enough by the other venues to try them.  Look no further, you won't regret staying here. Can't say enough good things.Myself and our entire wedding party stayed at The Best Western Inn Plus in May. I worked with Jennifer as far as reserving the rooms for everyone. She was fabulous and was able to put us all on the third floor terrace. The view from our rooms far exceeded our expectations. The complimentary hot breakfast each morning was a wonderful added bonus.","The rooms here are comfortable, with all the basic needs for the traveler, including a beautiful view of the Sedona treats! Also, each level has a common patio with tables and chairs for your enjoyment. Sedona is a busy area, so the hotel shuttle comes in very handy, departing every half-hour to all the populars stops. Wonderful views. Great shopping. Go!Great view and great stuff. We only stayed 2 night but we had great time in here.Free breakfast and free shuttle to uptown.I was really expecting to be impressed with this place, but I left feeling kind of sad that we had spent so much money to stay here.Obviously, everywhere in Sedona there are views, and every view in Sedona is gorgeous. The way this inn is built is really interesting, because every level has terraces that go upwards to the main level on the hillside, giving even more interesting views depending on where your room is. Even the lobby is entrancing with great decor and pleasant staff.The first problem we encountered was directly after we got into our room. I was practically suffocating from the heat, even though it was after 10PM. The room was above the temperature reading ability of the thermostat, and, even though the air conditioner was on, there was barely any cool air blowing out. After being on for a minute or two, it would turn off again. Even though it was so late, and we were so tired and ready to pass out, we had to go to the office because the phone was also not working! We received a ""free upgrade"" as compensation to a room near the office.Now, I don't really get why this was an upgrade, because the room seemed smaller, and the bathroom was about half the size of the one we had before. There was a door in the back as well as the front that went out to the shared terrace, but if people pay extra for that, I have no idea why, since you can just walk out there any time. At least the air conditioning and phone worked, but the beds were so incredibly uncomfortable to me that I barely got any sleep whatsoever. The mattresses seem pretty old and dilapidated.All that being said, the parking was still easy to get, the hot breakfast was VERY good, and it was easy to get back to the main road to leave Sedona. I still would avoid staying here again if I visit Sedona any time soon, because that whole experience was definitely not worth the nearly $200 we paid.Very nice place, the views are wondrous. The rooms were clean and very well done. The Staff is friendly and very helpful. One of our party left her purse after a trip on the Pink Jeeps, look for this review. The shuttle driver who was getting off, took her back to town and was able to track the purse down at the Lost and Found. Honest people are visiting here. We at breakfast at the motels buffet. Standard fare but very well down. large selection of fruit, eggs, sausage both pork and turkey, bagels, biscuits and gravey ( gravy was very good and not pasty. We ate here 3 times and the options do change, different eggs and potatoes, all good.Amazing hotel. Picturesque views, very clean and comfortable, high quality rooms, super friendly staff... Can't beat it!Great value for money!!The rooms are smaller than it seems in the pictures. Has the basic amenities. Almost all rooms have a shared common balcony with breathtaking views! You can literally draw the curtain and see the sunrise/sunset from your bed.They offer free hot breakfast - eggs, oatmeal, pancakes, potatoes, meat and coffee and juices. Pretty standard for a best western.The biggest perk is the free shuttle service. You can get pick-up/drop-off service to any restaurant so go ahead and have that extra glass of wine/beer/margarita....This place was great!  A nice surprise for a Best Western and what we paid.  The rooms were very nice (entrances from the outside), a hot breakfast was included, and the view from the balcony behind our room was unbeatable.  That was probably the highlight.  It's a shared/community balcony with the other rooms in your area, but there's tons of room and it's a great place to sit and enjoy the sunset/sunrise.  One star knocked off for the small, somewhat dirty pool.  Otherwise, everything was top notch.  We would definitely return.Of course they are in a nice location.  Great views from the terrace.  It also feels fairly isolated, which is nice.  Like most Best Western Pluses, this place was nice, clean and free breakfast that includes more than just carbs.  I do have to say the coffee was lacking in flavor.  We were able to get the room from points.  It pays to be a member of Best Western!  We never got anything from Hilton and we were members for a few years and stayed with them several times.  They also gave us a bottle of wine.  That was nice.  The rooms are good size.  I did notice the rooms had a hint of old smoke, but only a hint.  I actually liked it because it reminded me of traveling when I was a kid.  The smell was very slight.  My wife didn't even notice the smell.  The beds were very comfy too.  Despite being in the 90's during the day the pool looks like it was closed.  It was green anyway, and not clear either.  We only spent the night so that was not a problem.  My wife stayed at the other Best Western and she says it is a little better and by a creek for a nice walk.  It is also in downtown.Recently stayed here with my daughter and granddaughter for two nights while in Sedona.  This hotel was fantastic.  I would highly recommend it.  The rooms are nice and clean.  Continental breakfast is served each morning from 6:00-10:00.  The views from the terraces are breath taking.  The front lobby staff was extremely helpful and courteous.  There is a shuttle bus that takes you to many nearby places.  The shuttle driver, was extremely knowledgeable about the area.We stayed at the best Western over Thanksgiving 2014 for two nights. The staff was incredibly helpful and went out of their way to make us feel at home. The rooms are clean and well kept. I would definitely return to this one and get an upper room with a beautiful view of the red rocks. My only downside is that the breakfast was heralded as being excellent, but it was the typical scrambled eggs in a large pan with sausage, etc. It was what you might expect of a free, all you can eat breakfast, if you like that kind of volume.Great value for your money! Clean rooms with much space! Superfriendly staff that will help you with anything! And there is a free shuttle service every half hour!If I ever would come back to Sedona, I will certainly stay here again! Nice place with nice view :-)Beautiful rooms, great service,  great for the price. The only complaint is that the breakfast wasn't as good as the other best western.  The manager there made up for it tho! Highly recommend!The service is great.  The breakfast is free and reasonable.  Safe environment with nice hotel crew :)I recommend this hotel to anyone with a family as well.Greetings, I need the help of anyone who might have stayed at this hotel after March 18th. My mother came to visit March 11-March 18 and stayed at this hotel in room 223. While here she lost two very important items and I'm hoping someone can help me find them. I know this is a long shot but she's heartbroken and I have to at least try and track them down. I'm attaching pictures here. (They aren't great pictures but they're what I have) The earrings are silver looking with a little gold horse head in the center -- they were her mother's. The ring is a basic gold band that was her father's wedding ring. My whole life my mom has worn these things and they mean everything to her. If you see these/have them/know someone who has them please please please contact me. I've been to Twice as Nice and Goodwill with no luck. I'll pay to get them back for her if given the opportunity. Thank you so much.Beware when booking here and you have a change of plans.  Unless you die, or maybe not even then will you be refunded for a stay you previously booked. Even though I called and canceled the reservation, they said I didn't.  Shame on me for not writting down the name of the person I spoke to when I canceled, which was days before the arrival date.  They will not even budge one bit.  We were charged the whole fare plus taxes for a room we did not use...  Being a Best Westen member, I thought they might take that into consideration, but did not.  Oh well I guess they need the money.Hope in reservations is an Angel. Haven't met her yet. Just really appreciate the service and help with making and adjusting my reservations due to an injury. It's the human factor that makes such a difference in how you feel about a place.What can I say but WOW! I never expect perfection but this was as close as it gets! We were able to bring our older dog with us, the room was super clean &amp; smelled fresh, the service was second to none (incredibly friendly, helpful staff), and the views are amazing. This place doesn't have the regular ""hotel"" feel because of how the rooms are located on the hills, which greatly pleased us. The front desk and concierge staff were so helpful &amp; even provided us with a list of pet-friendly restaurants in the area. Plus they give a small container of doggie poo bags to guests with pets. Oh and the breakfast! I've never seen a breakfast spread like this for free. Scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits &amp; gravy, pancakes, fresh cut fruit, 2 flavors of yogurt, granola, oatmeal w/fixins, whole bananas, muffins, toast, coffee, tea, and a selection of juices. We actually looked forward to our breakfast every morning! We didnt use the pool but it wasn't real big. We did use the exercise room &amp; it was small but adequate. No complaints.Will definitely be back again. Thanks!5 minutes from Uptown. Somewhat centrally located, decent room, crazy wild shower head. The view is nice if you're on the right side of the hotel. The AC was extremely loud compared to some other hotels we were at, but we slept well.The first time I came here was with my  then fiance (now husband) 2 years ago when we randomly stayed at this best western. Here's how it went down. We arrive at beautiful Sedona on an insanely hot afternoon and started browsing the shops and restaurants for a place to eat. We randomly met this time share representative that offered us a free stay at the best western if we participate in this time share thing. We said yes of course and later on that night went up to our room, which had GORGEOUS views of the red mountains, and I mean GORGEOUS. I really didn't expect to get much from Best Western, let alone a free room at BW, but I was pleasantly shocked. The room also came with breakfast that was bland, but at least it came with a breakfast. This BW is easily one of the nicest I've seen, an the views....oh the beautiful views!Service here was five star. You will not find better. Rooms smaller than the pictures indicate but nice and clean. Beds and pillows very comfortable and clean. Deck is shared so privacy is limited by other guests and their noise level. No lounge chairs on the deck makes no sense to us. Pool and whirl pool awesome as the do not use chlorine rather a natural cleaning process. First day was not fun as little kids ruined the beautiful view from the hot tub. Second day was perfect as no kids anywhere. Breakfast is one of the best settings and food for a free breakfast. Example was both pork and healthier turkey sausages. Across the street on level two is a path to a Catholic Church. It is a three minute walk. If Catholic you must go. If not go to see the beauty of the grounds. You are a mile from midtown and for 99% of people the hill is too steep to walk. This place is set off from the crowded tourist areas. We would stay here again. Great value for what we paid. Enjoy.","I stayed here with my husband and another couple in June.  At first I was concerned that it was not in the center of town, but it actually worked out much better than I expected! The lobby was pleasant and very clean and modern.  The room (with two queen beds) was comfortable.  All the rooms we saw open onto very large communal terraces.  The terraces have tables, chairs, and a spectacular view of the red rock mountains/formations surrounding Sedona.  Because the hotel is a little higher elevation than the surrounding area, our view was unobstructed.  It was absolutely beautiful especially at sunrise and sunset.The room was large enough for 4 adults to share (and we, as a couple, typically don't share a room, so that means a lot!).  The bathroom was partitioned into two sections, so one person could use the sink area and hair dryer while someone else was using the shower/toilet area.  It worked really well.  The sink and vanity area were very large. The room had lots of outlets, which was important, because we travel with too many laptops, iphones, etc... We decided to use the hot tub after dinner.  They said it closed at 10, but the nice security guard said we could stay until 11pm.  It was HOT and the pool was quite cold!  It was very nice. In the morning, we headed to the included breakfast.  It was way more than we expected for a 'continental breakfast'.  My husband had cereal, muffins, and coffee.  I had a delicious fresh-made waffle and fruit. There was a very nice gentleman restocking everything and cleaning up.  He made sure we had everything we needed. I was very pleasantly surprised with the breakfast.  We went for a morning swim after breakfast.  The breakfast area is located directly next to the pool.  We were impressed with this hotel.  It was $129 for the four of us.  I'd definitely stay here again.The views are stellar and the included breakfast is complete. The room was a little dated, but comfortable, quiet, and clean. We would stay here again without looking elsewhere.I stayed here with my wife while we were on vacation in Sedona.  The hotel has great views of the scenery.  The rooms have a lout A/C unit and this should be retrofitted with more modern cooling systems when it comes time to remodel the place.  The included breakfast was pretty decent and varied each of the days that we stayed at this place.  The hotel staff were always nice and did their best to make us comfortable.Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. From the moment we stepped into the lobby everything was perfect.Everything was spotless, worked perfectly and comfortable.All staff had a glowing attitude the entire time.It was not in the center of town which was good for us since we just wanted a night to relax and get away.We will definitely be back in the near future.Notes:-- Wi-Fi free (and no password needed)-- Coffee is 24/7 in the lobby-- Breakfast is 7a-10a. Slightly better than typical continental breakfast.-- The concierge recommends going up Airport Rd for sunsets. I do not recommend this as it is PACKED, the road is narrow and windy and sometimes people walk up it. If you do, someone is there to nudge you to donate money for the view.-- The center of town shuts down early. It was Saturday night at 7pm and we had a hard time finding something reasonable to eat.-- They offer a shuttle within 5 miles for free until 10pm (use this for the sunset view up above)-- Parking is freeI went here with my family on a trip to see the Grand Canyon, Vermilion Cliffs, Antelope Canyon, and (of course) Sedona. We definitely chose the right place for good views, because this place had absolutely wonderful views! You could see all around you on the humongous shared patio, or just from a window. This is defiantly the place to go if you want to get a good view. The rooms are clean, and pretty spacious. The bathrooms are clean, and medium sized. Breakfast is free, with eggs, toast, coffee, sausages, potatoes, and a neat automatic pancake machine. There is a small gym with a TV in case you want to workout, and a nice lobby with a fire you can throw pine cones and cinnamon sticks in, plus computers with WiFi you can use for free. There is a free shuttle that will take you to downtown, too. If we come to Sedona again, we will defiantly come here!We stopped here on the way from NorCal to Louisiana. I honestly have not one bad thing to say! This hotel was amazing. We booked it while having lunch at a restaurant by the Hyatt, thinking it was the hotel right in Uptown as you come into town on the main strip. This one is about 2 miles down and around.  We were upset until we realized how amazing the hotel was.  It feels like you're in a remote location.  They gave us a very generous military discount ($125) as compared to other hotels in the area that seemed to run $250+.  Our room was very clean, updated and modern...comfy bed, clean carpets, nice window treatments, and a roomy bathroom with a huge granite countertop.  They offer a free shuttle service to anywhere you want to go.  The driver was super nice! It runs every 30 minutes until 10pm.  They are pet friendly and provided us with a list of restaurants that are also pet friendly.  They had the crib set up in our room prior to arrival. Free and fast wifi. The views are incredible. You may not have a view from your room but they have 5 terraces that are spectacular (and pet friendly). Their free breakfast was the best I've ever seen. They had everything from eggs, sausage, seasoned potatoes to pancakes, waffles, cereal, fresh fruit, oatmeal, etc. Coffee was good and had a machine with flavored creamers (it's the simple things right?)  They had indoor/outdoor seating.  The staff was impeccable. Tom thanks for everything!  I cannot wait to come back to Sedona and stay with y'all again!!!When you think Best Western, you usually don't think of the best location in town. This one is the exception. Views are magnificent and just a short drive from the hot spots without being in the congested main area. Rooms were clean and well appointed. Some minor snags: our phone didn't work and neither did the remote, and there didn't seem to be much interest from the Front Desk in fixing either problem.Free breakfast, but go early. It's a mob scene. Go early.Pool is small with an adjoining hot tub. Small exercise room (no views).There's a nice mall with a couple restaurants and a great food store right behind the hotel.We paid $200 for a night in March with tax.When I go to culturally cool places like Sedona, I will normally pick a local hotel over a chain for a more immersive experience. However, we read the great reviews for this Best Western and decided to try it out. I'm so glad we did! I really did love it! The hotel is set into a hill and designed to blend unobtrusively into the locale - which is totally appropriate for any building in a town where the landscape is the star attraction. The service was excellent, the staff was friendly and the room was spacious and nice. On top of that, the complimentary breakfast each morning was excellent! I'd definitely go back.Great family hotel! It is what one expects from a Best Western. It was clean,comfortable and the views were great! I miss sitting on the patio. The breakfast was wonderful and my son loved the sausages. we had a few issues such as the fridge not working. I mentioned it to the front desk, went out to dinner and their was a new working fridge upon our return-very happy with how fast they corrected the problem. Only complaint I have but would still return is the very little shade at the pool a few umbrellas would be nice but maybe due to the wind it might not be safe.  We stayed 5 nights and had a wonderful stay!Stayed last weekend with three kids. Amazing, amazing views. Incredible nice staff and spotless rooms.Was very glad I found this place on the Internet. Breakfast was not a gourmet but hey, who cares? It came with the room and offered a nice selection of eggs, pancakes, cereal etc. Started early and got a bit over crowded by 8:00am, still a great value for families. Everyone likes to get an early start this time of the year because of the weather anyways.Pool was a bit small but I would definitely stay again! Did I mention the gorgeous views?Lovely views. Helpful, friendly staff. Rooms are OK - nothing special. My favorite part of staying here is that one can hike or run on the trails in the Cocochina National Forest after a day at work. And, of course, Sedona is magical.Awesome views of the red rocks from your room (and the terrace in front of your room).The beds are very comfy.  The rooms are decorated well with some nice mounted photos of local scenery.  The wi-fi is easy to hook into.Only minus would be the room's individual cooling/heating unit - pretty noisy.We enjoyed our 2 night stay here during a March trip through the area. It was good to be a bit away from the busy-ness of Sedona (which is far more touristy than I had imagined). This hotel has fantastic views Friendly enough staff with a helpufl concierge to answer questions about hikes and local places. Basic hotel breakfast in a crowded room. Decent pool and jacuzzi which we all enjoyed. Good place to stay in Sedona.Beautiful views. Breakfast was fine, parking is good, and the location is excellent.The people who work there are very nice, but in all honesty, we had the following issues:The air conditioner in our room was so loud that we were awakened every time it kicked on. Unfortunately, it was too hot outside to leave it turned off. The curtains do not close tightly against the wall and anyone passing by can see into the room if your lights are on at night.The hot tub was lukewarm at best.The toilet would not flush and my husband ended up repairing it rather than asking for help since we were all ready to go to bed.Though the view was amazing and the staff is great, next time we will stay somewhere where we can actually sleep through the night.I was at this hotel in July 2014 with a large group of family and friends (13 people) and occupied 4 adjoining rooms on the second floor. From check in to check out, we had a fabulous experience. We arrived rather late, and we were very surprised that our rooms were held on the same floor and together. The front desk clerk was VERY accommodating and nice, we went later to ask for wine glasses and he offered us a complimentary bottle. The fact that there's no elevator didn't matter at all, because the way the hotel is situated down a slope, each level was accessible from the street, we got a luggage cart from the lobby and we were fine. The best part was that both nights we were there, we stayed out (late) on the very spacious balcony talking, listening to music and having drinks, and NOT ONCE did anyone come out to complain! Oh, and in the morning we woke up to a magnificent view! I never made it to the included breakfast, but the ones in our party who did, said it was just OK. I would definitely return to this very well run property!In planning our trip to Sedona, I definitely looked at all the hotels and helped narrow it down by a review...the breakfast is what enticed me along with the views.  Nothing disappointed.  The views were wonderful, the breakfast was great and surprised us and the room and staff was wonderful.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!Extremely clean and well kept. Staff was  very friendly. Our room had a gorgeous view of the red rock and we really enjoyed the patio. Bed and pillows were pretty comfy and the room was nice. I would have given 5 stars but the complimentary breakfast wasn't good. Eggs were cold. Coffee was burnt. Not a good last impression....Stayed in a pet friendly room after having a not successful check in at Sedonal Real. The facility was very accomodating and let us view the room prior to choosing to stay. Continental breakfast was ok. Staff was wonderful! I would def recommend this place!This BW is outside of the touristy part of Sedona.  It is cheaper than the BW in that part of Sedona and more than makes up for its location with the views.  These are easily some of the best views in Sedona.  One can sit on the porch outside the room for hours.  The rooms are clean with good beds. The staff is always friendly.  The breakfast has a wide variety of foods from waffels to cold cereal.  I last stayed here in January 2010 and liked it enough to stay again last night.  One of the reasons I booked it again was they were offering a $99 a night special that included $100 gift certificates at Tlaquapue. Turns out those were actually things like '10% off when you spend $50 or more' at certain stores.  So not so great.   Didn't matter that much to me as I don't care for Tlaquapue.  Will definitely stay at this BW again.Perhaps it's because this place holds a special place in my heart...but I really loved our stay. We were crazy and drove up on my her motorcycle.  When we pulled up they were not only accommodating, but they also gave us a little gift bag type deal with a compass and some other little niceties.  The room was nice and the bed was comfy.  The views were beautiful and their complimentary breakfast was amazing!  It's not your typical continental deal with some apples and cereal, although those were available, too.  They had two waffle irons hot and ready for me to come make a tasty breakfast delight.  They had regular batter or blueberry.  I just like my waffle plain,so I poured it in and let it do its magic, all while I looked out at the beautiful red rocks of Sedona.  There was juice, yogurt, bagels and toast, coffee and milk, as well.  I always look to Best Western first when planning a trip because of the great first experience I had with them.","A decent breakfast, and wifi, but a cockroach and bed bug in the room.  Need I say more?I have mixed feelings about this hotel.  Staff was amazing.  Extremely friendly.  Rooms were very small.  We were traveling with a dog and when we checked into our room it wreaked of chemicals.  The rooms here use the old heating and air conditioning units that are very loud.  Bathroom toiletries were nice.  The hotel itself looks nice from the outside and they do have nice terraces on the second floor for viewing.  Our dog was too old to get up the stairs so we just opened our room door (partly to clear out the chemical smell) and enjoyed the view.  We did not have as nice of a view on the dog friendly side of the hotel but, I don't think you can find a bad view in Sedona.  Breakfast was atrocious.  Food was mediocre but, the horrible part was the extremely small space to get your food amongst the crowds of people.  We ate outside and it was rather cold.  On a good note, the very friendly staff gave me a list of dog friendly eateries in town and let me know that you can order room service from the Mesa grill.  We took advantage of Mesa Grill room service and all I can say is definitely order if you are tired!  They are expensive but, worth it.  They bring everything just as if you were getting room service at a nice hotel and the food was fabulous!  I highly recommend the mango mousse cake!Great place! I have paid more money to stay at hotels that miss the mark - The Best Western Sedona is clean, has well appointed rooms, friendly staff, free breakfast and fantastic views. Someone else mentioned a noisy air conditioner in their  room - mine made a little noise as well - no problem however - I paid three times as much for a room at a Sedona resort hotel with the same problem - I highly recommend this hotel and I will stay here again the next time I am in town.Really liked this place. Would definitely stay here again. Love that they are pet friendly! The room they gave us was super good for dogs, there was even a pretty trail to walk the dogs on just up the road. The hotel room was clean and comfortable and it was very convenient to have coffee and breakfast at the hotel in the morning. Nice pool area and it was super nice to be able to walk to the upper level of the hotel and watch the sunset. Super pretty views when walking around the parking lot and love that it is walking distance to New Frontiers market, the best grocery store ever. Checking in and out was super easy and everyone was nice.I don't know what Walt's talking about.  I thought this was the best value in town.  Then again, I booked on the Best Western website and pre-paid to get one of the cheapest rates available.  I think we paid around  $130 a night for a terrace room with an awesome view.I believe all of the rooms at this hotel are terraced, which means you have an awesome, panoramic view of the red rock mountains, which is why 99.9% of people go to Sedona in the first place.The room itself was spacious, with two queen beds and a very modern, clean bathroom.  The only thing that was lacking was storage space.  There was this one small closet tucked into the corner of the room and a small bureau that was just big enough to hold the about 37"" TV.  Otherwise, there was a table/desk that was big enough to hold a laptop and a couple sheets of paper side-by-side.  There was definitely room for larger pieces of furniture.We had good service from the employees.  My favorite employee was the guy who worked the breakfast room on the weekend.  Yes, you get free breakfast with your stay.  They say it's continental, but I'd call it continental plus.  In addition to the fresh-made pastries and bagels and bread, along with jelly and peanut butter and butter and syrup, there were hard boiled eggs and whole fresh fruit.  They were a bit lacking on the fresh fruit side, but I'd give that up to the location more than anything else.  I'm not sure where you'd grow produce in the desert.  The best part, though, were the make-your-own waffles!  It was just like being back in the dorms!  They had two industrial waffle irons and the batter was ready made for your pouring pleasure.  The weekend we were there, the guy said he felt like being crazy and threw some blueberries into the batter.  YUM.  Blueberry belgian waffles are so good.As for the guy himself, he gives great advice on places to eat in the area.  I asked him where the locals go for good cheap eats and had a lot to say.  And he was very nice to boot.This hotel is about a mile away from the ""center"" of town, but I didn't mind at all.  We had a car so we drove the 3 minutes (literally) into town without a problem.  Also, the hotel is across the street from the turn off to the airport in the sky - which also has a great view.  We saw the other Best Western that Walt was talking about and it just didn't seem to have the same relaxed ambience and awesome view that ours did.  Plus, it's a whole lot more expensive.  I would definitely stay at the Best Western Inn of Sedona every time I'm in town.  And I do want to go back as soon as I can afford it!A perfect honeymoon Inn - and we were not on our honeymoon. Stayed in the #300 rooms (top level) with wonderful view of the sedona red rocks. Wonderful with cool clear evenings. Amenities were very nice including the morning breakfast.This is one of the finer BW Inns we have stayed at in the USA. Nice nice, nice. Friendly staff too.I am bummed. Everything ""looks"" nice but nothing worked. The info says it has been recently remodeled. It has a beautiful view from every room and balconies accessible as well. BUT the shower was a bullet of water that was pathetic. It was so bad that we didn't use it the second morning because it is too much trouble to deal with. The A/C was horrible. The free ""deluxe"" breakfast was disappointing also. Nothing hot. No meats. All cold items with the exception of a waffle maker. And there are bugs. Crawling ones and flying ones- in the room.  Do not stay in room 109. Asked to be moved but.....no go. And they had vacancies. So I said my review would reflect the poor treatment. They didn't seem to care.A 3 star hotel at a 4 star price. I stayed there in August for just one night. We were able to get a nice ""mountain"" facing room with a large common terrace. Nothing fancy at all. But for almost $200 after everything was said and done, I expected a little more. Location Location Location. Blah. Stay at the other Best Western in the east part of town. From that one you can walk the shops and whatnot.I don't know what hotel these other people stayed at but this hotel is by far one of the worst I've ever stayed at. When we went to check in the lady at the front desk said that the computers were down and we couldn't check in. She suggested that we take the shuttle in to town and come back a little bit later to check in. She gave me a card so I could call them to send the shuttle. It runs every hour on the half hour. We went into town and looked around, it was 2:15P and we decided to call the shuttle to pick us up at 3:00P. We went to have a sandwich and called the front desk to ask them to send the shuttle at 3:30PM instead. Whomever answered the phone started to argue with me and said he would send the shuttle at 3:10PM, I explained to him that he could send it whenever he wanted but, we would not be ready until 3:30P. We went to the pick up spot at 3:20P and started to wait. At 3:45P I called to find out if the shuttle had been dispatched yet. The lady that answered said she would send it right away.The hotel is three minutes from the pick up spot (I timed it on the shuttles clock), and this guy picked us up at 3:55P. I went to check in and when the lady at the front desk was finished with her personal phone call, I complained to her about the shuttle. She said she was very sorry. We went to our room (Number 136), at the furthest west side of the hotel, in the very back.The people above were moving the patio furniture around and we could hear it in the room, as well as there conversations. I went back to the front desk and asked to be moved, as you guessed, no rooms available but, she could absolutely do something tomorrow, the day after Memorial Day. She told me that I should come in the morning turn in the key and talk whoever was at the front desk, she'd leave a note for them. I did as she asked and the guy said ""sorry"" because I had booked through Expedia there was nothing he could do, first floor rooms are reserved for third party bookings and there was nothing he could do. The hotel had been emptied. There were only two other couples on our side of the hotel. Yet, Best Western employees could (or would) do nothing to move us to a room with a nicer view than the vending machines. I understand your policy but, if you have the rooms available and no one was in them, what would it have hurt? You might have gotten a completly different review saying how great you were but, I have to say this Best Western is severely lacking in customer service, and their free breakfast make a school cafeteria look good. If I could give minus stars, I would.Stayed one night, and wish I had stayed two. Great convenient location. You could walk to a store or a couple of restaurants, or take a really short drive wherever you wanted to go. Check in was about two minutes, and checking out was even faster. Kids enjoyed the pool, and they are pet-friendly (the hotel not the pool). There is also a gym if you want one. Rooms are neat, clean and decent size for a hotel, with a separate door for the powder room and bathroom, which is nice so you can use the sink while someone is taking a shower. Get a free breakfast in the morning too. I enjoyed having morning coffee out on the terrace outside our room. I would stay there again for sure.This is a great hotel!  The staff are ultra friendly (and most we've met love dogs), the rooms have fabulous views, and you also aren't in the middle of downtown, which lets you enjoy those views without all the hustle going on around you.  If you want to be in the center of it all, this will undoubtedly disappoint, but aren't most folks here for the scenery?The breakfast is toast, waffles, some fruit, cereal, instant oatmeal, yogurt, breads, bagels, hard-boiled eggs, juice, milk, and coffee (sorry if I missed something).And the price is certainly comparable to other places in Sedona.  For the room, views, and service, it seems about right.We loved this hotel!! - Amazing views!!!! - A decent price. - Very large rooms - Very clean!! (I always travel with my own sheets and pillows..and i didn't even feel like i needed them here) - Love the closed off powder room, separate from the bathroom and bedroom - Pet friendly - great continental breakfast - and the guy making all the food in the morning was incredibly friendly! If we travel to Sedona again.. we will definitely be staying here.",,"['place', 'gets', 'stars', 'superb', 'customer', 'service', 'excellent', 'due', 'kindness', 'helpfulness', 'place', 'also',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/bell-rock-inn-sedona,Bell Rock Inn,3.0,$$,63,"This place was a very pleasant surprise! My girlfriend and I took a last minute road trip to Sedona from Vegas and booked our room on a weeknight for way less than their neighbors were asking for at last minute prices. We were welcomed by a pair of sweet as pie little ladies at the front desk and then directed over to the concierge desk to meet Debra, who is way too good of a host to be in a small town! Nevertheless, she was awesome! She knew every restaurant in town and helped us pick which one to go to for a ""fabulous dinner"" (as she put it and was right) she also suggested we take a drive up one road for a perfect view of the stars which my little lady just loved! (Ask Deb which road) Aside from the service being great the room was also superb! Granted this isn't the Hyatt suites but you will get more than you expect with this place. We will definitely be going back again for sure and can't wait to see Debra when we get back that way again!PS They will try to sell you on some kind of repeat client program. I didn't go for it even though it does seem like a pretty cool deal. But even though I declined I still received excellent service.BEWARE- THIS PLACE TURNS AWAY ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY OFFICERS AND FAMILIES WITH PAID AND CONFIRMED RESERVATIONS. Diamond resorts international sold us a 3 night stay with a timeshare tour at the Bell Rock Inn, Sedona, AZ just about a month ago. I explained to the person I spoke with that we weren't planning to see Sedona again anytime soon, unless they happened to have a room this December 26 so we could stay there on our way to Santa Fe and Colorado. They did!  Yay!  Upon arriving at our resort after a 12 hour drive, we were told by Sheila at the front desk that we had no reservation at that hotel. Ever. I produced my bank statement showing the charge, one paper confirmation letter and one email, all from diamond resorts international. The manager, Seth Gibson was called, and after a very long time searching the computer, he offered to rent us a room for the regular rate of $286 a night plus resort fees and taxes. We refused to pay and said we will just sleep in the lobby. Set up camp. Watched while three other couples checked in behind us. Manager called back and offered us a room for the rack rate of $98 a night but only for two nights, not the three we paid for.  NO THANK YOU. The lobby works for us. Just as the kids finally wound down to sleep on the lobby couch and floor, the manager called the police on us for trespassing. That obviously didn't work, since we had a confirmation letter in hand. We explained what had happened. The officer called Seth Gibson back twice to talk him into finding us a room at another property for at least the night. The manager refused, so we were forced to wake our kids at 1:00 am and drive 2.5 hours in 18 degree ice and snow weather on a very windy mountain road, which had our 9 year old terrified and bawling her eyes out in the back seat until 3 am about how were all going to die. We didn't die. We made it the next nearest motel with a room. Found one in Holbrook, paid for a night, passed out at 3:30 am. We just left to see what we can do at this point about the rest of our 9 day trip. DO NOT BOOK at this resort or with any diamond international resorts/hotels. They will call the police and kick out an Army family on Christmas break with paid and confirmed reservations, even in the middle of a snowy night on a long mountain road with two young children scared, tired and crying.Yesterday my friend drove 12 hours with her family, including two children to Sedona. She had a confirmed reservation at Bell Rock Inn for 3 nights, the charge had already been made on her credit card. When she arrived at midnight after a day of driving, she was told there was no record of her reservation. She was able to present the staff with her email confirmation and proof of credit card charges. SETH the manager, (who was on the phone with the staff at the desk &amp; not present) said her only option was to pay twice as much for the last remaining room she was already charged for. While this was happening, they checked another guest into the last room. It was 18 degrees outside and all other hotels in the area were completely sold out.My friend &amp; her MILITARY family sat in the lobby trying to figure out what to do, and the staff CALLED THE POLICE on them. They were kicked out into the 18 degree night at 1am with nowhere to go. They had to drive another 2 hours on icy roads at 1am to the only hotel they could find with a vacancy. This is absolutely unacceptable and I hope anyone reading this chooses to stay elsewhere.SEE PHOTOS FOR PROOF OF RESERVATION AND HER ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENEDI want of the people that came here to stay for just a day or two instead of a week and I will tell you this as long as the rates hold to be reasonable I will be back for an entire week,  because there's a certain peace to Sedona, and it's felt here as well.  It's south of the hustle and bustle of the touristy areas, and that's just fine with me.  Opening my curtains to see Bell Rock RIGHT THERE...  Yeah. I'll be back.I found a deal on groupon and since camping would have costed the same (i know right?!) we decided to stay warm. After checking in, I kind of changed my mind and was mad that I didn't camp. Check in took 10 mins but after that we were told to go to concierge. We drove for 8 hours and we were exhausted, even after mentioning that we are very tired, the lady managed to keep us there for something that felt like a lifetime to tell us about the sales and promos and places.... If you want to interest people, you need to know that it won't happen when they are tired. Very clingy! The next morning we went in to get an address, a new girl was at concierge helping a family PRINTING OUT A COUPON FOR 1 HOUR! I mean, you can lift you head and say, be right with you, but she kept calling people asking them how to get the printer to work from 9am to 10. We just walked out... Waste of time, this place.After a delightful trip to Flagstaff, my wife and I spent a night here in Sedona as a detour on our way back into the inferno of Phoenix in July.I booked through Priceline's Name Your Own Price. It was a good value, considering the spacious room and fairly well-kept property. Overall, it all fell a little bit short of my expectations for a three-star hotel (in particular, the service felt strained and less than professional). The front desk staff and housecleaning staff went above and beyond when my wife forgot a couple items in our room the morning we left. But no serious complaints about our room or the hotel itself.My one and only serious complaint has to do with the ""concierge"". Immediately after checking in, we were given a raffle ticket (a little odd in itself) and sent to the concierge desk behind us. There, we were immediately greeted by a slightly-too-friendly man who first tried to push an Italian restaurant on us (to the extent that we wondered whether he got commissions from the restaurant), then tried to sell us a ""4-nights-for-the-price-of-3 exclusive offer"" for the hotel chain. When I said no, he replied, ""May I ask why not?""Not only did this all feel sleazy and unbecoming of a resort hotel (the kind of establishment that, in my experience, doesn't try to sell you extra stuff - you've already paid for it, and their job is simply to provide you the best experience possible with no expectations than that you'll have a great experience and want to come back). I'd go so far as to characterize it as a breach of trust. Like a tour guide, a waiter, or a sommelier, a concierge is not a salesman. He (or she) is a professional who is paid to put your interests first and guide your through unfamiliar territory toward those things that, in their well-informed judgement, will give you the best experience possible. This is an important and honorable role, and one the name of which the Red Rock Inn's man showed himself entirely unworthy.Despite the hotel's good qualities, I cannot recommend that anyone patronize an establishment that does business this way.We stayed for two nights for a weekend getaway. Overall we had a great experience. The hotel was in a great location and we loved the room amenities lik e the kitchen.My two biggest complaints were the bed and the shower. The mattress was very uncomfortable. I couldn't find a good spot to sleep and woke up on incredible passion both mornings. The short was the worst! The shower head had such small openings that it felt like the streams were etching your skin.Overall it was a great experience. I would stay again, I would even take the kids because of the pullout couch.****If you got trick into staying here for a 90-120 minutes timeshare presentation and have a 3 nights stay at a good deal, read on. You will thank me for it*****Location: The hotel is very close to a main road. You can hear traffic noises depending on which building you stay in. It was extremely difficult to pull out from their driveway going to uptown Sedona since the traffic is heavy in that area. Service: front desk was very friendly. I specifically requested to look at the room before I checked in due to so many negative reviews that I saw via yelp. They were very corporative and did not give me a hard time about my odd request. This review isn't based on the service of the hotel staffs at all (keep reading.....)Hotel room: we stayed at a remodeled studio at building D. I guess since we are here for a timeshare presentation, they put us up in one of their ""nice room"". The room is decent and clean except the hallway does have a strong smell of cleaning materials (just like what other yelpers said - and I should have listened). The wall was so thin. I got woken up 1:30 am in the morning because I could hear someone above me moving chairs and walking around in their own room for 20 minutes straight. They also didn't install padding on the door. It slams shut whenever people go in and out of their rooms. It is super loud. Even when someone leaves their room 7 rooms down from us, I still could hear it. Timeshare presentation: 90-120 minutes? Dream on. They made us sat there for 3 hours. By the time I walked out, I was completely drained, hungry and upset. They started out by assigning u to a person who did the presentation. Nice lady. Her manager, co owner of the timeshare program, came by once in a while trying to up sell it even more. These 10 years contract is approx $23k at 18% interest rate (WHAT!). When you finally said no to both of them, the third person showed up from ""the corporate"" asking you to purchase a $3000 package with no contract. Basically, they keep lowering and sweetening the deal until you breakdown and buy something. Rating: the reason I didn't purchase it is because (1) if Bell Rock Inn is one of their nicest timeshare hotels? God I am scared to see the rest of them on the list. (2) their interest rate is ridiculously high. (3) they didn't stick with their commitment of 120 minutes max and made us sat there until I was sick of it. I never like high pressure sales. If they would have given me more time to think about it, I might probably would have re-considered it since I do travel quite a bit. (4) I am in a committed relationship with my partner and they demand to see documentations to proof that we are a committed couple including driver license or marriage certificate when we finalized our reservation with the hotel over the phone (last minute request by the way) - which was completely invasion of personal privacy. We were scheduled to stay there for 3 nights and end up checking out on the 2nd night. If you prefer 4-5 stars hotel stays like I do, don't come here. You will regret it like I did. Staying here + the presentation ruins my weekend up in Sedona and leave a bad taste in my mouth.Our experience began when we were assaulted at check in with creepy calls of ""Welcome Home"" from 5 or 6 staff members. Check in seemed to take quite a while, but the desk clerk was very polite. He then sent us over to the concierge, who was pushy beyond belief about viewing their time share program. We paid for our rooms and didn't feel we should have been subjected to this. She just wouldn't let us go to our room! After finally mak8ng it out of the office we voqed not to head back in. The room was dated, but clean. The ceiling was patched in several spots and the curtain valance had some brownish water stains on it (I have photos I will post.) Just much more aged than I expected. Disappointing.So far worst experience.They called my room 3 times ON THE HOTEL PHONE at 9am. I was sleeping and the phone woke me up. I was pissed as I didn't ask for a wake up call, nonetheless 3 calls! I finally picked the phone up the 3rd time thinking it was urgent. When I answered, some weird ass middle eastern sounding song was playing, as if I was on hold to India. I said Hello a few times and no one answered. Pissed me off more.I unhooked the phone so they don't keep calling pointlessly with Indian music. So now if there's a real emergency, they won't even be calling me. That's fucking annoying to know. But I'm not going to deal with being woken up every morning with calls upon calls upon calls, until I answer the damn thing!(Update at 1:30pm: Didn't notice there were two phones in the room. The phone just rang over and over and over again. So whatever the purpose of these calls are it wasn't for a wake up call. What the Fuck!? Now both phones are unplugged. Very very annoying!)This ""resort"" is a joke!Walls are paper thin. Next door neighbors bathtub and bathroom fan sounds like you're on the battle front. You can hear when people walk up the stairs. It sounded like a pack of rhino was running up the stairs and through the hallway.When someone walks in the hallway or up the stairs, the entire room shakes. No joke. I'm surprised this place is still standing.The heat doesn't go very high and it gets cold in here. Also: The fireplace isn't a fireplace. Its not even a heater. I had it on for more than an hour and it didn't get hot once. Not even lukewarm. Not even cold. Nothing came from it.(update: the heater doesnt even work at all. Cheap place doesnt update anything.)The tv doesn't turn much so you have to creak your neck weird. Its designed to watch tv at the kitchen table. In a studio unit, this does not make sense.There was a weird stain on the bed like someone got murdered here.I constantly hear someone trying to open my door too. I don't feel safe here. This happened late last night too, so it wasn't housekeeping. This room is really dusty too. Woke up with crazy allergies. This only happens when it is really dusty in a room. I haven't had issues with Sedona/VOC with allergies. So it's the room. The only thing nice is there is a full kitchen. But I'd rather choose a hotel with a small fridge and better quality.This place isn't worth it. So far, nothing but issues. The phone issue is what pissed me off most. Who does that!? I didn't tell them to give me a wake-up call and they gave me THREE wake-up calls, one right after the other. Fucking assholes. I'm thinking they did it because I wouldn't stay to talk more about the timeshare last night. Shady! Do you really want to stay in a place where they don't respect the guests and get revenge on you?We were early and checked in pretty quickly. Everyone is right, stay away from the concierge desk... Holy cow! Talk about being bombarded. I think they need to change that. It's good to have good customer service, but not good to be pushy, anyways. Our room was great! Tons of room and love that they have a kitchenette, great stay for a long get away, the only downfall of the room was the bed, it wasn't comfortable at all. The WiFi was sometimes slow, but that's normal usually with everyone using it. I think I would definitely stay here again maybe even with a more updated suite! But you can't beat the price!Very nice place, reserved a studio and was expecting a small room..... studio. We got a very large room, way more than we were expecting and paid for. Our room looks out upon Bell Rock, well through the parking lot and over the next building.  Room seems very clean, and after reading the other reviewers I had doubts. I wonder if they were really here.Pretty tacky place. We had terrible picture in the room and asked them to replace. Of course, they never did.I'm torn about this review. I hate to give any outfit with decent rooms and good prices one star, but I will never stay here again, and can't justify a higher rating based on one serious issue.   I knew this was a timeshare before I arrived, so made sure to avoid the ""concierge"", whose function is to try to sell you a unit.    The room itself (studio) was more than large enough, had a two-burner stove, microwave, full-size fridge, dishwasher, built-in granite dining table, king-size bed, large (if awkwardly placed) TV, decent seating area, and a little patio. Rustic 50's ""cowboy"" decor, but tastefully done, and on the first night, I was thoroughly pleased with myself for finding such a decent place at such a great price (for the Sedona area).   Then I got up the next morning, went to take a shower, and found a large live centipede cruising around the bottom of the bathtub! Now, I know I have a major bug phobia, but to have this first thing in the morning was super jarring!    I washed my new pal down the drain, took my shower, and headed out to the living room ...  where I found a TWO INCH LONG COCKROACH on his back, waving his legs in the air and twitching his feelers! Totally gross. Covered him with paper towels, stomped him, wiped up the carnage, and continued on.   Then the next morning, there was ANOTHER TWO INCH LONG COCKROACH on the kitchen floor! I called the front desk, and was told ""... I can send somebody out from engineering. They won't spray or anything, but they can talk to you about it..."" As I said to him then, ""What would be the point of that""?   One bug is a nasty anomaly. Three of them in two days (especially when two are giant cockroaches) is flat-out disgusting! Would strongly recommend against this place for this reason alone.Stayed here for a quick getaway. Front desk was very nice and helpful.Concierge was so rude. I wrote management and I still dont feel I was taken seriously. Concierge was so upset I wanted to just enjoy my time and not take his resort tour. Room was fairly clean bathroom was not cleaned very well. Room did have a great view!Adding to my previous review: Well D'oh- there is a grocery store (Webers) near Bell Rock Inn- walking distance, even.On my most recent visit, I stayed in a studio in the building parallel to 89A, in a rear unit facing the pool. It was configured very well and perfect for one person. Although I missed the full kitchen, the two burner stove top and microwave served me fine. Decor in the studio was more ""Western"" than in the 2 story one bed. I imagine facing the pool would not be ideal in the summer, but in winter/spring months, it was not noisy.We liked the Bell Rock Inn -- cute room with ""fireplace"" and a nice little kitchen. Very clean and the bed was super comfy. Nice to have a king size and a queen size pullout for the kiddos, too. Hot tub and pool were very nice and the staff was great. Yes, you get a sales presentation but it was low key and not hideously pushy like most. Would definitely stay here again -- great location right by Bell Rock Trail, Fireside Coffee, Tara Thai, etc.We stayed in the John Wayne suite, and first glance you would think that's great but you'd be a fucken liar, first off the door is squeakier than a goddamn 5 year old, then every single door doesn't fit in the correct spots so you look like a psycho trying to close and open every door, all the showers are broken as hell and you're either burning or freezing, and last of all and probably the worse the fuckin table is stickier than a licked lollipop and I'm currently writing a review while it's stuck and everything is stuck. F*ck this place...Bell Rock InnSedona, ArizonaThis is a totally negative review based on my interaction with Hotel personnel regarding their handling of my cancellation request. I did have a reservation with cancellation fee costs. My 76 year old wife came down with a recurrence of shingles. The 12 hour drive would be extremely difficult for her. I requested a cancellation with reasonable fees. They refused to negotiate. They displayed a lack of consideration and compassion. Their greed and avarice prevailed. I cancelled  my reservation and accepted the full cost of the reservation, their version of cancellation fees.Bob TarozziWe got hotel via Priceline wasn't able to find are reservation for hour and a half. Had to call Priceline and wait around for resolution. Bed is hard. Shower doesn't drain and iron doesn't work. It is spacious with up stairs living room and kitchen.  Not my top choice.","Room was ok.  Buyer beware.  I booked the room online on their website.  I received confirmation but it didn't give me a price.  When I arrived they overcharged me by $50.  I had to jump through hoops to get the correct price.Stayed for 2 nights with our kids (11,9 and 3) Dora at the front desk was very nice, as was Moy (I think her name) at the concierge desk. Totally recommend for families, it is great having a kitchenette. Not super fancy (again, great for families) Yes they try to get you to listen to the timeshare presentation and buy a further stay within the next year.... But it IS a timeshare, that is their job, we knew that going in so I have no complaints (and I politely declined)We got a good price on Expedia but wouldn't stay here again, room was okay. Not very close to the main Sedona area. STAY AWAY FROM THE CONCIERGE DESK!! They will try many times to sell you a time share. A daily Resort Fee was added on to the bill in addition to what we already paid.My advise, Keep looking at other options.The room has nice facilities esp. The kitchen. Lots of clean towels available. The room did smell a little musty but i guess most hotels are like that; hence 4 stars. BUT will still go back because the hotel is generally ok and has facilities that cater for my dog. Love it!The stay was great. The room comfy and cozy fold out couch kitchen. Frank was awesome booking us a dinner time. Very clean and everyone is nice. TV folds out away from wall. Staff was awesome. Most def recommend. One thing plz... More equipment for the gymThe staff was excellent and the location great!  The actual room was adequate.  It needed a little TLC but functioned fine.  Few minor issues...bathroom door looked like it had been clawed by a pet who was perhaps left in there too long.  Internet was up and down.  The refrigerator had a pretty loud compressor that you didn't really notice until you were trying to sleep.  But overall not a bad place and it was clean.Yes, I would stay here again but it's not the best place I've ever visited.  What we liked best was that it was quiet and in a great location...walking distance to fantastic trails!  Just enough restaurants to avoid driving up to Sedona too.My sister and I met in in New Mexico for our Uncles Memorial.  We decided to stay at the Bell Rock Inn on out way back to California for some R&amp;R.  I became ill the night before our first nights stay at the Bell Rock and called them to change our reservation to a day later as I could not travel due to being so dehydrated.  The receptionist Shelia, basically said to bad and charged us anyway.  Granted it wasn't 24 hours that we tried to change the reservation, it was 20 hours.  Where is some human compassion?  So we traveled there to catch our second night.  As we checked in, Shelia was there and remembered our call, it was obvious I still was not feeling very well, she was very rude!  (Very nice to the wealthy LOOKING couple prior to us checking in by the way)   She was going to charge us the resort fee for the night we weren't even there but took the charge off as a favor (10.00)  We asked about staying another night and were sent to the Concierge, that is when I realized that this was a time share property and we got the sales pitch from Brandon, whom was very sweet, he offered us the second night at no cost if we went to the presentation the following morning.  Finally we agreed as we really wanted to rest and check out the beautiful town.  Brandon was suppose to call our room with in a hour to let us know if we were going to go to the 8 am presentation or the 11 am.  Brandon never called so before bed I called and spoke to someone at the desk, Brandon was gone and she said I would just have to wait until the following day.  I woke to the phone at 7:30 am to some offer of a cheaper room rate at a future date and no mention of the prior agreement.  (Really? 7:30 am?)Basically our trip was ruined and I will NEVER stay there again!Who wants to go to Sedona and spend the whole time messing with hotel reservations and sales people?  Terrible business practice, poor customer service and rude Shelia made this choice a bad one for us!The room was nice and clean, but small.  You can't watch tv in bed as the tv is mounted on the wall and can't turn towards the bed.  NOTHING SPECIAL!Upon check out, we were again charged the 10.00 resort fee for the night we weren't there!  You have been warned!!!!!!!I tore my Achilles tendon and will have to get surgery. I called this hotel to cancel my reservation, or perhaps get them to let me take the trip after I recover. They told me that I would have to know for certain the dates I want to change my trip to, or else the request would be denied!  And it would be subject to Priceline's availability (I booked the trip through them), and I would have to pay whatever extra fees Priceline chooses to impose. What a shameful, shameful response. This is no way to treat someone.  Shame on this hotel, on its own Diamond Resorts, and on Priceline.  I should be focused on the surgery I have to undergo, and the lengthy recovery, and not this. I was looking forward to this trip.I would strongly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel.We stayed at  this  resort  based  on the  great price  and convenient  location. The room was clean. It rained, water was seeping in from the floor  tiles on the first floor. The worst part is the annoying guy and his wife acting all friendly after you check in. He literally starts trying to arrange  your whole vacation and  include selling time shares. I caught on right away, ended the discussion and he turned cold as ice with a real negative attitude. He  also  stunk of stale  cigarette smoke too.  After staying at  this resort I started receiving a dozen or more telemarketer calls from  different  states. Finally, I answer and i hear young men acting silly on the phone and I say loudly, hello, he responds that he is calling about giving me something free at Bell rock Inn, diamond Resorts. I cut him off, tell him how many phone calls I already received. STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUPID TIME SHARE ANNOYING PLACE! YOU WILL WIND UP WITH NAGGING TELEMARKETERS EVEN AFTER YOU DECLINED THE MAN IN THE FRONT DESK.We were her Christmas Day, this place is located in perfect area, view is wonderful, we don't stay in the room much until night. Bed was comfortable. If we back this area we will returnSo after reading all the bad reviews on this hotel I was a little skeptical booking a room here. We are on  budget right now and felt it was the cheapest way to get out to Sedona so decided to give the place a chance. Glad we did! We have been to Sedona countless times and have stayed at different hotels and resorts each time so we know what is out there. Upon check in we were greeted by a nice courteous clerk named Dora. She was super helpful and informative. She did ask us to stop at concierge for more information. Sure he did ask us to stop at resort for a information seminar and tried to lock us in to setting up appointment. We politely said no thank you and that was that. No biggie. He was polite and not pushy. Gave us some maps of area and tips on things to do that afternoon. We stayed in a king studio looking out toward pool. Room was clean and spacious enough for 2 adults. Room had large TV and kitchenette. Full sized refrigerator and microwave. Even had a stove top burner if you needed to warm something up. Cabinets were stocked with plates and basic cookware. Also room has dishwasher. Didn't use anything but refrigerator and microwave in room is great for room rate. Bed was comfy and I managed to relax and enjoyed my stay. Only complaint was we could hear what sounded like chairs being moved in room above us. It wasn't all night but maybe  in the evening for short period of time. It wasn't enough to ruin our stay. Was this the best hotel with best room I ever been to? No. But I will book there again because I felt it was a nice hotel and room for the value. Staff was great and grounds were lovely. Also there is 2 pools with hot tub. Looking forward to my next visitMy husband and I stayed there last winter and loved it.  We are going back this year!  Our unit was perfect and it sure didn't hurt that we had 75 degree weather!  You do have to be prepared for a sales pitch since this is a timeshare.  We made it clear we were not interested and they did leave us alone.You get what you pay for, and this place is cheap. Stayed in ""upgraded"" 1 bedroom unit, fireplace is a joke (loud fan blows warm air and logs have red tin-foil 'fire'), toilet seat old/dirty (thankful for 2 bathrooms), lobby is lame tacky mural, smells bad, temporary?), but parking was ample and Chasity was uber-helpful during late night ,check-in. No view from most rooms, unless you get a 2 bedroom unit. We did have peekaboo view of some rocks (had a better view of cars parked right outside our windows).Strange 2 floor, 1-bd unit (118) with access from both floors to hallway - one front door had a latch like those found on barnyard stalls. Not confidence inspiring.All-in-all, a disappointing 2.4 stars.This was the best deal on Expedia for the location. After reading all of these reviews I was a little nervous to stay here, but it turned out to be perfect. I took the advice of many and stayed clear of the concierge desk. After checking in the lady told me to go to the concierge desk for maps and info about the area, blah blah blah. No. So I said I would just go to my car first and come back, but I lied. The room itself was amazing, probably the best hotel room I've ever stayed in. There was a kitchenette and it included a medium sized refrigerator/freezer, microwave, coffee maker, sink (soap and sponge included), dish washer (detergent included), pots and pans, cups, everything you need! This was perfect for us because we had food with us and were able to cook our meals here, as well as store food for the rest of our trip. There was even laundry on site that is free, but you have to provide your own detergent. We had one king bed and the sofa pulled out into a bed too. Everything was clean/comfortable, no complaints. It's true though, the room doors slam shut and are a little loud, but nothing to get all mad about. We also used the jacuzzi at night after a long day of hiking and atv riding. Overall, a great stay in Sedona and close to everything. I would definitely stay here again if I come to visit Sedona again!Found this place on Priceline's name your own price for 66.00 dollars! They gave us a townhouse style condo with a full kitchen, 2 baths, sofa bed in the living room and more! Be prepared for the concierge to try to get you to a timeshare presentation, not to pushy though. Definitely would stay here again!Extremely deceptive. Specifically asked for 2 Q beds and were given a K and a couch. For a room advertised as non-smoking and no pets there was an over powering bad odor. The carpets in the hall and the room were stained. The lights in the bedroom did not work. Customer service was awful. They wouldn't listen and were only interested in making a sale - even tried to 'invite' us to a 90 min sales pitch! Avoid this facility at all costs! Do not even want to give 1 star!Nicer than your average hotel. We stayed here for two nights in February after purchasing a Groupon deal. It's close to local shops like Fireside Coffee and just a short drive into Sedona. When we booked our stay all of the studio rooms were full, so we booked a suite. It included nice amenities like two full baths, two televisions (though CRT, not HD), a DVD player, a kitchenette with a two burner stove, larger fridge and even a dishwasher. I liked having a separate living room upstairs with a couch and armchair. The bed was pretty comfortable and the linens were soft. I'm picky about my pillows, but these were great. There were a few downsides to our stay, though. The finishes in the room were sub par - the floorboards didn't meet the flooring, the flooring didn't meet the tubs in the bathrooms. There was this weird noise that we heard periodically, like a humming noise in the AC. The walls are also paper thin - you can hear absolutely everything, from your neighbor's TV to the chatting hotel staff to doors opening and closing through the night. I heard a knock at the door and it wasn't our door. I thought the cleaning staff was upstairs in our suite while we were downstairs in the bedroom but they weren't. You can hear that much, seriously. Also, they have free wifi, but it is  spotty. They do say that if you need a stronger wifi you can come to the lobby. Overall, I'd say that Bell Rock Inn is nicer than a days inn, but it's definitely not the Hilton. If you're looking for a budget friendly getaway in Sedona and won't be spending a lot of time in the hotel, it's a nice option, but I think I'll be looking for other hotels on my next trip to Sedona.Two pools with a great view of bell rock!! All the amenities are super! It feels like home with everything that you need just inside your room. In a quiet part of the town but with  good restaurants just nearby.. And for the price it's worth it!! I've checked other hotels in Sedona and they are much more expensive than this one. Will definitely come backOur room was dirty when we checked in, and it smelled really awful. I called front desk and they moved us to another room right away.Fine for what it is. It is a budget friendly, relatively clean time share/hotel.Pros:Free WiFiFree ParkingPeacefulNice big pools and jacuzziComfortable bedFriendly check in staffCons:Dirty and stained carpets10 am check out ????The cleaning staff that would stand outside of the room yapping and cackling endlessly while cleaning rooms surrounding yours. Horribly annoying while trying to nap.I am not sure that I would opt for this particular hotel when in Sedona next, but it is not a bad place to stay and is decently budget friendly.","We own diamond and stayed here for 4 nights. It was perfect; location, service, accommodations. Request a downstairs room facing the pool. We would stay here again.For a comfortable, clean, quiet suite with nice grounds and facilities, Bell Rock in is a very good deal. We stayed in the shoulder season in late May so the place was not full - that could be a factor to consider. The room had a fireplace, a couch, and a table with two chairs for meals. The kitchen was efficiently equipped and included an electric stovetop, a dishwasher, and a small refrigerator/freezer. We will stay again if we return to Oak Creek and the Sedona area. It is about 8 miles from the middle of Sedona, which might be a negative for some, but the rates compensate for the distance.Worst hotel experience we ever encountered!Pros:The bedding was cleanThe room wasn't terribleCons:The shower head was like a single jet streamShower curtain was dirtyThe fireplace was fakeThe walls are paper thin we could hear 3 doors down Service was terrible the girls at the desk were extremely rude and snottycheck in is at 4:00 pm and check out is at 10:00 amthey charge an extra $100 as a safety depositeverything is out dated All of that was nothing to what we experienced in the morning. I was sleeping and it was around 8:30 am when I was woken up multiple times over a period of 30 minutes of loud banging. I thought it was just because the walls are so thin. Eventually I got up to look out the front door and found to my horror a man's arm reaching around the door trying to unlock the deadbolt. I yelled hello and he said sorry and ran off so I slammed the door. when we went to check out we reported to the lady at the front desk who did nothing about it and didn't even seem shocked. We are still not sure if this was a cleaning person or someone else either way it was horrible. If it was a cleaning person they should have known someone was in there if the deadbolt was on or at least called the room after he had tried to break in for a full 30 minutes.  I just feel very lucky that he was unable to get in.It was just okay. It was clean so you can't go wrong there. The setup was really odd, but hey you're not in Sedona to hang out in your hotel room, right? The bed was comfortable. I like that there was a kitchenette. Two annoyances: a dog in the dog-friendly room barked constantly. The second annoyance: the concierge. Avoid the concierge at all costs. We had been traveling for hours and just wanted to get into our room. After check-in, we were asked to go to the concierge desk where we dealt with a man that was basically a rude salesman and was very passive aggressive when we expressed that we were not interested in buying any vacation packages. Sorry we're not as rich as you had hoped. The guy was a real jerk and it kicked off our stay in Sedona on a bad note. He was very condescending when we shared that we were playing our trip by ear and that we were going about things wrong by not taking his suggestions on where to eat. What a prick. The next morning the lady at the concierge was just as bad, but by then I knew not to waste my time talking to her. Next time we visit Sedona, we will not be staying at Bell Rock Inn. The energy there does not go with the surroundings. The smoking area next to the entrance is pretty off-putting as well. A little weird to not be able to see who may be back there. Especially when it's late at night.Wife and I did a time share presentation with no intent on signing up, got 2 nights free here. Not a bad little place... Room was really nice- HDTV w/ DVD player, full kitchen, regular sized fridge, etc. Made use of Barbeque at pool, watched a few movies at night, had a really nice stay. I'd go back here again if I could get the $29 a night deal they were offering at the time of check in (at The Krazy Coyote).My husband &amp; I went to Sedona with another couple this past weekend and stayed at the Bell Rock Inn after exchanging rooms with a Time Share. It wasn't quite what we expected but was a comfortable place to stay for a long weekend. Our one bedroom 'condo' had a full sized fridge, 2-burner stove, microwave, counterspace, etc. It was great to just go to the store &amp; not have to eat out our entire trip. The bedroom was comfy, &amp; they just got new beds which was great. The TV was small, but watchable. Our room was fairly large compared to what I have been in before. Our friends stayed on the sleeper sofa which wasn't very comfortable &amp; squeaked a lot. In the livng room there was a couch, coffee table, comfy chair, and 4-seater kitchen table. The location was great because we could zip up to Sedona from Oak Creek within 10-15 minutes and do all the things we had planned.I would stay there again for a casual vacation weekend. (Not the Ritz!)Bell Rock Inn is a decent place to stay near Sedona. The view from our room was of one of the pools so we got to watch several grannies doing water aerobics in the morning. Since this is a timeshare type of ""resort"" you have to dodge the lady in the lobby handing out a ""welcome packet"" which is basically an invitation to sit through a presentation on how to buy a timeshare. Our room was in the refurbished section of the hotel and didn't really scream out refurbished. The furniture is still pretty dated but the TV and flooring/countertops look new. The room wasn't as clean as it could have been. I guess I wouldn't stay here again unless I ended up here through Priceline. If I could give 2.5 stars I would.I found this hotel a very confusing place to stay, mostly because you're never sure if it's a hotel or not.It seems to be a timeshare that fobs off spare rooms on hotel guests to maintain occupancy and make a few extra bucks.  The desk staff were pleasant enough, though a little inflexible.The rooms are HUGE and stunningly well appointed.  After all, for a timeshare you'd expect a full size fridge, stove (two burners), and a full complement of kitchen accessories (saucepans, cutlery, crockery).I had an unexpected issue with the bathroom sink, as it was being repaired (engineering, who came to visit just as I got out of the shower, was surprised that they'd rented out the room, but I was in no mood to move all my stuff for the sake of not looking at a wood clamp for the two nights I was here).Given the price of the rooms, and their size, I'll be perfectly happy to overlook the shortcomings and stay here again.We got our stay at Bell Rock Inn through a Timeshare Exchange.  I chose this because of the kitchen facilities.From the outside, its apparent the facility is a little older, and I was concerned about the quality of the accommodations. (They were great, more to follow.)The Lobby was worn and outdated, but clean.  Staff was friendly, and the lady manning the front desk couldn't have been better.  She was kind, efficient, and helpful.  The concierge of course had a timeshare sales pitch, but that's to be expected.  She did provide the information I needed, but I wasn't impressed by the stained shirt and visible panties. (Over the top of her pants.)  All other staff we encountered were very friendly and professional.The halls were a little outdated, with slightly tacky Southwestern art. With the adobe-style outside, it was almost expected. Our room definitely exceeded my expectations.  It was very clean. The king-size bed had crisp white, modern linens.  The appliances were obviously new, and very clean.  I was pleased to find the basic items, as well as some useful extras-like a corkscrew and a whisk.  :) The pull out sleeper sofa was more comfortable than expected.  We had plenty of towels, and they were very nice-fluffy!  Loved the pull out flat screen that we could rotate towards the bed or seating area.Our room was in a great location, and we were maybe a 10 second walk from the ""adult"" pool.  It was clean, with plenty of seating.  Lots of umbrella tables, loungers, and regular chairs.  The pool was large, and the hot tub was nice as well.  Sitting in there and gazing at the red rock  formations was unbeatable!The Bell Rock Inn is a very short drive from hiking, shopping, Uptown Sedona, dining, etc.  Its partway between Oak Creek and Sedona.  I enjoyed the fact that it was away from the uber-tourism of Sedona Proper.  Not luxurious, but definitely nice.I'd book here again without any hesitation.We went to Sedona to get Married last month. We found a Groupon for the Bell Rock Inn that we used during our stay so it was a decent price. We also brought some family and friends that stayed at the hotel as well. When I booked the room I mentioned to the reservationist that we were getting married during our stay. She was excited about it and mentioned that the hotel would be doing something special for us. I also mentioned it again when we were checking in. Big surprise.... Nothing was done for us. I wasn't even going to mention it because I don't like doing that but everyone told us you have to tell them over and over. It really wouldn't have been a big deal if we weren't told something was going to be done. We could have at least been given a renovated room like the REST of our wedding party did. I think we had the worst room out of everybody. I received a survey from the hotel a week or so after our stay. I mentioned all of this in the survey and have yet to hear back from them. They mentioned how committed they are to guest satisfaction but apparently that is just a crock. They could have at least replied.My wife and I scheduled a 2 night stay on a Diamond Promotion for our 41st anniversary 12/26-28. We are silver Diamond owners and have stayed in some lovely places including Summit and Ridge in Sedona. The Bell Rock Inn is the worst Diamond property we have stayed in in our 5 years of ownership. The only good quality was the excellentDiamond"" standard bed. It was fantastic. But linoleum floors, you've got to be kidding. I was told all the rooms have linoleum except for pet rooms that have some carpet? Seems to me it should be pet rooms that have linoleum and non-pet rooms carpet.So, fortunately we were only 2 hours from home, so after 1 night, back to  Phoenix we went. This property needs substantial upgrade to be on the scale of Diamond International Resorts. We will not stay again and recommend it only for the traveler looking for a very basic accommodation in Sedona.Stayed here as part of our timeshare.  In their defense, we brought our dog and although the dog rooms were recently refurbished, they were still dog rooms. The refurbishment wasn't as complete as I would have liked. Parchment paper was still taped to many items in the unit, and the efficiency kitchen, although only missing a stove, was positioned next to the door so the door kept slamming into the dishwasher, the cabinet doors and the refrigerator. The view from the parking lot was beautiful. The view from our patio, not so much. The gorgeous Sedona Rocks were blocked by a storage trailer. The workout room consisted of two machines. Moy, the concierge, knew nothing of the dog-related activities and shopping in the area, but was very good at the hard-sell component of her job. All in all I was unimpressed, but plan to give them another chance in the future.The room we got was really old with no updating whatsoever. The TV had really bad reception. Maybe if we had paid more we would have gotten a better room I don't know. Great location. Would maybe stay there again if I got a room that looked nice like in the pictures online.I kinda have a love/hate relationship with this place.  My daughter and I went up to Sedona on a whim- I got a smoking deal with this place using Priceline Negotiator.  It's about 10 minutes outside of where the main strip of Sedona is.  It's not much too look at from the outside, but definitely not bad, and definitely clean.  We really enjoyed the room, kitchenette, view, etc.  I'd probably give it four stars if it wasn't for the uh, slightly unusual experience.  When we went to check in, they didn't have record of our reservation.  To be fair, this could be an error with priceline.  However, we waited about fifteen minutes to confirm everything until we were given our keys.  They also pre-authorize a card for $100 in case of incidentals, which is fine, but I'll get to later.  It was a little frustrating getting into the room, but once we did, we were happy.  Until- we went down to the pool and got locked out of our room at 11pm.  I didn't get the key wet, have it close to magnets, etc (they said that could wipe its memory). So, we go to the lobby soaking wet.  Four people are there checking in, same party.  We waited half an hour (the key here being in towels and WET) to get our key programmed.  Whatever, not that big of a deal.  However, the next day, I got locked out AGAIN. Thankfully, my daughter was in the room.  I go to check out- they don't have record that I paid and try to charge me.  After waiting another fifteen minutes and showing a copy of the receipt AGAIN- they let me leave.  I am curious, however, to see if my credit card they kept for incidentals gets a charge.  If so, I'll amend the review.Bottom line- the place was clean and presentable, but the service ruined it.  I would have definitely stayed there again, but not sure now. PS Give the maid a raise.Ahhhhhhhhhh Sedona :)One of the most beautiful and tranquil places I've ever been to. It's high desert and it's red rock land and if you are into any type of soul searching or practice meditation of any kind, this will be your golden ticket into that realm.Every time I've made the journey here, we've stayed at the Bell Rock Inn for a number of reasons. The first and best is...it's cheap. And if you get a room facing Bell Rock (which is a giant vortex that looks a lot like a...you guessed it Bell) you will be stoked at what you are paying and the view you are getting. They also have a really good little restaurant here that makes a killer Eggs Benedict.The rooms aren't posh by any means, but you are in Sedona to see the natural surroundings, to hike, to take Jeep tours if you wish to, not sit in the room. There are great spas around, but for the most cost effective way to spend a few days in Sedona, this is the way to go.As a personal tip, the best time to hit Sedona is in the Spring as the snow is melting. You then get the amazing little creeks and it's just sooo beautiful!My husband and I belong to Diamond Resorts.  I was a little hesitant to reserve a unit at Bell Rock Inn because it looked older than our usual Sedona resort called Sedona Summit.  We were not disappointed at all.  We had a two story, one bedroom unit; it reminded me of our Lake Tahoe cabin, complete with a fireplace and wood beamed ceilings.Everyone I met at the pool were friendly and having a good time.My two suggestions for improvement include replacing the worn hallway carpets and get rid of the cockroaches.This is a place to trade timeshares and a regular hotel, so it seems a cut above a regular hotel.  It has two big outdoor pools and an outdoor whirlpool.  The housekeeping staff doesn't speak English, so if they knock and you need to vacate your room while they clean, they don't understand ""come back in 5 minutes"".  I waited at the pool all morning for them to come back!  Location wise, it is within walking distance of some good restaurants if you don't want to drive into Sedona.  Particularly Tara Thai and Marie's (mexican).  Beware of the concierge, she will try to convince you to sit through a two-hour spiel on timeshare ownership in exchange for a reduced rate on a pink jeep tour.We bought (2) groupons in order to stay 4 nights at Bell Rock, which is located about 15-20 minutes from Sedona, (although it is within Sedona city limits so it is considered a part of Sedona). Decent price per night with the Groupon (I cannot imagine staying at this timeshare for the full price of $149/night but at 1/2 that per night is a deal!). It is not your fanciest of places but since we were staying in our rooms the entire time, it was good enough for our needs. GOOD- Decent price with Groupon- Free DSL!!!!- Kitchenette (our room didn't have a full separate kitchen but it did have a full size refrigerator, electric stove top, coffee maker, toaster, small microwave, and plenty of counter and cabinets).- Towels were provided for use at the swimming pools (don't take them or you will be charge $25 per towel!)- King size bed (clean linens, plenty of pillows, pretty cushy)- Front desk people were friendly and helpful- If you need anything (extra towels, light bulbs, toilet paper), they bring it to you within 10 minutes or less!- Spa/Jacuzzi was perfectly heated- BBQ and gazebo area for families to cook their own food- Fitness room available (didn't get a chance to check it out but good to know that there is one available)- Fake Fireplace :)- Accomodated our request for a second floor room- Convenient location near gas stations, some local shopping (GAP outlet!), cafes/restaurantsBAD- You have to make reservations through their main site (Diamond International Resorts) and the wait can be long to talk to an operator. If you call the front desk directly, they will not help you make a reservation.- Small bathtub/shower combo (just like the ones in an apartment complex)- Small bathroom sink (would be nice to have double sink area)- Couch was a bit lumpy- TV was a flat panel mounted on the wall but it had a swivel neck so you would have to turn it in the direction you wanted to view it (thus, people who were laying in bed and people who were sitting on the couch)- Cold, tile floors throughout room- Concierge would not assist us with our questions about tours until after we checked in at the front desk on the first day we arrived. While I waited in line, I had asked my hubby to ask the concierge about GC tours and she said she preferred for us to check in first and then she would help us. She was not helping anyone else at the time but of course, by the time we finished with our check-in, she was helping someone else. We didn't want to wait since we had just driven 8 hours and were beat tired. She called later that night and wanted to arrange a 9am appt. with us but we politely declined (heck she brushed us off so screw her!).- The shower made a really obnoxious bull-horn noise whenever we used the shower head and the walls are pretty thin that I could hear the people in the room next to us taking a shower!- The main pool was small and is supposedly heated but it was still cold (although the kids didn't mind going in it)- Early check-out (10am)- No elevators (we lugged heavy luggage up and down to our 2nd floor room) but they did offer to have hotel staff help us with the luggage- The nearest major supermarket (Safeway) is in the heart of Sedona, about 20-25 minutes awayOverall, we would stay here again if we got the same Groupon deal since it was pretty decent living conditions with (for the most part) friendly staff. I would not stay here again if I had to spend more than $100 per night.Great place to stay, kitchen had everything we needed.  The bed was very comfortable and it was nice to have a heated pool and spa to use.  I liked that they are ""green"" and have recycle bins all over, including in the room.I am staying here thru my timeshare, The check in staff was friendly but then they send you over to the concierge for info, I was thinking she would tell me places to see,, no she starts questioning me on who is with me when I said I have a 18 yr old and a 11 yr old she said are they you kids, yes(why is that her business) she then says is that all that is with you? I said yes she then asked me if I am the one that owns my timeshare I said yes and then she said do you own it with your husband? I said yes.  then she said is your husband not with you(why is this her business??) I said no. she said well is he going to come up? I know I gave her a a look of surprise, I said I don't know, she said your not sure?? now I am getting mad, I said if he can get a way from work maybe I am here to enjoy myself with my kids. I know I said it rudely as I am thinking why is this any of her business.. then she said well we wanted to have you come to a timeshare presentation but your husband has to be with you. ooh now all the questions make sense.. but still none of it was her business why didn't she just say would you like to take a timeshare presentation.. I am also bugged that they make you go to her to go thru this. I have never had another time share put me thru this to stay there!!!The room is a 2nd floor studio, not what I thought I was getting. no patio, it is big for studio size and works ok for us, the issue I have it the low flow toilets that hardly handles anything and we have had to have them plunge twice.. the guy says you can hardly use any toilet paper in the toilet, so you have to flush more often and hope it goes down which have the time it doesn't so you have to flush agian,,so where are we saving on water.. the shower is a low flow shower but very loud and comes out really hard,, it does save on water as you want to get out of the shower as soon as possible.The front desk staff at night is 2 young girls that have a attitude and should remember that they are there to help the guest and be happy to have a job and not act like you are bugging them if you ask for something.. we were scheduled for a mid week cleaning, well all they did was make the bed and give us more towels, the place has linoleum floors which they didn't sweep or clean the bathroom.. very disappointing.I will not stay here again did not live up to my timeshare expectations at all!!!","Great views of the Oak Creek traffic.. cars nonstop! Don't come here if you want silence. Ugly lobby. Slow maids check in was 4 but room wasn't ready.. we even called at around 1 o clock to let them know we were getting to Oak Creek early and to see if we could possibly check in early.. the girl was nice and said she'd see what she could do and call back at 2:30. So we just pulled in at 2:30 thinking that since we called they would jump on cleaning our room and have it ready for us but nope instead the lady wanted to let me know that the maids have until 4 and your room is not ready....... If you have a guest arriving early I would think you would want to take care of us.. I mean if they wanted us to come back here... The lady said she'd call my cell when they got the room ready. So I bit my toung and sat in the car with the a/c on so my grocerys didn't spoil until about 4:05 I went into the lobby again AT CHECK IN TIME because I never recieved a phone call, only to find out it would be another 15 minutes! Wow is all I could say at this point.. I could've said much worse but I'm too polite.... The rooms are nice but they face the wrong direction.. the street??? and early check out 10 am! Crazy. I'm going to take the extra 20 minutes I waited for my room (with parishable grocerys and in the rain) and check out at 10:20. Thank you very much..My family and I were treated terribly by the manager at the Bell Rock Inn.  We arrived after an 8 hr. car ride and it was around 100 degrees outside and our room was almost 90 degrees.  The manager told us the air conditioner had probably got turned down too low and froze the unit.  He assured us that if we waited an hr., it would thaw out and the air would turn on.  We continued with this charade for the next few hrs. and we were exhausted and just wanted to unpack our things and relax.   We kept asking for another room and when he finally agreed, I walked into a room with people in it!!!!!  I was horrified and the manager barely blinked an eye.  We had our 2 young children with us, it was getting late,  and we were getting quite flustered by this point. He finally put us in another room which he said would be an upgrade and it was a nicer room, although it only had one bathroom.  The next morning I get up, unpack (we were staying for a week), and then we receive a phone call from Mr. Manager saying we had to move rooms again.   I was livid by this point and I would have never  unpacked our belongings if I thought we would have to move again.  At no point did he say the previous night that the upgrade would only be for the night.  I went to the office to tell him I wasn't moving, he was rude and unprofessional and made me feel like the other guests were more important than us.  We ended up keeping our room but I would never stay there again and would never recommend anyone else to stay there.This place isn't anything fancy but the grounds are well kept, the staff is very friendly and helpful, and the location is great (walking distance to Bell Rock and some decent places to eat.)  I loved having a small kitchen in our room, it's nice not to eat every meal out.  We stayed in a dog friendly room so our room smelled of dogs, but the upside is that they separate the rooms that pets are allowed in so if you stay in a non-pet friendly room it should smell fine. Our AC didn't work very well - it won't let you set the temp lower than 70 and we had to run ours nonstop on 70 just to try to keep it cool.  The pet fee doesn't make a lot of sense because it's $20 per pet per day, but they don't clean your room every day - usually the fee is associated with some kind of required cleaning.  However, we got a great deal and for about the same price we would have paid next door at La Quinta we got a room with a kitchen and sofa bed, so if we find ourselves traveling with pets through Sedona again we will certainly consider Bell Rock Inn.",,"['place', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'girlfriend', 'took', 'last', 'minute', 'road', 'trip', 'booked', 'room', 'weeknight', 'way', 'less',
