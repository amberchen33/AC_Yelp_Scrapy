http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-barksdale-house-inn-charleston,The Barksdale House Inn,3.5,$$,20,"Great bed and breakfast. We stayed in the 1st floor king suite. Amazing location just one block from kings. The room and staff were impeccable. Parking was easy. The breakfast was very nice. You can get snacks, coffee, or tea around the clock. The included wifi was more than adequate. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 was that it can be a bit noisy from the street and from people walking in this older house and from above. Little bit of a creaky house thing going on. So I would suggest staying on the second floor. Also, the breakfast was good for me (who is not a huge breakfast guy) and consists of cereal, fruit, breads and pastries, and a couple of rotating items like ham croissants one day and grits and an egg biscuit bake the other. Be aware that this isn't a huge eggs and bacon type of breakfast some people may be expecting with a B&amp;B.Highly recommended place to stay and dogs are welcome.The location is perfect. But, my husband and I stayed in room 1 and there was a street light in the window that was shining through all night.  They need curtains. we are pretty rough today from lack of sleep.Also, we ended up paying more than what we were quoted when we made the reservation. We also stayed at King George across the street this weekend, it was much better.We stayed here for a few days while in Charleston on vacation. For the relatively low price, it is good. Friendly staff, great location. The free parking is a huge bonus.Don't expect a real breakfast.  Apparently that only happens on the weekends, when staying here is more expensive. That doesn't bother me because there is so much good food in Charleston.  There is real coffee (not hotel junk) that the wife says is delicious.   This is an historic hotel near college of Charleston built in 1787 I think.  The floors may well be original.  I would advise not walking on them in socks because they are crazy slippery.  The room is nice and clean.  The cleaning staff is efficient.  My complaints are 1) the heat doesn't really work and 2) there is a hot tub where there should be a regular shower.  We were here when it was cold (for here) and the heater basically blew cold air.  The thermostat said it was 70, but it clearly was not.  This same failure occurs at my office building where cold air blows on us all and the management company claims that the thermostat says 68 so there isn't a problem.  Right...The shower is a problem.  A hot tub should never be combined with a shower.  If you are going to have. Shot tub, it needs to be a stand alone unit.  This isn't a 5 star spa/hotel and a hot tub is unnecessary.  Worse, it interferes with taking a shower because it makes getting in and out more difficult than it normally would be. I'm not 100 years old, but it is some effort to step into an empty hot tub because the idiot who installed it did not make it flush with the floor as a hot tub should be but instead basically dropped it on the floor and caulked it in where it sat. This is an issue the hotel should address with the contractor.  The wife comments that the hotel has soft towels, which she says is unusual.  The staff is not wasteful she  says, meaning that the shampoo and conditioner does not get thrown out and replaced every day.Great location and super cute Charleston inn!  We stayed in the carriage house and the room was very nice and clean.  My only complaint would be the beds were not the most comfortable but they were horrible either.  Quaint and charming with a friendly and helpful staff. They put out cookies every night, which was a nice treat!  Highly recommended for a nice Charleston visit!Very pretty house inside and out. The location is pretty good except for the very loud late night college crowd.Quaint little inn on a quiet side street with enough parking to accommodate one car per room (there are only 14 rooms). The staff is very friendly and helpful. Keep in mind that this is a very old home, all original hardwood floors, so you can pretty much hear every move that is made in upstairs and adjacent rooms. Bedding and towels are very clean. The bathroom in my room needs some serious updating though. The ceiling has been patched a hundred times and there's a rotting old trap door up there that frightens me a bit. But if you're in Charleston and don't plan on spending a lot of time in your room, it's sufficient, clean, and charming. Daily breakfast is served (yay, hard boiled eggs! Happiness!), afternoon tea, sherry, and cheese/crackers every day from 4-5, and my favorite thing...the baking of the cookies around 7:30pm...the smell is divine. These are left out for guests overnight alongside a pitcher of ice water. Midnight snack ready. Very close to amazing restaurants and tons of shopping!A nice little B&amp;B that is in a quiet neighborhood near the College of Charleston. It is one block over from King Street (think shopping) and a short walk from the market and East Bay St (think dining/drinking/waterfront) The staff was very helpful and friendly, although I did overhear a few snotty conversations between staff members about each other. However, when they interacted with guests everyone was completely pleasant. The breakfast was good even the coffee (which is hard for me to say good coffee since I tend to be a ""coffee snob""). The rooms were spacious and comfortable. There is cable and WiFi available, and while I do not go on vacation to watch TV the actual TV sets are the size of my computer monitor (21"").The place does need a little renovation. Ceilings were cracking, large holes in the guttering, &amp; peeling wallpaper,.I can put up with this because of the location that is far enough away from East Bay street to be lots cheaper than the average B&amp;B closer to the battery. A nice choice in downtown Charleston.Such a great place to stay. Location is perfect, walking distance from everything - right on top of King's for shopping, around the corner from Market, a hop skip and a jump from the battery.The charm of the house is matched by the charm of the service. Breakfast on the back porch near the courtyard was intimate, delicious, and a great start to a beautiful day.The room rate is a little pricey, but worth it for the unique atmosphere and complimentary tea time and breakfast.The only thing keeping this from a 5 is the antique beds, which though beautiful, are a little noisy for a romantic weekend in an old home with paper thin walls. Just a heads up :)We have stayed here a few times and it is a nicely restored Inn in a convenient location. You can park here which is a plus. You can walk from here to all the downtown areas.Ebony was nice enough at the check-in. Poor girl is sitting there trying to learn the job it seemed while Leeanne comes over and embarrasses her with quick responses as if she's a moron. Then Leanne was cool enough later to be moody again for my wife asking for ice. I don't like Leeanne. The place is cramped as usual B&amp;Bs, but very pretty. Ugh, why do I always pick B&amp;Bs?! #canIdoThis #isThisAllowedEbony was cool the whole time.This past November, my family and I visited Charleston just before Thanksgiving, and settled on the Barksdale House Inn as an off the beaten path, quiet place to stay.  Located in a generally quiet neighborhood near the College of Charleston, the Barksdale House is a bit off the beaten path, while still within an easy walk to Market and King Streets as well as the waterfront.The house itself well decorated, and maintains its' historical air while still being modern in its' amenities.  There are actually two buildings; the front house and then a back, newer building.  The main house only has a small common space, however the staff make the dining area and kitchen available to guests as needed, which was a nice touch.  Our rooms had gas fireplaces, and  comfortable beds which set the mood in the spacious rooms for a feel of ""Old Charleston"".Weekend breakfasts were buffet style, and consisted of some traditional hot entrees like Scrambled Eggs or Potato Cakes, along with fresh fruit and pasteries.  During the weekdays they served a cold continental breakfast.  While filling and of a good variety, we found it to be a bit lacking for a Bed and ""Breakfast"".  The staff during our stay were all quite pleasant, and had good recommendations for  things to do or places to visit in the area.  The staff we interacted with were students at the College,  and more than accommodating for our requests.  We were even able to arrive early in the morning and leave our luggage until check-in on the day of our arrival as well as  leave our luggage again until the evening of the day of our departure, which was a nice touch.Overall a great quiet place to stay in Charleston.My girlfriend and I stayed for two nights in room 8 and I've never been more satisfied. The breakfasts were great and free breakfast in bed is worth the entire stay. I would recommend this to anyone who is tired if staying in hotels that all Look and feel te same. And with a 1 minute walk from the best shopping in the south my girlfriend was extremely happy. Will be back again.The Inn is in a great location and has free parking, all a plus. While our room was big and comfy we didn't have any towels upon arrival. We had to ask for them and didn't even get a full set. Breakfast is...really blah. If we had to do it all over again we'd skip breakfast and go to a cafe. The services was 50/50. During the day there was the sweetest lady who really tried to make everything great. The evening shift girl was extremely unfriendly and very clearly did not want to be there.  Although the Inn is not a 5 starer I would stay here again.Very nice place. Perfect location -walk to shops, food n etc. Charming and clean, quiet, updated electric n plumbing, good array at bkfst .  good staff but no staff after 8 pm - part of a chain of bnb's.I stayed at Barksdale with my mom and our Toy Poodle after Christmas. We both had time off work and decided to take a trip to Charleston for a couple of days. We chose Barksdale because it was dog-friendly and in the center of town. It was clean, our room spacious, had parking, and most importantly within walking distance to everything. We drove to dinner one night because it was chilly out, but otherwise we walked everywhere with our pup. The staff was friendly. They have a small breakfast in the morning and some tea/snacks around 4. We chose to eat out one day and caught the weekend breakfast before we left. We're pretty independent and didn't hang around the b&amp;b much, but if you just need a place that you'll feel comfortable keeping your dog and close to the action this did the job.I love this place and will stay again.  We stayed the week prior to Thanksgiving and had our dog in tow.  We were concerned about the reviews of the staff initially but needed a place that would accommodate our dog.  The staff was incredible. Wesley checked us in the first evening and made us feel at home immediately. Room was clean, well maintained - it is an old house so prepare for old house charm - we had a creeky spot in our floor. I tried to avoid it for the sake of the people staying in the room below.  Water pressure in the shower was fantastic and the water was very hot. Bed was super comfy. Breakfast on the weekend, was mini omelets (containing meat), pancakes, muffins, fruit and cereal. Coffee/tea as well. It is served in the main house complete with roaring fire. The only downside I see is if you are in one of the rooms at the front of the house. You may hear breakfast noise in these rooms if you're not an early riser. The breakfast atmosphere is great for chatting with the staff/guests to exchange dining or touring advice. The location is a block and a half off King st, the shopping and dining area in the city. Couldn't be better!Good location and free parking. BUT! DON'T STAY HERE! We had a two night stay here. While we were out enjoying Charleston a pair of my valuable and sentimental earrings given as an anniversary gift were stolen from our room!!! The theft was reported to management of the Barksdale but they were very ambivalant about it. Reminded us of the ""waiver"" we signed, blah, blah, blah. We had not expected a whole lot, but this was unforgiveable. Of all our third world travels, nothing like this has ever happended. A perfect get-away weekend spoiled. So you don't take valuables....then think about the hair found on the sheets, the not so clean bathrooms,no tissue, etc. etc. rather worn and forelorn, and staff with apparant sticky fingers! DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU! a fine city with plenty of options. This shouldn't be one of them!The good:Free parking.  Location was great, just steps from King Street which is full of shopping and restaurants, and only about a 20 min walk to the Battery, Rainbow Row, etc.  Room (we stayed in Room 9 I believe, on the third floor with two beds) was very clean, and it had its own thermostat which was nice.  Hot breakfast on the weekends, and it was delicious.The bad:Unlike most bed and breakfasts, the only common area is a room which has a desk/office set up in half of it for the employees, and the other half is where the breakfast buffet goes.  There are metal tables w/ tablecloths in the hallway and outside on the porch for you to eat at.  The porch itself is serviceable but kind of dirty with dead bugs and trash bins taking up one end.  There is no real place to sit and relax, other than the tables in the hallway or porch- so the only place to relax really is your room.  Most bed and breakfasts I've stayed in have a big comfy living room for you to relax in, as well as a nice dining area- rather than have that, they chose to fit in as many rooms as they absolutely could.  During breakfast, the employees kept up a constant stream of complaints to each other- it's a little hard to enjoy breakfast when you are stuck listening to employees complain to each other about the guests, having to do check in/check out of guests, complaints about their personal lives, complaints about other employees not getting there on time, etc etc.  Highly unprofessional, and the number one rule in customer service is don't complain about the customers in front of them.  The bottom line is that the Inn is definitely serviceable, but you feel like you are in a ""bargain"" Bed and Breakfast, even though the price might not reflect it.  If you are looking for a romantic B &amp; B experience, and a beautiful place to stay, go elsewhere.  If you basically want a clean place to sleep, in a decent location with free parking, this place is great.Okay, the inn was nice, but I thought the breakfast on Saturday could have been better.  Big fan of their parking area, which means you don't have to pay to park at this inn like some other in Charleston.The location was good, the parking was free, the nightly rate was inexpensive.  The bed linens were obviously clean, but the rest of the room I am not so sure about.  There was a tissue box with 1 dirty tissue in it and a dead bug in the corner upon our arrival.  While terrified of bugs, I do understand that this is the South and so I gave the benefit of the doubt and just thought it got missed.  We received a phone call after our first night asking if we wanted housekeeping services.  I typically would say no, but since the room was not adequately cleaned prior to our arrival we said yes.  It was not cleaned even still.  No one stepped foot inside.  Our first morning brunch was good because we went to Blossom Restaurant.  We decided to enjoy our inn and sample breakfast the next day which was yogurt and waffles that you had to toast and sit in a hallway to eat.  The staff was nice, but didn't go out of their way to welcome you.  The bed while clean, was extremely uncomfortable.  Charleston was just lovely and while this experience did not ruin our travel through town, it certainly didn't add to it.  During this trip we stayed in 5 cities, and we've traveled a decent bit in the past, so I feel confident in my review.  Knowing what I know now, I would not stay at this Inn again.  Charleston is a very walkable city, so location, free parking, and a cheap rate don't outweigh the negatives for us.  I guess my biggest issue is that the website described luxury including turndown service, which we did not witness.  Our review may be limited since we only stayed 2 nights, but I honestly wouldn't have stuck around for a third to gamble.",,,,,"['great', 'bed', 'breakfast', '1st', 'floor', 'king', 'suite',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-charleston-airport-coliseum-n-charleston,Hampton Inn Charleston-Airport/Coliseum,2.5,$$,19,"Stayed here on our arrival night in Charleston. Landed at midnight, headed over, checked in, slept, left, and had no issues.So it's been a week since my stay here and I'm still mad about it. I booked a room through Priceline out of necessity because my flight was getting in too late to drive where I needed to go that night. After multiple delays, I finally got to charleston after 230am and just wanted to crash in my room. Too much to ask, apparently. Upon waiting to check in, there was a couple at the desk ahead of me complaining that they had just checked in to find their room was used and not cleaned. This was a bad sign of the fate that awaited me. After I checked in and walked into my room, a cloud of smoke greeted me and the entire room smelled like an ashtray. I had confirmation from my booking that I was in a non-smoking room. (Sidenote: this is 2015. Are companies still concerned with catering to their smoking customers?? You can't smoke anywhere else, why still have smoking rooms? Yuck.) So as the clock rounded 330am, back downstairs I marched to tell the uncaring gentleman at the front desk named Michael that my room was smoking and should be non, to which he replied with the happy news that it was the only room that was available and I had no choice but to sleep in it. He also told me that booking through a third party site didn't guarantee the type of room I would get. As if this was my fault and should have known that?After weighing my lack of other options, I accepted my fate of sleeping in the death stick cloud for the few hours I was going to get. Michael then offered to refund my money for the incident (I was surprised to learn he was the manager) and mentioned I just needed to sign something when checking out. So the time came for me to check out, and shocker: the girl at the front desk had no notes or information about what happened or a refund for the room charge. She took my number and told me someone would call me to get it worked out. Surprise, no one has called. I waited a week to see if the charge would fall off. Nope. So now I have to do the legwork with the hotel and my credit card to get a refund for what was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. If this was a Motel 6, I'd expect this kind of thing and let it go. But not for a room that was over $100/night. Believe my and the other reviews and do not stay here.Smallish and older with a dated feel. It ran a distant second to the spiffy Hampton at Broadway Myrtle Beach.Our small room felt quite crowded with a desk,  tv cabinet, couch, bed, etc.Our door stuck, needing either a tug to open or a hip-check to close.Free parking. So-so wi-fi. Unipressive location behind a Waffle House.OK breakfast in small lobby dining room,Friend and polite staff. Always have coffee and tea available in the lobby. Nice little gym. Breakfast from 6-10 AM. Free wifi. Comfortable beds and pillows, very clean. I will definitely be coming to stay here again. Van driver very friendly.We was not offered another room. So we just went to CVS to get a candle and air freshener. For the price I would not recommend this hotel unless it is your last option. The restaurants made this trip great. We did a lot of walking so made sure u have some good shoes.We don't expect much but quietness to be able to rest at night, clean bathroom and comfortable bed to sleep in. This hotel offers all three. Complimentary wi-fi and breakfast certainly help too.For $140 a night they get one star. This place is dirty and gross. I would have gone to the front desk and checked out and go to a better hotel but I have a flight to catch in 5 hours..Between a 2 and 3 - I'll go with 3 because of the good staff; most of the hotels shortfalls are not their fault.  Our first room had a issue, the staff got right on it and moved us to another room.  The new room was better but...toilet ran - aggregating.  Rest of hotel is old - stained hallway carpets.  This does not represent the Hampton (or Hilton) brand very well.Not your typical Hampton Inn.I travel to Charleston pretty regularly with work, and while I usually choose Hilton brands, I had yet to stay at this particular site. It's okay, but there a couple issues I have. They did let me check-in early, so I appreciated that. The front desk was friendly as well. But aside from those to high-points and the great breakfast, the rooms were just okay. No microwave or fridge which is a pain, and the amenities are pretty bare.In the end, it's a hotel that I stay in while on business. That being said, I'll probably head back over to Mt. Pleasant next time. This just wasn't great.Nice place but housekeeping is inconsistent.  Had to call two out of three days just to get the in room coffee refreshed, its like they ignored that part of the room which annoys me as it is 7am now and i don't have any coffee in my room.  No apologies , just frustration from the front desk when i call.First night it took three trips to the lobby to get a working set of keys.  New girl at the desk finally sent up maintenance, who radioed her back and said 'i don't know - my key worked' and i said 'i told you i knowhow to work a key' - and she returns with 'yeah but he is using your key'.  She wound up giving me another room but making me feel like an idiot. (Maintenance man had used his key for the first room, not the third wrong set she gave us)Unfortunately I chose this hotel chain because of past experience,  but, this is the worst stay that I have ever had at a Hampton Inn,  from the beginning it was a disaster,  from not being able to get a taxi to the hotel,  to waiting 2 hours for food delivery,  to a non working remote that took three trips to front desk to resolve,  and now breakfast is not even ready when they advertise it being ready  at 5:30am, it's now 6:49 am and it's still not ready, really, don't come here run as quickly as you can. I give it minus one star.  Oh yeah, it's smells and not the cleanest bring Clorex wipes.Room not ready when arrived late afternoon. Booked 3 months in advance. Staff did not care. One star due to service at this price.How do you know that your hotel is disgusting. When you have to ask the front desk for Clorox wipes to clean the pubic hair and urine from the toilet seat.  Unfortunately, I had to ask three times to switch rooms and the one with the pubic hairs was the cleanest one.  I can go on but my recommendation is to go elsewhere.  The entire City was sold out this weekend or I would have left immediately.This is a pretty average Hampton Inn location.  The staff is very friendly, the room is clean and comfortable.  They don't have a business center per se, just a couple of computers in the lobby that are ancient and slow.  The wi-fi was pretty good.  Convenient location near the airport and lots of restaurant options nearby (of the chain variety.)Friendly southern hospitality. Clean, comfortable,  great service and reasonably priced.Evening Reception during the week, breakfast to go during the day.  Friendly staffThe grouchy, older front desk lady did not like us at all. I have no idea what we did to her, but she was just so rude.It is near the airport and they provide free shuttle service. It is a bit outdated, but the staff and breakfast were good.",,,,,"['arrival', 'night', 'landed', 'midnight', 'headed', 'checked', 'slept', 'left', 'issues', 'week', 'since', 'still', 'mad', 'booked',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-charleston-mount-pleasant-mount-pleasant-2,Holiday Inn Charleston - Mount Pleasant,3.0,$$,19,"Nice, clean hotel with a friendly staff. Beautifully decorated for Christmas. Would recommendI have been an IHG Gold member for over 10 years. When I travel I always stay at an IHG or SPG hotel. I came here because of the proximity to the amount Pleasant Pier, and area. I reserved a room with a refrigerator and a microwave. I arrived to a room WITHOUT either. Because I came here specifically to see my son, and not on ""vacation"" or ""business,"" it is imperative that a 10 hour, 620 mile trip is as economically efficient as possible. (Money spent should be on my child, not the place we stay).Not only do I get a room without a fridge or microwave, the hotel cannot and will not accommodate me by bringing one to my room. I have stayed in many hotels. I have paid for Internet, for a fridge, and for a microwave. I can't even pay extra here because these people are apparently retarded.Finally! We fished on the pier, have fish and went to the nearby Whole Foods to get a dinner to grill. I can't grill my food on the property.As much as I have patronized IHG hotels in the past, one would think I could use a portable grill. I WILL NOT come back to this hotel. My son is 12. And in the school months I come to him. This is my first and LAST time at this Holiday Inn.Very clean, very helpful staff.  We went on a local government discount and received breakfast for free; the buffet was very filling, the service was OK.  The evening bartenders were very helpful with tips and advice about local eateries, they prepared us for a wait at the restaurant we were going to go to so we had a plan B in place.  Super convenient to downtown.Really good hotel here. I thought this Holiday Inn will be ghetto, small, etc. I was wrong. The view from outside is better decent. You can already tell that it's a little upscale. Apparently all the rooms doesn't have a mini fridge unless you ask which I did but it didn't come with a microwave. I've been to worst hotels and they had a mini fridge AND a microwave. But whatever I didn't trip so much about that.The front desk is very professional and polite. We went in and out of the hotel and was greeted every time.High speed interest? Nope we were on the highest floor which is the 5th and the Internet was slow.I'm surprised none of the other reviews mention the noise.All the doors in this hotel slam shut.  I mean SLAM.  For a few bucks they could fix this with rubber doo-dads on the jam.  But no, it's random SLAM as you are trying to sleep.There was a truck in the parking lot outside my window every morning that must have been doing laps in reverse.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep for 15 minutes every morning at 6:00 a.m.  The mini fridge sounded like an idling mack truck in the room, but at least I was able to turn in off, unlike the morning symphony of door slamming as folks started leaving their rooms, a few hours after the last door slam of the returning night owls.Don't expect quiet here.Housekeeping took the nearly full shampoo container out of the shower, but did not leave me a new one.  They also threw out bars of soap that I had only used once.  Wasteful.  The lighting in the room was weird.  There are two light switches at the door when you enter.  A ""master"" switch (which does not control the light next to the bed) and another switch for some of the other lights.  Really odd.  Why do that?  No one has that in their home.  Really confusing every time I entered the room.The breakfast spread was huge and offered at no additional charge.  I was very impressed by the variety.Our stay seemed to start off well. Room had a fridge and maybe a little dated but seemed clean.  Unfortunately as we were getting ready to leave which was very early in the morning we encountered bed bugs. We saw it least 3. It was in room 529. We called the front desk they came to take pictures as they saw it too. Waiting to hear from management in the morning as to what they can do about this. We feel grossed out and now keep checking ourselves for bites. Also the headache of trying to disinfectant luggage etc. Thanks holiday Inn for ruining our vacation.  Think twice before staying here!My family and I were in town this past weekend for a wedding, and we were very happy with our stay at the Holiday Inn. Our room had a king-sized bed, sofa-bed, refrigerator and sink and was very spacious. The staff was very friendly and accommodated our request for an early check-in even though we arrived earlier than anticipated. We weren't crazy about the breakfast buffet, but since we had a refrigerator, we just bought some breakfast and lunch supplies at the Trader Joe's right down the road. The hotel is located right off Highway 17 and close to restaurants, grocery stores, and a short drive to the beach and downtown Charleston.Really liked it here. Clean with excellent service. Super close to the battleship museum and a short drive to downtown Charleston and the beach. We were really happy with the price vs the quality!If want to stay some where close to downtown Charleston; this is a good location. You would just be a few miles from one of the nicest beaches in charleston, isle of palms. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and comfort. The price can be a little pricey over the weekend but it's worth it.Let's start with I am a platinum member for this hotel chain. I checked in after 8 hours of traveling and they offered me an up-grade. The up-graded room they gave me was already being occupied by a family with an infant. Boy, they were surprised when I walked into the room. So I went down to get another room. So now at this point they down graded me back to a regular room.     The next day I retuned from work to find that housekeeping did NOTHING to my room other then bring in the newspaper. They left the bed unmade, dirty towels on the floor. To top off everything the Internet signal here is very weak and drops connections all the time. As a business traveler I will not be staying at this hotel again.Booked this hotel WAY in advance for the Bridge Run.  The room was okay, and the front desk friendly enough, but super rough on the wallet especially Bridge Run weekend.  I guess all the hotels have super inflated prices for that one weekend of the year when everyone flocks to Charleston.The good trade off was that I was 2 miles away from the start line so I was able to walk to the start, instead of worrying about parking, logistics, etc.Even for the price I paid, still had to grab breakfast somewhere else since they were charging at the restaurant downstairs.  Glad someone mentioned it to me before I started shoveling food onto my plate in the morning (the next morning after the run).  Just had a banana and muffins for the runners the morning of the bridge run, which was nice... but far from complementary.Very friendly staff, comfortable beds, and a great location. Others feel that it is overpriced, but I got a good deal on Priceline. The only real downside was the lack of complimentary breakfast or mini-fridges. Furthermore, the hotel restaurant was seriously overpriced and its food is nothing to write home about. However, the front desk staff have good suggestions on places to eat, and their suggestions are economical choices, too. In spite of the breakfast issues, I enjoyed my stay here.It is in a great location, right on the other side of the bridge so only a few minute drive to downtown Charleston.  They are pet friendly, with a cost.  Hotel room was clean and the staff was friendly.This was a good hotel. since I was running marathon weekend this was the only one  I could get but... staff was very nice and accomidating+ gave us a breakfast.This was a decent hotel for the money....I bid for it on Priceline and got it for $89/night. Of course you worry until you get there. But when all was said and done, I thought it was great! My only complaints was that there was no complimentary breakfast buffet (which is nice when you are traveling) and there was no refrigerator in the room...which also is helpful. There was some construction going on our floor...I think something to do with an ice machine that leaked. By the time we left a few days later, they were also fixing the lobby as well (I think from the same issue). So it wasn't pristine...but honestly not bad at all. The location is great...about 3 miles from downtown Charleston. So it's an easy drive right over the bridge and take the first exit to downtown. Really simple and much cheaper than staying in the downtown area of Charleston. So if you're looking for the Charleston experience, but you don't want extra expense with your hotel, I'd definitely look at this place! We had a nice time!Friendly and helpful staff, although the rooms smell like chlorine and bathrooms smell like cigarette smoke randomly. I won't be coming back here anytime soon.I'm not sure why it says this hotel has been renovated.....the lobby is ok but the rooms surely have not been renovated....at least not the room I stayed in. Plus, the room always felt somewhat damp even with the AC running constantly. If you are coming here on business be wary. This is one of the slooooooowest internet connections I've seen. I can barely send a simple email let alone load google maps which takes FOREVER. Just ridiculous. The staff here has always been nice though. The bar has two beer taps and not a microbrew in site. I asked the front desk if they could scan a document for me and they replied they did not have a scanner. Seriously?? How is it possible that a hotel doesn't have a scanner in their office? Once agian...not a business friendly hotel if you have alot of work to do on the computer.This was the last hotel I stayed at on my trip to the South. It was a priceline pickup The bathroom was updated. The room was updated. The pillows were comfortable. Over all, it was a great room for the price. It was literally a 5 minute drive across a beautiful bridge into Charleston. There is a $30 dollar hold on you credit card for the duration of your stay which is a low price. Breakfast is not complimentary, but available. The hotel includes ""friendliness features"". Forgot your shaving cream, they'll give you a free travel size bottle at the front desk. Their is a coin operated washer and dryer on every floor. The only detraction was a very noisy heating unit for my bedroom. It was loud enough to wake me up when it turned on in the night.This place is WONDERFUL! We got a super cheap rate from Hotwire for our anniversary weekend and I can say that we will be back!  The room was well appointed, clean, and comfy.  Same for the bathroom.  It was close enough to downtown Charleston for us.  Unless you are paying $400 a night for a luxury hotel right in the middle of downtown, you WILL have to drive to get to anything, so why not stay across the bridge and save your $$$ for the local cuisine!  The staff was super nice, but not very helpful when asked about places to go/eat...etc.  Charleston is world renowned for its food, so we asked the front desk guy where a good place for breakfast was.  His recommendation was for the restaurant in the hotel, which is fine, but when pressed for other suggestions, he said he ate at home.  So, if the staff had been a tad more helpful with ""local"" suggestions I would have given this 5 stars.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-mount-pleasant-2,Hampton Inn,4.0,$$,19,"Nice place to stay for either a short or long visit to the Charleston area. Just across the bridge in Mt. Pleasant you are about 7 minutes into downtown and all the sights to see. Minutes to beaches and tons of places to have breakfast, lunch or dinner. This is a very convenient location.Typical Hampton Inn with the complimentary breakfast in the lobby area. The lobby is very comfortable, open and clean. All the staff were super sweet. I think this property might be a little older and even though it looks like they had a renovation in the past I feel they should do another minor facelift to the rooms. Don't get me wrong, they are good but they could use some additional lighting, new sofas and updated bath area. Can't comment on the pool area as we didn't use it, or even see it. I would most definitely stay here again and would recommend this property to others.I enjoyed my stay in the Charleston area very much but my time at the Hampton Inn was another story. Upon entering the building I was greeted with a smell that one can only describe as an old animal hospital recently turned into a hotel. The smell in my room led me to believe perhaps that's where the stillborn baby calves were delivered. Someone suggested the smell was caused by the humidity. This is not a side effect of humidity I was previously aware of. My friend saw a cockroach in the bathroom on our first night and I killed one in the bedroom on the second night. That's two more cockroach encounters than I would like to deal with when staying in a hotel.The staff were very friendly and helpful, no complaints there. There was a pretty good selection at the continental breakfast, again, no complaints. However, I probably wouldn't stay at the Hampton Inn animal hospital again when visiting the Charleston area. There are several hotels nearby (including one in the same parking lot) that I would stay at before staying here, unless I was feeling lonely and wanted the company of cockroaches.Nothing special. Shower had a little mold in grout at bottom. Tv stopped working every night at 3 a.m. this is an older Hampton. The one closer to IOP is much nicer.In December 2015 it was a $12 uber ride to downtown and the room was very nice, great selection at vending machines, has a coffee bar and a great breakfast. very competitive price. I highly recommend this hotelI have stayed here a few times now and it is always nice and friendly, they have a nice clean pool.The fact that they are pet friendly is what makes us come back everytime!Decent property. Rooms clean and newer building. Pool is a little bit small. There was a convention ir something going on bc lots of rude people staying there. Front desk was really polite and helpful. Found a hair in the shower which was really gross! The manager apologized.Awesome hotel. Super clean, it didn't even seem like a Hampton. It seemed like a more upscale hotel. The only complaint I have was the shower had hair in it that was not ours.BEWARE OF BEDBUGS!!!!After checking in I inspected the bed as I usually do upon arrival and found several brown/red bugs and black hairs in the bed!! This was the worst hotel experience I have EVER had. We complained in the reception and got a room at the Best Western located next door. This hotel was extremely outdated and not at all equal to the room that we has booked at the hampton inn but since the Hampton inn was fully booked and it was midnight we had no choice but to stay there. Either way, we preferred that to the bed bug infested Hampton Inn. I will NEVER stay at a Hampton inn ever again- extremely disappointed and disgusted!!!I enjoyed my stay here. Very clean, nice staff, and good bed. If you're visiting Charleston, I would definitely recommend this hotel simply because of the price. You can stay across the bridge for $120+/night, but this is literally 10 minutes from downtown. So either you can pay for parking in the downtown hotels and be closer, or just drive the 10 minutes and pay cheaper rates on metered parking.I also thought that this location was nice because it's about 10 minutes from Sullivan's Island. Downtown Charleston is great, but it's nice being really close to the beach as well. A little tip though-- the complimentary breakfast is nothing to write home about. It's good if you're on a budget and want free breakfast, but I wouldn't expect to really fill up there. Right down the street is Charleston's Cafe which is good and moderately priced breakfast. They also have free wi-fi and a microwave in each room. Nice perks!If driving 5-10 minutes across the river to find parking is all that's needed to save $30-50 on a room; I'm all in!This is place to stay if you're going to be visiting Charleston and don't want to fork out for the downtown establishments and would like to avoid being near the airport.The breakfast is above average considering it's free, but I'd recommend a few other places like Charleston's Cafe just down the road.The rooms were super clean, with no funky smells and the staff was super courteous. Oh, and the WiFi is free. You can't ask for much more!Fantastic place. Just across the bridge. Less expensive than staying downtown. Very friendly staff. Decent breakfast. Very quiet AC/heat.Enjoyed my stay here during the cooper river bridge run, the check in staff were great with our late check in.  The room was very nice, very clean and very comforting overlooking the pool area.  The free breakfast was just enough to tide us over until lunch.  I didn't get to enjoy the workout facility but I would love to return on my next trip.  If you're not familiar with the area, it's a little hard to find as it is kind of hidden.I booked this place because it is one of the few Hilton properties in the Charleston area that allows pets (up to 40 lbs) and I had HHonors points burning a hole in my pocket.  At just 35,000 points a night, this place is a bargain.Located at Patriot's Point just over the Ravenel Bridge from Charleston in Mt. Pleasant, this hotel is just a stone's throw from all the attractions this region has to offer.  It's about a mile from the USS Yorktown, under five miles to Charleston's historic French Quarter, and under ten miles to neighboring islands.Because I travel for work and am usually put up in four-star properties in big cities, I always cringe about staying in three-star places, particularly in smaller towns like Charleston.  But this place far surpassed my expectations.  It's incredibly clean and our room was very spacious.  We stayed on what I'm assuming was the dog hall, which is near a dog-walking area just outside, equipped with duty bags and a trashcan for disposing of pet waste.  It didn't smell like pets, so that's a major bonus.The staff are very friendly and the free breakfast is a huge money saver.  Waffle station, pastries, muffins, crumpets, bagels, oatmeal, cereal, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, and some egg / gravy / hash browns combo.  This big is sadly not really vegetarian-friendly, as inconsiderate guests use one spoon for both dishes, even though there are two spoons there to use, so the scrambled eggs had sausage gravy mixed in on one day, and the home fries had ham scrambled eggs mixed in the next.  Boo.The folks staying here are mostly families, with some older and younger couples traveling with pets.  Not really the trendiest hotel clientele, but if you don't plan on just hanging out in the hotel all day, then it really doesn't matter.As aforementioned, pets up to 40 lbs are welcome.  They do say when you check in that you are not allowed to leave pets unattended in your room, except at breakfast time.  They provide contact information for area kennels and say that if you do leave your pet unattended in the room, you will be fined $150 if s/he disturbs other guests, and you will not receive housekeeping services that day.  We had our dog friend with us all day long---Sullivan's Island Beach, James Island County Park, lunch, then walking around the French Quarter, all in the uncommon heat of early September---and it would have been cruel to drag the lil fella to dinner with us, too.  Basically what I'm saying is, if you have a quiet pet (our guy never barks, except while playing at the dog park), and you put in your do not disturb sign, then you're fine letting your buddy sleep while you go out for dinner, etc.In sum, I'd recommend this as a great pet-friendly budget hotel.  We were very satisfied with our stay here.Good value hotel with comfortable rooms and a quiet environment. Close and conveniently located to downtown Charleston and the beaches of Sullivan Island. The only thing annoying was the spotty room service every day. Sometime we would come back at 4 pm and the room had not been done even though the hotel was partially empty. We always thought that the room service did this deliberately in order to avoid having to clean the whole room because obviously, at 4 pm we didn't want room service. However, we would stay here againI was a bit nervous about this hotel because their website was a bit random...but all nerves were thrown out the window upon my arrival. Of course I was super late for check-in (thanks airlines!), but the staff was very helpful and expedited my check-in so I could get some beauty sleep.  The room itself was on the small side, but modern and clean. The bathroom was really nice and the amenities were spot on. A very nice place to stay!Clean, quiet, good value.  B'fast area gets crowded and nowhere to sit.I was on vacation and I checked into this hotel. The rooms were nice, modern and plush just how I like it! I really enjoyed my stay and it wasn't too far of a drive to downtown Charleston. Highly recommend it!The address for this hotel shows up as 255 Sessions Way, but I think either address will work for GPS navigation.  It is a GREAT location if you plan on visiting Patriots Point.  You could honestly walk there if you wanted to, although there are a couple hotels that are within better walking distance (we drove, because it was really hot).  The hotel itself had all the standard Hampton amenities (breakfast, high speed internet, cookies in the evening, etc).  The outdoor pool was a good size so we used that quite a bit.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again for the price.Close to foot of Bridge for easy into Charleston Downtown . Great space for price . Staff was very friendly . Breakfast was good but hard layout made eating down stairs difficult . Over all one of the nicest Hamptons :)",,,,,"['nice', 'place', 'either', 'short', 'long', 'visit', 'area', 'across', 'bridge', 'pleasant', 'minutes', 'downtown', 'sights', 'see', 'minutes', 'beaches',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-charleston-airport-convention-center-north-charleston-2,Hyatt Place Charleston Airport Convention Center,4.0,$$,18,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The staff is super friendly. I was very very impressed with the breakfast staff. I watched them accommodate several request from other guest (some very particular request) with no hesitation and a smile. The location was excellent. It is between two highways, 526 and 26. It is around the corner from the outlet mall, Walmart, gas stations, and lots of food options. We were there for a weekend... Friday evening to Sunday afternoon. We were able to visit several beaches, malls, the harbor, eat, and more without more than a 20 minute drive to any place.This place is your average Hyatt. But I gave it 4 stars because the good outweighed the not as good. The good: friendly staff, big shower, free breakfast and Wi-fi, close to the airport, clean, free parkingThe not great: loud - you can hear all the traffic and sirens from outside as well as people in neighboring rooms when they are loud, elevators are slow as turtlesGlamorous this hotel is not, but it provides and good bed and shower when you need or want to be close to the airport.The room was great.The pool was great.The location is decent, planes fly overhead.The front desk is great, but guest services has some bad eggs.The internet is paid for... Really?The breakfast is fair.Overall, this hotel does not fulfill the expectations that the price sets.Overall nice stay - very clean property with friendly staff. Great breakfast with a good variety. Only complaint is that wifi did not work during the duration of the stay. Parking was also slightly limited at night as it filled up very quickly.Checked in last night 3/29/15.  During check-in, we were greeted by friendly staff; it was easy and quick.  There are two entrances (one in the rear) which is closer to the elevators but needs more lighting outside. Room was clean but as soon as I turned on the heater to 72 - there was an odor (maybe cleaning solution) that odorized our room like perfume.  Not too pleasant but once heater was turned off - odor stopped. It's spacious and open.  Wished there were (2) televisions.  Well, didn't drive to SC just to watch TV.  There is a mini-fridge which is always convenient when traveling with children.Bathroom (toilet &amp; tub) is very tight but manageable. Wish the fan and light were separate switches.  It's convenient that the the sink is outside of the toilet to allow others that may need to wash up can do it without waiting for someone in the toilet. Day 1 - exercise room is well lit with free weights, (2) treadmill w/ video, and more.  There are small towels to keep dry and cleaning wipes to wipe down the equipment before &amp; after workout.  Breakfast is nothing to boast about.  Very simple.  Funny Starbucks sign posted but cups are Seattle's Best.  Highlight of breakfast is the Yogurt (Activia).Day 2 - breakfast was alright.  Kids had no interest.  Staff are polite and professional.  The facility is kept clean.  Conveniently located near outlet mall and lots of eateries.The longer we stayed breakfast got worse. The sandwich breakfast meat was dry, the bagel and English muffin sandwiches was hard. Just ate the same thins each morning Actiivia yogurt with cottage cheese and tomato juice. On our next visit to Charleston will not be returning here.  The room rate doesn't not fit the quality of stay and service. Nothing against the staff it just that breakfast could be better is quality, taste and variety.DO NOT PICK THIS HOTEL!So, we had some major issues with this hotel. We had two bikes with us, and we called ahead and the staff informed us that they have room in storage for our bikes but when we arrived they do not. So, we ended up having to put the bikes in our room and they can only give us a room on the 2nd floor.Then, this is a pet friendly hotel so we had our dog with us, but we didn't know there is $75 additional charge until the day we check out. How is this even expectable? We called the general manager when we get home (since she was off on our check out day), she was very rude and told us, she would have found storage for our bikes and that the additional pet fee is standard. Well, we understand but first, she wasn't there, so it doesn't make a difference if she could have found room for our bikes. Second, I would be ok with the pet fee if I have known up front. How could you charge someone extra fees without informing them up front?Each time we stepped into the Hotel we were greeted very kindly. The bar and snack area was very nice. The room was very elegant, clean and spacious. I slept on too of the couch and I found it pretty comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel. And hooray for free parking!This hotel is great. Staff was very friendly and professional. Room was spacious and clean. Plenty of parking. Close to the outlets ,the airport and a bunch of restaurants.  Within walking distance of the convention center. I definitely would recommend a stay here if you're looking for a clean moderately priced place.I just can't give five stars.I asked for a high floor and ended up on two.On three there is a ginormous wildebeest stomping on every square inch of my roof.Sure it is not the hotels fault that fat people are inconsiderate, but they could use better quality building products to deaden the sound.Love this place! I spend 5 days per month on average, living in hotel rooms. On this occasion of a ten day business run up and down the east coast, I was fortunate to have my company book me at this hotel.I have never stayed at a Hyatt Place. Very boutique-like and trendy. From the moment I arrived at the airport to be picked up by their free shuttle and during my stay, the staff has been amazing. I am on day three of my 5 day stay and they treat me like family.Speaking of the free airport shuttle, the shuttle is available for any run within a 5 mile radius of the hotel which includes being taken to the North Charleston Visitors center to catch a shuttle downtown.They have free wifi in the rooms and a nice free breakfast spread in the mornings including several varieties of breakfast sandwiches if you are on the run. Two nights per week they have a hosted wine/beer hour two nights a week at the lobby bar.If at all possible try to request a corner king room which is very quiet.I am going to be a tourist for the next two days and could have moved to a hotel closer to downtown, however this stay is an excellent value and a good base of operations. I will be back on my next stay!The staff was great and very helpful however I woke up with 12 bed bug bites on my back and three days removed continue to deal and alleviate my scarred back. Stay away from room 414 or be sure to wear a full wet suit to avoid such a horrendous ordeal.I love this hotel!  I will always return here whenever I'm in Charleston, and encourage everyone else to do so as well.  The staff is spectacularly friendly; the rooms are so nice and new and clean and well set-up; the place is quiet and comfortable.  I am a Hilton Honors Gold Level member, who foolishly chose the Home2 Suites down the road for our first night in CHS after a long flight from CA.  Let's just say ""never again"" and will forego the earning of Hilton points to earn my Hyatt points here :)Excellent customer service! I don't know if this is just a characteristic of the ""South"" (I'm having good service everywhere in Charleston!) but they were very attentive to my every need and if something took longer than 10 seconds they apologized profusely... to my confusion. The food here is pretty good! I usually am expecting awful food from hotels of this type (no offense!) but their food is actually delicious and well-presented. I tried their breakfasts, nachos, pizza and burger. Their burger was only OK but the rest were pretty good! Tied for first place would be their breakfasts and pizza--they are excellent. While they don't have as wide a range of breakfast items as other places like Embassy Suites, I think they have higher quality ingredients here and are prepared better. First time I've had perfect scrambled eggs! Usually I get them too soggy or too dry or just ""wilted"" from being left out too long. Here they were just right! I ate lots of them and I usually hate scrambled eggs. I also really liked the interesting ""refrigerator"" for their drinks which consists of a countertop that's frozen. It's kind of like a hotplate except cold. Very cool!I also like that these rooms are sort of like suites (they are not true suits because they lack a wall--they have only a divider) and they have sofabeds with QUEEN mattresses... what?!?I also think the blond lady who does everything at the reception desk and food desk is really cute and helpful! The manager was a bit strict with her, I felt, though. She did some amazing multitasking in front of me (I would have gone crazy already in her place) and was able to help me while talking to a bagillion other people. Tee hee, not to be rude but the manager reminded me of Marci from MWC. Short hair and businessy--not that that's bad or anything. When the manager helped me she was also very helpful and nice as well.Great, modern hotel with surprisingly large rooms. We arrived in Charleston this past Friday night just before midnight. The shuttle to the hotel stops running at 12AM, but the girl who runs the nighttime front desk was nice enough to pick us up (she was heading out to pick up an Army band that was out at a bar anyway). She also went above and beyond and dropped us off to a 24 hour Walmart en route so that we could pick up all the things that TSA made us throw away at the airport.The room was spacious, had a sectional sofa with ottoman, king sized bed, and a large flat screen TV that swiveled so you could watch from the sofa or the bed. The bed itself was a posturepedic of some sort (you sink into the bed, in a nice way of course) and had tons of pillows. The TV has a media hook up for your laptop or other media players.They also offer a complimentary breakfast complete with baked goods, cereals, eggs, sausage, and juice bar.You'll have a nice time here.Easily the most fabulous hotel in North Charleston! I originally intended to travel with others and reserved a double queen. Less than 24 hours before arrival I was able to call and seamlessly switch to a king room as my plans changed. I thought I was just getting a regular king room with a bed in it. My goodness! This was suite style, and featured an awesome sectional sofa with pullout sleeper and ottoman. Since the weather was gloomy this trip, I spent more time indoors than I anticipated. The sectional and 42"" flatscreen tv was a MUCH welcomed addition to the room, I felt right at home! Also features a minibar and office nook for those who need to work. The bed was very, very comfy, bathroom only had a shower which was fine for me, bathroom vanity features pull out dresser drawers-fabulous-and the full mirror doubles as a closet. There is a cafe attached to the downstairs check-in desk that you may purchase sandwiches, soup, drinks and pastries from 24 hours a day. I attended a conference at the convention center; they do offer a shuttle but it's literally right behind the hotel in walking distance so I rarely used it. Parking is above ground in an open lot and FREE. Location convenient to the interstate and every restaurant imaginable. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended!A plus. Stayed four nights. Very comfortable, extremely clean and quite rooms. Also numerous restaurants near by. There is no doubt if I travel through this area again I am going to stay here. Also shuttle to and from the airportCan't beat this place. Nice modern rooms. 24 hour food. Indoor pool. Still smells new like it is. Highly recommend.The staff here is amazingly friendly! The rooms are spacious, modern, and clean. Nightly managers get together with free food and drinks.",,,,,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'hotel', 'staff', 'super', 'friendly', 'impressed', 'breakfast', 'staff', 'watched', 'accommodate', 'several',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/king-george-iv-inn-charleston,King George IV Inn,4.5,$$,18,"My husband and I were extremely pleased with King George IV Inn- from the moment we drove up the brick-laden driveway right up to the easy check-out. The woman who greeted us and showed us to our room was wonderfully friendly and helpful, there was snacks, coffee, tea, etc available 24 hours a day, and the breakfast had a delicious assortment of foods. The best part was the room; it was historic, nicely decorated, very cozy and very clean- and it had WiFi. The owner was friendly and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this B &amp; B.My boyfriend and I came and stayed here the weekend after thanksgiving and it was nothing short of a great experience. It was both of our first trips to Charleston, and we couldn't have picked a better place to spend our weekend. Everything was decorated for Christmas, including our room (room number 4) which was absolutely beautiful! the owners were kind and helpful in pointing us where to go and what to see. Whenever we come back to Charleston, I plan to book here again!I can not say enough great things about our stay at the King George IV Inn- what a gem of an inn located in downtown Charleston. When I was looking for a place to stay in Charleston, I was surprised that a B &amp; B was one of the best priced places in the whole city- and it was worth every penny. I would recommend this place to anyone- Charlene was fantastic. She cooked our breakfast every morning, provided excellent Charleston &amp; restaurant recommendations, and made our stay perfect. Our room was beautiful- we stayed in Room #5- which had a small kitchen w/ a fridge, a full size bed w/sitting area, two closets, full private bathroom, and a shared balcony with the room next door. The room was spotless and well cared for during our entire stay. I will certainly be staying here the next time I come to Charleston- don't look any further for a great place to stay!My boyfriend and I took our first vacation together this past weekend. We stayed in a room on the first floor at the King George IV Inn. The inn is located right next to the College of Charleston's gym and right around the corner from campus so a lot of students are in the area. It's also conveniently located between King and Meeting streets so many great restaurants and shops are very close by. The room was nice but it did smell a little musty in there. You can't open the windows because of bugs and animals but once you let the AC run for awhile it mellows out a bit (or maybe you just get used to it I don't know). We were definitely the youngest couple there, everyone else was easily twice our age but I thought that was kind of charming! But it's definitely an older crowd, so keep that in mind. The owners are a super sweet couple, I only met Terry but I spoke to his wife on the phone and she seemed very sweet as well. Terry gave us a very detailed run down of the area and where to go to and what to see. They also make a lovely breakfast in the morning with eggs, waffles, hash browns, grits, and bacon. It changes up every morning but there's always eggs and bacon. (I haven't been to any other bed and breakfasts though, so not sure how this would compare somewhere else). We had a very lovely stay for our first trip together and I would definitely go back.I found this place last minute and the location and setup worked out perfectly! The rate was also very reasonable! Charlene was very helpful with area tourists suggestions and the breakfast she put out daily was delicious. I will absolutely be recommending this place to friends and going again soon, especially during the off season with the even lower rates! The bedrooms were clean and charming!I'm so glad that we found this bed &amp; breakfast! I can't gush enough about this place. This was our third stay here and that's saying something. Room 5 is our favorite room: it has a small kitchen, private balcony, and roomy bathroom. Room 6 is nice too, but I felt the bathroom was too small (no counter space). It's beautiful at Christmas, though.When you arrive, Terry (the owner) will sit down with you and give you a map of downtown Charleston. He highlights all the hot spots and what to avoid so that you can make the most out of your visit. I really appreciated that! He told us about Christophe's and I can't thank him enough!The location is great; minutes away from all the places to see. We never drive anywhere when we stay here, so bring some good walking shoes if you want to see Charleston at a different perspective. From here to the Battery is about a 10-15 minute walk.The housekeeping staff is the best. Charlene is a sweetheart! We had the pleasure of chatting with her during breakfast one morning. And I for one am a huge fan of the breakfast. Terry does a fantastic job with his made to order omelets. The breakfast area is always available, so I found that nice when we were out late and wanted a quick snack when we returned.Also, each room has it's own journal that contains entries from past occupants. They highlight places to try and places to avoid. So, make sure you submit your own entry! This is definitely our go-to bed &amp; breakfast anytime we're in Charleston. It definitely makes you feel like you're in a different time, where time slows down and southern hospitality shines.we were traveling without any advance reservation and stopped at the Charleston Visitor Center . they were terrific help and we got a room at a very reasonable rate. Room 5 is the best. sitting room, queen bed, kitchenette,  old fashioned tub. would definitely stay here again. only complaint was breakfast was mediocre. scrambled eggs and bacon self served. got the same at chain hotels. Staff was very attentive and friendly.Staying in an old house turned B&amp;B ran by a couple with over 15 years of ownership under their belts is just what you'd expect to find in Chuck Town. Well, by golly, we struck gold with this joint. Owner, Terry, and his wife have a wonderful operation with plenty of cozy rooms outfitted to feel like an early 1900's-style living room. Talk about southern living. We stayed in room 3. Second floor, gigantic shower, tons of lounge space, and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in away from home. My wife and I agree that we wish we had that bed in our home. Giant four-poster with a mammoth mattress. Me likey, me want. Breakfast is cooked fresh by Terry and served promptly at 8:30 every morning. Not a bad deal when you need to forgo an expensive Chuck Town breakfast elsewhere. Oddly enough, this place has some of the more competitive rates we saw around town. Take a look as I'm sure they'll fluctuate, but they seemed to be much lower comparatively. Beware of the small parking situation they have out back. If you're driving a gigantic SUV, you'll have to cram in. Maneuvering with pilot precision required. Next time we find ourselves in the historic district, we're staying here.We love to stay in historic buildings and dine family-style with other guests in a cozy breakfast room, especially in a beautiful old city like Charleston, so the King George was perfect for us. The owners and staff of this place are amazing--after only two days we felt like part of the family. A very relaxed and relaxing place, with lots of character. The inn is very well located, and everywhere we wanted to go in downtown was walking distance. We can't wait to go back!This place was great! We couldn't find a hotel in Charleston under $300 a night and this place offered a great deal! We stayed in a room that shared a bathroom but with a sink and mirror in the room, it wasn't a big deal at all! The breakfast was just what we needed to start our day and spend our calories and money on lunch and dinner and the delicious food at Fleet Landing.We highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Charleston. The location couldn't have been beat! We will definitely return.Very clean and very close to all of the downtown action. You will park your car and walk to everything. This is an original single row home that gives you the feel for the rich history of Charleston. The hotel has its own history, just ask the staff!  Breakfast is good, eggs, bacon, sausage each morning with fresh fruit, English muffins, bagels, yogurt, cereal.....something for all tastes.  Ms. Charlene is a wealth of information about where to visit, eat and how to get around. We found the road out front to be a bit noisy but that will be anywhere you go in the city. The inn has ear plugs in the breakfast room as well as snacks out at all times. Sodas and water are available for $0.50 each. Our room had its own bathroom, a mini fridge and kitchenette area. It's room 6 and is probably cleaner than any hotel or B&amp;B I've ever stayed in. We took our bikes and highly recommend it for touring the city streets, however we didn't see any other tourists on bikes so doesn't seem really popular.  See my other reviews for stuff to do in Charleston.Really beautiful b&amp;b, really fantastic location. The owners were wonderful - on our first day we were sat down and had a long discussion about things to do and where to eat in Charleston, given some cookies and coffee, and coupons for a few restaurants.  Room was beautifully decorated, and we especially loved having our own little balcony and staircase. Really great price!I am removing just one star for the same thing that the other reviewer mentioned - compared to other b&amp;bs, breakfast could have been better. The eggs were really good (scrambled with sun-dried tomato and red peppers!) but the bacon and sausage and waffles were all microwaved. Of course, still better than what you might get at a motel, and the company was fantastic - really nice conversations over the breakfast table with other nice couples. Overall a fantastic b&amp;b!What a charming and quaint B&amp;B! Beautifully restored 250-year-old house, well decorated rooms, and we loved the period furniture. Terry was helpful and informative and helped make our stay wonderful! We stayed in Room 7 with a shared bathroom with Room 8. But having your own sink &amp; mirror in your own room is very convenient. Also, the most comfortable bed you will ever sleep on!We will definitely return!The staff is very friendly!! My Mother and I stayed here (with her service dog) Terry and Debra-the owners were very attentive and are genuinely great people. The B and B is so beautiful and authentic. I feel like I'm in the 18th century.  Great location....in the heart of Charleston!! You can't beat the price either:) a must stay!!Couldn't have asked for better. This is a great B&amp;B. We stayed in room 7 and shared the hallway bathroom with room 8. We had no issues with this whatsoever. Loved the atmosphere,the breakfast,the owners, and the price. Will definitely stay here again next time we're in Charleston.We found the King George through the Visitor's Center and got a great rate as a last minute rental.  Very convenient to downtown, nice, clean, private, great breakfast, nice staff, and a great rate as a last minute special on Friday night!I might have a higher rating if we didn't have to share a bathroom, but for 129 a night, the location can't be beat.Skip the breakfast that is provided (microwave bacon and a tray of scrambled eggs?)  made that mistake the first day.  The second day we headed out and went into a city that has such great food options.  Say hello to Hominy Grill for me.  yaow!The water pressure in the shower went from cold and soft as a kitten spitting to hot and razor sharp, removing all the skin.But, the room was comfortable and the location was key.  Just between king and meeting on george, with a parking lot in the back.I would stay again, but would want my own bathroom (many of the rooms do have their own, but space was limited due to the festival in town).I stayed at this inn for one night as a solo traveler. It is not a luxury B&amp;B, but my room was beautiful and the service was fantastic. It is not particularly close to the battery/White Point Gardens, Waterfront Park, or Market areas, but it is definitely close enough to walk easily. Apparently there is also a shuttle that can pick you up, but I prefer to walk when in Charleston. I would stay again and would absolutely recommend this inn to solo travelers, business travelers, and travelers on a budget.",,,,,"['husband', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'king', 'inn', 'moment', 'drove',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/planters-inn-charleston,Planter's Inn,4.0,$$$,39,"Stayed here in November 2012 for a couple of days. Our company hosted our incentive trip in Charleston last year and we stayed at the Planter's Inn - we had to have at least 15-20 rooms so I don't even want to imagine what the bill looked like, but one can imagine. The rooms themselves are fantastic - large, comfortable beds, nice TVs, decent bathrooms (some have jet tubs, which mine did), and uber-comfortable robes. As it was 50 and raining when we were there, coming back after a few hours of walking and soaking in a hot tub and wrapping up in a giant robe was pretty nice, let me tell you. And yeah, I'm a guy. Problemo?Location has to be pretty perfect. Right next to the market and down the street from a ton of food and shopping. If you're looking for more finer dining, Planters Inn has the Peninsula Grill as well. Apparently the coconut pie is world famous, and better be for $11 a slice!Anywho, I would love to stay here again but it's a bit out of my price range. Need to travel on the company's dime again!Took me awhile to sit down and write a review for this Relais &amp; Chateaux property.Shout out to the Manager who is FIVE stars.  What a nice lovely gentleman who went above and beyond.  He is an asset to this hotel and deserves whatever accolades can be bestowed upon him.Shout in to the Owners who get negative stars for pulling the pet friendly policy the prior owners offered.  In this day and age, there are those of us upscale travelers who enjoy traveling avec chien.  Why in the world would you be so anti pets?  It simply doesn't make sense.  The Carlyle in NYC welcomes them, for Heaven's sake, as do many other upscale hotels around the country.I did not like my room one bit.  It was most definitely not like staying in a standard Relais &amp; Chateaux.  I could go on and on about it but I won't.  My initial bell man was also a joke.  Again, not in line with the Relais &amp; Chateaux ambiance.  Items that were in line with what Relais &amp; Chateaux stands for, however, aside from the Manager, included the overnight desk clerk.  This lovely lady had great energy and kindly found me some soy milk early in the morning with a pleasant, welcoming Southern charm.  The afternoon tea/coffee and cookies were delicious and made you feel as if you were being entertained in the parlor of an old charming southern plantation.  And, the coconut cake found in the restaurant is actually trademarked and is A+++.  You can easily take some to go and enjoy on the road.   The manager is most definitely THE standout of the hotel but if you are traveling with le chien, then try the Wentworth Mansion or the new Kimpton being built downtown.It would not surprise me in the least bit if this place loses their Relais &amp; Chateaux designation.I hate to be picky, but I was really expecting more. Front staff was welcoming, and I commend the inn on their attentive hospitality. The room is where I felt disappointed, though. Unfortunately, I did not try their restaurant. I stayed in a double queen room. The beds were turned down in the evening, and the sleep was impeccable. The armchairs were comfortable, but there was only one footrest. It also would have been nice to have slippers provided to wear down to the parlor, which is stately and stocked with cider, coffee, and ""Carolina apples."" The apples are meh, like red delicious quality. As for my nitty gritty complaints: There was a single window in the bedroom, which couldn't sufficiently light the room naturally. The bathroom didn't boast a luxurious bathtub as depicted on their website; it was a standard tub/shower combo built into the wall. I honestly expected to be enjoying a bubble bath in a marble tub, as suggested by their distinguished reputation. The hand towel rack kept falling off the wall. And the full length mirror on the door clattered whenever it was opened. Moreover, the bathroom door hit anyone who was using the sink, which was illogically placed adjacent to the door despite a wide counter space.Oh, and there were no orchids in the room as advertised in their pictures.Great staff, location, rooms, linens and beds, with a clean historic, yet updated decor.  Wish we had a longer stay! We will be back! Andrea at the front desk was lovely and very helpful!Great location to most of the sites in the downtown area.  The room service was not good.  requested hot water and tea bags delivered to the room.  water was not hot.  No decaf coffee available in the lobby in the morning.  Tried to use hot water instead no one seems to be checking to make sure it was replenished.  Asked the person at front desk to have some tea in the lobby during the day after 20 mins no one showed up.Attention to detail is lacking for the prices charged for a room.went here late April '15 for Mariana's BD and our 1 year anniversary. Room was beautiful and staff was extremely helpful. Centrally located in the heart of the historic district and within walking distance of everything we wanted to see in the downtown areaI had the pleasure to stay at the Planters Inn for three days in the beginning of July.  This was my first visit to South Carolina and I must say I loved it.  The Planters Inn is a lovely and quaint hotel oozing in southern charm.  I have to tell you ladies that the Planters has the best looking male staff I have ever seen.  Not only are they great to look at but they were so accommodating .  The room was spacious, the bed large(I have to admit I have never slept in a bed so high off the ground),the sheets soft and inviting after a day exploring lovely Charleston.  We enjoyed the continental breakfast during our stay which was elegant,no gas station muffins here. The service was top notch,everyone was pleasant,southern hospitality at its best.This is an excellent hotel.  As soon as we pulled up to the door, the valet was there ready to assist with luggage and to valet the car.  The valet radioed the front desk to our arrival and our check in paper work was ready by the time we got to the front desk.  The staff was very courteous and efficient.  The front desk manager asked about our dinner plans for the weekend and then made a reservation for us at The Peninsula.  Andre, the valet, was now ready with our luggage to show us to our room.  From getting out of the car to getting into our room was a matter of minutes.  The entire stay was great.  The room was spacious and clean, the staff was very attentive and friendly.  The Peninsula bar and the restaurant were also great.  Again, the bartenders and servers were great at their jobs and friendly as well.  I will definitely stay here again.Just incredible hospitality. Period. Beautiful hotel. Clean rooms and courtyard was so nice. Fresh coffee all day everyday. Was like I was being waited on 24/7, serious southern hospitality! Hotel is right on Main Street, walking distance to everything!! Pull up to front entrance of building. Bell hops will greet you to take luggage and park your car!! (I didn't know where to park and ended up in employee parking- oops.)Outstanding customer service! Our favorite place to stay in Charleston. Thank You Jake.Although the hotel has nice lobby and helpful staff the location of the hotel is at a busy intersection.  ask for a room overlooking courtyard, otherwise expect a noisy room.  Even with earplugs I was up all night hearing people, cars, and trucks go by. Not the cleanest room found extra pillows in closet with a drool spot and the other had hair on it. Needless to say I will not be recommending this to friends.Nice hotel in great location but for some reason charleston hotels feel no need to conduct any updates. Rooms have a great old school feel but could use some refresh in the actual room (new toilets and showers might be nice). Wallpaper and everything else could also use an update. Service is nice but most of staff has yet to graduate college.Definitely pricey at $300+ a night but this is a fantastic little gem right in the heart of historic Charleston.  Only a block away from shopping on Kings Street and immediately adjacent to the Market Street shops on Meeting Street, the hotel has it all.  Home to the fabulous Peninsula Grill (you have to eat there, no ifs, ands, or you know whats).  Also home to the Mercato next door (Italian and a nice bar).  Just one block away from Toast, the best breakfast place in town and home to a fabulous tiny bar with a master mixologist as the bartender - Matt).The service at the Planters Inn was impeccable.  From the cleanliness of the rooms to the turndowns at night and the fluffy robes.  Large bathrooms and oh so quiet.  The bed was firm and perfect.  A great place to spend three nights.  The front end staff in this large inn were also responsive to every single wish.  Couldn't ask for more.Second stay in 3 years and again very enjoyable.  Great staff and large rooms and bathrooms.   Had breakfast in the room this morning with the family and it was perfect.  Courtyard rooms may provide a little extra privacy but I did not find the outer room a problem.  Close to market and high end shopping as well a number of very good restaurants. Will definitely stay here again in the future.Along with death and taxes, one of the sure things in life -- at least to this point -- had been the flawless pampering, albeit at a price, you could expect at a hotel or restaurant affiliated with Relais &amp; Chateaux. In the last couple of years we've dined at Per Se, Daniel, and Eleven Madison. We've stayed and dined at The Inn at Little Washington, The Surrey, and Blantyre. The quality of product and service at each has been exemplary. Few, if any, nits to pick. So little did I expect to be doing my own troubleshooting for the Internet service at Planter's Inn in Charleston.Let me back up a bit. We just got back from a three-night stay at the Planter's Inn. On the whole, the experience was satisfactory. Our suite, #201, was nicely appointed and spacious. The hotel restaurant, The Peninsula Grill, provided us with one of the better meals of our trip and the housekeeping services were friendly and efficient. The bathroom was a bit under-appointed and the television remote baffling, but these shortcomings were too trivial to rise even to the level of annoyances.I'm not a good complainer. I'm just not good a being a squeaky wheel. When a hotel provides good service, very little squeaking elicits an adequate and immediate dose of grease. The first night at Planter's Inn, I noticed that the wireless Internet in our room was all but useless. When I mentioned this to the front desk, they sent up a bellman (the same one who had parked our car and handled our luggage) who simply turned the wireless off then on again. When this did not improve things, he apologized, suggested I try the business center, took my $5 tip, and left. Using the business center entailed going to the front desk, getting the key, going to the 4th floor, doing the work, then returning the key back down to the front desk. Not a big deal, but not quite up to my R &amp; C expectations. The hotel, after all, had done nothing to lessen the inconvenience of the experience. Perhaps the bellman could have offered to fetch the key for me, particularly as I had tipped him for a service that he shouldn't have had to provide (one expects the wireless to work, after all) and that he had failed to repair.When I returned the key to the front desk, I mentioned that the wireless on my laptop had worked just fine in the business center. In fact, all my devices seemed to work well everywhere in the hotel except in our room. I asked about the possibility of changing rooms. The receptionist to whom I spoke said he'd ""look into availability."" I hesitated long enough to be sure that he wasn't going to take care of this then and there and went back to the room expecting to hear from him. I'll save you the suspense -- the call never came. I didn't ask again; remember, I just don't do the squeaky wheel thing.By our third night at the hotel, the amount of work I had to do online had accumulated to the point that this reluctant wheel was forced to squeak just a bit. I called the front desk and reminded them of the problem. They responded by giving me the toll-free number of their Internet provider! Mind you, they didn't volunteer to call the service themselves -- they expected me to do it!I wasn't pleased, but I placed the call. Turns out, the number they gave me was the cell phone of an employee of the ISP. He gave me the correct number to call. I was on hold for exactly 17 minutes when we had to leave for our dinner reservation, so I left a message to call me back after 9:00. Of course that call never came. And had it come, I wouldn't have expected it to do much good. I really did find the service lapses shocking, given that this is a Relais &amp; Chateaux hotel. The staff was young and seemed inexperienced. For example, entering the hotel, the doormen would often be engaged in such intense conversation with each other I felt I was imposing by expecting them to open the door.The next day we were off to a lovely B&amp;B in Raleigh that I'll review when I get the time. The wireless there worked flawlessly, even from our private hot tub! Ahhhhhh!The best location in Charleston across the street from the marketplace on Market and Meeting. Gorgeous, quiet, spacious, well-appointed room. Exceptional service, very comfortable beds with turn down service (#217) and the coconut cake at the Peninsula Grill is a must if you're a coconut cake fan!We had a wonderful stay at the Planter's Inn, which can be expected of a Relais et Chateaux Hotel.The hotel is located right in the heart of the historic Old Town, and is the perfect location to explore that part of town on foot.  The high-end shops are one block away, the horse-drawn carriages are around the block (the hotel gave us tickets as part of our package) and the Market is right in front of the hotel.  The hotel is surrounded by the nicest little stores, not touristy at all.The hospitality and friendliness commences as soon as you pull up in front of the hotel.  There is only standing room in front of the hotel, but the valet immediately opens your door, takes care of the luggage and then parks your car.The hotel feels very safe as a key is needed to operate the elevator to go to the rooms.  The room we had was very spacious and felt like home.  It was very clean, was quiet despite being on a busy street and it looked good as well.  The whole hotel had an old charm feel.  Free wi-fi was available throughout the hotel, including the rooms.  It was a little slow and spotty, but it did the trick for me.Breakfast was delicious, and can be a la carte or a $10 buffet.  The buffet selection is not big, but it is of the highest quality.  They have some amazing grits and sausage gravy, so definitely splurge on the a la carte choices.  All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and checkout was a breeze.  The best part of the hotel is the restaurant,The Peninsula Grill.  Be sure to make a reservation because this restaurant is the best in town, and you can tell by the fact that it is very busy.  The food is delicious; and they serve the best Coconut Cake in the US.  Often statements like those prove not to be true, but in this case it certainly was.Charleston is one of the nicest cities I have been to recently, and I would love to go back.  I would not hesitate to stay at the Planter's Inn again.Great location but nothing particularly memorable about the hotel. It's good quality yet nothing stands out.My boyfriend brought me here for Valentine's Day, and we had an AMAAAZING experience. The Planter's Inn is small, but very nice and quaint. From your first step on the property, the staff here definitely shows you what Southern hospitality is all about. The rooms are very classy and comfortable. Through the hotel, my boyfriend was able to have home-made chocolates and roses waiting inside. Actually, my boyfriend asked for a room with a jacuzzi tub, but we were first taken to a room without one. He called in, and staff graciously showed us to the appropriate room. Both rooms were equally beautiful. And again, staff was very courteous and hospitable. Location is great and very central to many great places downtown. Overall, we had a great time in a very beautiful and relaxing setting.This hotel is amazing. One of the nicest luxury historic hotels I've been in. The room furnishings are top notch and the location is perfect for exploring downtown Charleston. The staff attend to every need without being obtrusive.","We stayed at the Planter's Inn for our wedding night. The room was beautiful and charming. The bed was so comfortable we actually fell right to sleep! The only thing I regret is not buying that teddy bear they place on the bed or the extra soft robes. I wasn't to thrilled about the room service food in the morning but all in all it was wonderful.Planter's Inn and the Peninsula Grill have both gotten a (rare) 5 star review from me. From the room, to the service, to the location I can't say enough good things (thus a 5 star review it is).We got a package deal for a ""deluxe king"" in their ""piazza"" wing, which in addition to the room included valet parking and continental breakfast (or half off full service breakfast) at the Peninsula Grill. First, the room - I want the room in my house - it was filled with furniture that had touches of southern detail, especially a four poster bed and luxurious linens that I wanted to pack up in my luggage and take with me. The room didn't skimp on modern conveniences either, with central HVAC, noise insulating windows, a jacuzzi tub, and complimentary wifi throughout the hotel. Service was top notch, from the (cute-to-boot) valet to the concierge to the room service (we came back to find the results of the evening turndown service - two bottles of water, a filled ice, drawn curtains, two creme cookies and a teddy bear perched on the bed pillows).Location was great, about a 10-15 minute walk to the battery and the shops of city market and king street are right outside the door (personal plus, Ben &amp; Jerry's a couple of storefronts down on Market!).Without a doubt one of the best hotel stays I've had.Actually I would give this establishment 3 1/2 stars.  First off,  Planter's Inn was a lovely and charming place.  However, upon arriving, the front desk clerk was alone and trying her best to take care of 5 people at once.  She called for help but did not get any until a third try.  The clerk was wonderful and was certainly apologetic  to everyone.  Not her fault in any way.  We were disappointed in our room as the toilet 'ran' for about 30 seconds every 20 minutes.  Also, there was 'something red' on the drapery (looked like blood) and the underside of our  cream colored bedspread had green stains on it. I did take pictures and showed it to the front desk upon leaving.  The only reason for even saying anything was so that the drapes could be changed before the next occupants. As we were getting into our car the desk clerk came running out telling us the manager said ""this is unacceptable"" and a credit would be given...didn't really expect anything...good thing as it has been  over two weeks and have not seen any credits thus far.  For the amount of money this room cost ($350/night), one would think the maid would catch this.  Morning coffee. $8.50 for room service plus tax and gratuity. Enough for 1 person. Complimentary coffee was in their guest salon...however, we had to go down 3 floors and out in the rain into the main building to get it. I suppose it would have been better if the weather had been sunny.   Perhaps 'in room' coffee service would be something for Planter's Inn to consider in the future.  The valet parking attendants were spectacular !  The young men that helped us with our luggage were fantastic.  Very knowledgeable  of area.  They were a great help.  Exceptional staff but other offerings were none better than any $150 dollar room.This place was very charming!!The front door man (Allan) quickly befriended us and made our experience in Charleston a great one! The hospitality of this small hotel was amazing and really one of a kind. The room was beautiful! It had a jacuzzi tub which I mysteriously found myself drawn to every single night! The bathrobes were amazing as well! I cannot find one as soft or as warm and I am trying! The room service was great! Everyday we would come back from our adventures and find gifts of pralines and chocolate and nice comforting music. The location is perfect. You are right in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of the markets in South Carolina but it is quiet enough to be restful. I loved the fact that we did not have to worry about parking at all. The valet took care of everything for us and they were as nice and speedy and could be!Stayed at the inn for a long weekend and had a really nice stay here.  The hotel was in the perfect location, right across from the Market and within walking distance to King Street.  I thought our room was great and the bed was extremely comfortable.  If we ever travel back to Charleston, I would stay here again.We were late by 7 hours getting in due to an accident and emergency medical treatment.  Could have been the worst day, but they had everything ready including a pedicab to get us to Circa 1886 for dinner.  I appreciated the feeling that they were taking care of us.  Given what we went through, it was truly appreciated.  Beautiful room, great location next to everything, and excellent service.Wonderful Staff, Beautiful rooms. VERY nice place to stay. Will certainly make a return visit.The Planter's Inn is a great small hotel. The decor in the room was fantastic; simple and classic southern. Everyone on staff was very hospitable and they greeted you with a Mr. and Mrs. every time. They even had standing reservations for us at the Peninsula downstairs (a true treat). The beds and linens were top notch, but the bathrooms could use an update. The tub was an early 90's jet.... I felt that a claw foot tub would have been more appropriate considering the rest of the decor.  We were able to walk to all of the restaurants and visit all of the attraction within minutes. Very good location if you plan to take in a lot of the scenery in old Charleston. If you are going to stay for multiple nights, be aware of the valet charges. The concierge got my wife a hair appointment in minutes at a top-notch salon before we had dinner at the Peninsula Grill downstairs.I really enjoyed my stay at the Planter's Inn. What sticks out the most is the service. Everyone who worked their was really friendly &amp; helpful. They gave us some great tips on where to eat (and they weren't all restaurants the hotel owns, though they did that too). The room &amp; the bathroom were large. The location of this hotel is also great. It was close to everything we did practically. We had a rental car but only needed to use it when we drove to the plantations. Two thumbs up!The Planter's Inn is a gem of a small inn in a central location. Our large room facing the courtyard was beautifully decorated with a fireplace and a large bathroom. Our comfortable four-poster bed came with its own welcoming teddy bear. The bathroom was large and there were nice bathrobes and toiletries.To get the most out of the inn it is best to make use of the fabulous associated restaurant, the Peninsula Grill. (Remember to make dinner reservations when you book your room.) In addition to dinner, when the weather is fine the lovely courtyard is a wonderful place for breakfast and for sipping drinks bought at the bar.The amenities would get the Planter's Inn four stars; the fifth star is because of the staff. The employees of both the inn and the restaurant are charming, exquisitely polite and helpful.This Inn was great and in the heart of downtown. Nightlife is waking distance, the market is across the street, the food is great and the rooms are amazing. My wife loved this inn. I highly recommend it.The Planter's Inn of Charleston is, as are many others, a historic hotel.  It has been around for God knows how long.  I first discovered it while looking for a nice, established hotel for my wife and I to stay on a weekend venture into the historic area of Charleston.The biggest plus Planter's has going for it is location.  It sits on the corner of Market St. and is adjacent to King Street--some of the finest shopping areas you are likely to find in downtown Charleston.  Everything is within walking distance.On the negative, the facility was under renovation of the exterior which was not mentioned on any of the pamphlets, booking sites, or when a call was placed to the front desk for reservation verification.  While this eyesore didn't affect the interior, it certainly limited the view my wife and I would have enjoyed from within our suite.  Additionally, upon arrival, it was discovered that the desk staff or booking agent had withheld incorrect dates for our stay.  They weren't expecting us for 2 more days apparently.  After some chat, they apologized and placed us in an upgraded suite (still, with limited to no visibility out of the rooms windows).The beds were fantastic 4-poster, the service (overall) was wonderful, and our stay was good.  I would certainly consider returning -- but it is doubtful that I would pay the same rates.  Overpriced for what you get in my opinion.Note: Our stay was from Aug. 16-19th 2007.  Construction is completed at this time (or seemed to be when we recently passed by the hotel around the first of August 2008).A great place to stay.  My wife and I stayed there after one night at the Doubletree down the street.  The Planter's Inn offered top notch service with southern hospitality.  Great location and remarkable rooms makes this a place to return.  The next time in Chucktown we are staying here.  The breakfast was outstanding and the wait staff offered the best service of our trip.This unassuming hotel is exceptional. The staff is attentive and inviting, but not intrusive. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to other travelers.This hotel is walking distance from everything worth seeing in Charleston.  It is right outside of the market and just on the other side of that is the waterfront. If you exit out of the hotel in the other direction you are right next to Charleston's response to Rodeo Dr.  Our room was beautiful and the toiletries in the bathroom are worthy of packing up with your luggage, but save some to use in the luxorious bathtub while you're there.  The beds were so comfortable and the decor was beautiful and frilly and antique.    There is a lot of history in this hotel which makes it fun to explore. The service at the hotel is outstanding.  Unfortunately we did not get to eat  at the world class restaurant downstairs but it smelled delicious and the courtyard seating looked so cute.    Guess I will just have to go back.  We went in January and it was great because the weather wasn't too bad and since it was the off season the city was pleasantly buzzing rather than annoyingly.  Check what's open during this tile thought because we weren't able to go on a boat because the company we chose wasn't running during this time.I found this hotel utterly charming and quaint.  The service by the bellman Eric was outstanding, he just wanted us to love the hotel as much as he did and made us feel welcomed and relaxed.  The room was plush, gorgeous bedding and I just love the 4 poster bed with the pineapple motif.  Not the normal stuff we get where I live by any means!  It's a small lobby with a wonderful staff.  I did hear noises that added to the 'ghost' experience but only on our first night.  The bathroom was luxurious - jetted tub and lighting was fabulous.  Would love to spend more time there.I rarely take the time to write a complaint about a poor experience, but after a recent stay at Planters Inn, I did.  This is not a four-star hotel.  I've had better service at a Hilton Garden Inn.  It's certainly not up to Relais &amp; Chateaux standards.  The staff was nice enough, but clearly too inexperienced and not thoroughly trained enough to provide first-rate guest service.  They had limited knowledge of nearby restaurants (""check out the menu book in our parlor""), persistent calls to our room which woke our infant daughter despite a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door, and LOUD noise from cars roaring by until 3AM on Saturday night.  I guess for noise reasons, their location is a blessing and a curse.  Location and nice room sizes are about the only thing this hotel has going for it - there are many other better options in Charleston.  I would never stay there again, but if it's the last room in town, ask to stay in room away from the street.PS - My written complaint was never really followed up by management - which for me is confirmation they really don't care.The staff knocks this place up a notch. It's right across from the Market in downtown Charleston - great location. The valet parking costs $18. Not sure what other choices are available. The room w/ king size bed is large w/ desk, loveseat style bench/couch, cushy bedding, huge bathroom. There's a nice sitting room on the street level w/ water, lemonade, etc. The bar was a great place for a cocktail and some oysters.I agree pretty much with the previous reviewer.  For anyone who knows real quality this is not the level of luxury you'd expect for this class of hotel and at this price point.  The location is excellent.  The lobby area is somewhat charming.  But we were housed in the rooms in the adjacent annex which (except for the four-post bed) were on par with an architecturally uninteresting mid-level hotel.  The room was odd and the hallways and stairwells were ropey.  I probably would not go back as it wasn't a good value for the money.  The staff were fine but definitely not a cut above.  The one request we made of the concierge (to arrange tickets to a house and garden tour) was that we'd have to do that ourselves. They were also too apt to recommend the other restaurants in Charleston that are owned by the same company that owns the hotel, as opposed to what they personally liked.  Overall good but not great.  For the money we paid it was a disappointment.",,,,"['2012', 'couple', 'days', 'company', 'hosted', 'incentive', 'trip', 'last', 'year', 'planter', 'inn', 'least', 'rooms', 'imagine', 'bill',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-charleston-dwtn-ashley-river-charleston,Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,3.5,$$,41,"Very comfortable stay! The front desk receptionist was very polite and greeting upon checking in (customer friendly).The bedroom was small yet comfortable. The bedroom balcony overlooks downtown Charleston (which was a nice morning view). Morning breakfast was tasty and filling (get off to a good start). Would recommend!Great location to downtown, less than 5 minutes either way. Parking is free, but pretty limited. Always have to drive around the lot a few times. Staff is really friendly and helpful about local aspects.The hotel quality and amenities are very good. The front desk staff are not customer service oriented. And because it's more than just one person, the leadership is clearly supporting a culture where the customer is a transaction. I was traveling on my motorcycle and there was a severe thunderstorm warning. I asked to park my bike under the front awning out of the way of vehicles needing to pass through. I was challenged with this request and was told shed check with her manager and get back with me--but never did. I'm on a 3,000 motorcycle trip, an IHG member who has been staying in a Holiday Inn Express all along the way (10 days), this was the only place that challenged me on parking there. The other places even encouraged me to just in case it might rain. Don't ask them about a phone charger to use either. They have a big box of lost and found and won't loan you a charger to use during your stay--not even for a few minutes. Not even if you are a Club member. There are other hotels nearby and I'd recommend you find one of them instead of this place. These people don't care about you. Just your money.As you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express. Speedy check-in, free parking which is nice in a downtown area and the general accommodations were mostly on point. 2 things---gym AC was in the blink which made for a great sweat but it was a bit much. They were working on it but, whew, was it hot!  AC in room was SUPER loud. Coworker said the same thing about their room. Hotel is new and it's always nice to stay in a newer property. Breakfast is also as expected. Nothing special but the general basic items you get at a HIE. Lots of good places within a mile to walk to for dinner. The area in general is under a revitalization and that is nice.Parking far, far away to the other side of the building!  The light in our bathroom, too noisy, since it also turns on the fan.  Bathroom too small, I don't like the tiny counter space, I'm using my desk to put my bathroom stuff, afraid they'd fall down the toilet!Tub no longer, updated to shower with 2 glass doors, a plus!I'll update tomorrow, after breakfast!Update: While we're the last ones to eat breakfast, before closing, I've come to observe the busboy.  He sprayed cleansers to the table, wipe them, with a rag, then he used the same rag to 'dust' the dirt or crumbs off the rug, to the floor.  Then he used  the same rag, to clean the table.  They also do not have hot cocoa!The room was adequate and the bed was comfortable. Parking is ample and secure. The location was just outside of the main town area. Traffic is heavy so it does take longer than you would expect to get to desired destination. There were some annoying construction noises nearby and a light shining on our window..the curtains helped some. Once during our stay there was a fire evacuation...apparently one of the guests tried to smoke in their room. Breakfast isn't bad but, there may be a wait at times for items to be replenished. Customer service was very good.Significantly below expectations for HI Express.  While I didnt expect a luxurious property, I was disappointed to find rooms that were dingy and dark (very limited light in the rooms), noisy due to doors slamming and exterior air handling machinery, and to top it all off 1/2 of the parking lot blocked off so there was no place to park.  This property is also not located in a convenient area of Chaleston.  right next to freeways so not walkable at all.Great value for the price and location.While it's not ""downtown"", it is about 1.5 miles (pretty walkable) or accessible by free trolly that picks up right outside the parking lot. It also has free parking and a great breakfast spread (fruits, juices, coffee, cinnamon buns, eggs, meats, yogurts, cereals, grits, oatmeals, and biscuits and gravy). They also have coffee/tea 24/7 as well as cookies they bring out mid-afternoon.You could tell it was recently renovated. The common areas and rooms were all a very modern Ikea-like style with dark wood, bold green colors, and patterns. The staff were very friendly and courteous. They didn't hesitate to explain to us about the free trolley, give us suggestions for dinner, and other sightseeing tips. They even gave us toiletries when the cleaning ladies seemed to have forgotten them.Don't, however, expect a very good view from the windows (unless you are above floor 5 on the odd side). You'll see a parking lot or construction or the highway. No biggie - we were just sleeping here.Well the heat was a bit noisy which woke me up at night and made it hard to watch TV. But other than that, I couldn't really pinpoint any major problems. I think we'd stay here again if we were in the area and didn't want to shell out $300+ for the Old Town 'quaint' experience.Stayed at this location last night and I honestly don't know how the negative comments can be justified. I am a Hilton diamond member and this hotel can be compared to any Hampton Inn. Typical breakfast food was fresh. The room was clean. The AC unit did run all night but did not bother us. I would stay again. The staff was extremely helpful and courteousWhile in the area on vacation, my mother was hospitalized and I needed a room for a night or two.  This hotel had a local number, so I called it and pressed 2 to reach the front desk. With no other information other than my name, they held a room for me.  I was treated like royalty upon arriving there after 9.  Dierdra at the front desk was a total gem and she even offered to move her car so I'd have a place to park!.  I was given a very clean and comfortable room and stayed there 2 night.  Breakfast buffet is better than many restaurants.  Plentiful coffee at all times, including a small pot in the room.  Everyone is nice and they even have a small laundry, but it is $2 each for the washer and dryer.  This is my first experience with a Holiday Inn Express, since I'm not much of a traveler, but I will definitely consider them my next trip.Good enough for the price. Good view facing the Ashley River. Room itself is alright: clean enough, roomy, adequate. A/C is rather noisy. The little Juliet balcony is a nice touch. Breakfast also adequate. Good free parking. In contrast to many reviews that say not convenient to downtown, I say it is convenient. Many Americans are no longer used to walking more than a few blocks and rely on motorized transport -- unhealthy loving. If you're used to living in a walking place like Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong, this type of walking is absolutely normal. We liked it.When reading reviews there was a mix that made it hard to decipher what this place was like.  My mother-in-law had been here once before and raved about their room so when we arrived and expected Awesomeness!  NOT!  We arrived to a disoriented front desk clerk and hand towels spread over counter and on the floor.  When you get the 7th floor and a 2 queen room, it's great; but if you get 4th floor with a king bed, be prepared for disappointment.  Rooms on 4 are dated and cramped and don't have mini fridge; rooms on 7 are spacious and have a fridge.    Horrible views and the rates are high, even though we had a discounted rate, and the housekeeping barely cleaned our room or made our bed.  Next time we will bring our RV and stay in Mount Pleasant.The hotel was nice...probably the cleanest hotel I ever stayed at.  I would love to stay there again for that reason.  Be careful of what they charge you.  I was quoted a price at the front desk.  I received my bill for the 4 days I stayed there at the end of my visit.  It was way way more than it should have been.  I took the bill down and the girl adjusted it.  I noticed after I had left the hotel that I was still overcharged by $40 dollars for two of the nights.  A slight overcharge is one thing, but double?  That is hardly excusable.Hotel itself is very nice and clean. The staff was ok. BIG downside was parking they have a very small parking lot if you happen to leave for dinner and come back you are lucky if you find a spot. Some people were parking in the grass.  Hotel is in a very busy place but it is in a convenient location easy to get to popular locations throughout Charleston.I am giving 4 stars overall for the hotel, but would give 5 stars if I could to one employee in particular.. Diedra at the front desk! As opposed to the ""night shift"" staff who was there when we checked in, Diedra greeted us with a smile in the morning and answered all of our questions about the Charleston area. She was also extra friendly to our dog, which always puts you at the top of the list in our book! She suggested specific areas for us to check out.. which all lived up to the hype! The hotel in general was nice, but since we visited right after a hurricane had the expected flooding/leaks/etc.We stayed here on an overnight to Charleston. It took less than 5 minutes to drive into downtown Charleston making this WELL worth the cost savings at not staying downtown. The room was very nice, modern, and bed very comfortable. We had a hard time regulating the temp though. Nothing would happen when I used the electronic gauge and only did something happen when my husband messed with the wall unit. Weird. The breakfast was basic but a nice to have. The parking lot was a bit of a cluster on a Sat night. We came back to the hotel around midnight and we got the last spot on the far other side close to the road. There were people parked at curbs.Other than that, great value and comfortable place to stay.Nothing special about this hotel. We had a pretty good rate through Hotwire, so no complaints there. The parking is free and plentiful which is nice. We didn't try to walk downtown or take the free trolley. Driving isn't bad at all to downtown. Meters don't run after 6 or on Sundays. The free breakfast was decent, but the healthy options might have been a bit lacking. This area did not have excessive noise at any time of the day. We did have an issue at midday on a Tuesday. We were trying to get ready for a wedding, but the front desk said a city water pipe broke and we were without water for over an hour. Nothing to really fault the hotel for, but I'm not sure if it will be an ongoing issue.The staff was always very friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. Wifi was slow but free.Great hotel! Rooms were clean and there was a nice mini-fridge to keep any food or drinks we wanted to keep. There was a great pool area with lounge chairs and tables for relaxing as well as a great patio on the front of the hotel to hang with friends after a long day out exploring.My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights and found it a perfect base for visiting the Charleston area. The hotel is 5-15 minutes from pretty much any place you might want to visit in the city as a tourist and 20-25 minutes to the beach, etc.  The hotel staff were very friendly and provided some great food recommendations. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable.The main parking lot gets difficult in the evenings, though you could always park in an adjacent lot of another business; not ideal but it's the only option given the lack of street parking.All Smoke and Mirrors. I stay in a lot of hotels, this one may have been remodeled recently, but feels like some time ago. As in 20yrs ago. Its beat up, next to the highway and tucked into a changing neighborhood thats still very seedy around it. If you do not want to spend money and be a ways from where all the action is happening in Charleston, this is where you go. We booked it based off reviews looking to save money on our last night. Wished we hadn't","I stayed here while on a business trip. I didn't do any of the booking so I can't comment on that or the pricing, but as a hotel I was very pleased and would aim to stay here again in the future.I was given a room with two queen beds. This also included a small table with two chairs, a coffee maker, a microwave, and fridge. Others I was staying with were given a king room that didn't have a fridge or microwave and commented that the room was small, so depending on what you want, be careful which room type you book. The main reason I was impressed with this hotel was the beds. I do not sleep well ever, and I REALLY don't sleep well in hotels, but the beds here were comfortable enough to rival mine at home, and each bed had soft and firm pillows (with soft and firm embroidered on the pillowcase) so you could chose what you like best. Wifi passwords were written on the hotel key envelops but I didn't use it at all. Others in my group mentioned watching netflix at night so they were obviously using the wifi no problem. The gym here had one elliptical, two treadmills, a rowing machine, some free weights, and some yoga mats and was very clean. The staff here was very friendly and the front desk provides extra amenities at no charge if you ask. I had forgotten toothpaste and they were able to provide me with a cute travel colgate. A continental breakfast was included in the price of the room which had your basic fruit, bagels, toast, cereal, as well as some ""higher end"" breakfast items such as pancakes, eggs, sausage, and cinnamon buns. I only ever ate the bananas so I can't comment on the food much. A word of advice for breakfast is to get there early. It begins at 6:30 am and I was there at that time most days; however, our last day checking out we walked through the lobby at 9 and breakfast was an absolute zoo.I am HI platinum elite, so I know something about Holiday Inns. 90 room nites in 2013 at the IHG hotel chain. This HI Express is well above the average and exceeded only by the one in Beckley WVA, near Tamarak. Free parking is so rare in Charleston as to rate one extra star all by itself. The breakfast was exactly the same menu as at all the rest, but extra attention was paid to detail. The biscuits were always fresh, I suspect they cook multiple small batches all morning rather than just a few big batches. The bed was quite comfortable, the AC worked fine, and the coffee was good.Special tips: get an odd numbered room on a floor above 5, and you can actually see the river.Set the AC fan to ON, rather than AUTO, and it will not cycle off and on all night. The compressor still cycles, but it's not as noisy.We were planning a last minute trip to Charleston for the weekend and every hotel downtown was wayyy out of budget - high season prices!We decided to take the Hotwire route and got this 3-star hotel for a good price. The location is convenient, maybe 5-10 minutes to drive into downtown or a 15 minute trolley ride. You can walk through the parking lot to catch the free city trolley (DASH). I believe they run every 20 minutes or so, but the hotel has maps at the front desk. This hotel also has free parking, so that's a big savings compared to downtown hotels.  The hotel is recently renovated, so everything is clean and modern. We were impressed that every staff member was so friendly and welcoming - everyone we saw throughout the hotel was smiling and saying hello to us. Very refreshing!Our room was also clean and modern, the bed was comfy and there was a new TV and a hairdryer in the bathroom (shower was also great, very hot, good pressure). There is safe in the room, but if the previous guest did not clear the code, you have to call to get it reset. The person who came to reset it for us was just as friendly as the rest of the staff and took care of it for us. Breakfast was included with our stay, it included: cereal, pancakes, eggs, biscuits, bacon, toast/muffins, yogurt, juice/coffee/milk. They also had bowls of fresh fruit throughout the eating area. It got really busy around 9-10, so make sure you go a little early to beat the rush. They were trying to keep up with everyone coming down at once, but they kept running out of the ""hot food."" We just went earlier the second day and it was fine. There isn't a bar or restaurant on site, but we checked out the rooftop bar next door at the Marriott one night - it was really nice (but pricey). Something for you to check out if you want to stay pretty close to your room.So that was all the good stuff. I only have one gripe about this place. The air conditioning unit was unbelievably loud. It woke me up every time it started to run. It sounds like a plane is taking off! If the management doesn't believe this complaint, they should try sleeping in room 810 one night. We were there with family and they said their air conditioning unit was just as loud as ours. So, if everything else convinces you to go here and you're a light sleeper - bring your ear plugs!!! I was wishing I had some every time that beast came on!Throw your GPS out the window.No matter what, it is hard to find the entrance to this place. Very poorly marked.The parking lot is small, and the front desk will warn you not to park in certain areas or else you'll get your car towed. Forget swimming in the pool before 1 or 2 o'clock, because the sun is blocked by the building until then.The beds are comfortable and the rest of the room is adequate. Not the fanciest hotel I've been to. The breakfast they serve is great. Good coffee, delicious cinnamon rolls, (not tried: cereal, pancakes, biscuits, fruit, orange juice, etc). Nice selection.  Very friendly and helpful staff.Wish they had a bar!Stayed last night, Memorial weekend...nice decor &amp; colors in lobby with wood floor/carpet combo....combination of earthy browns and cool aqua tones, in rooms as well.   Enjoyed front patio with chairs and tables, didn't get to the pool..as the sun doesn't hit that side until maybe noon.  There's a fitness center and business center as well.   Breakfast selection was just right and neatly arranged.  I loved the cute little  petite omelets neatly stacked in upright position.Staff was friendly, comfortable bedding and pillows..fyi..room with two queen beds have fridge/microwave combo...the kings do not.  Pay a little more and get the rooms with view which will have a balcony with Ashley River view.  I had a room with a limited view from the balcony and view of a roof next door and Mcdonalds...not pretty.What I noticed most was how soundproof the rooms are compared to most hotels I stayed in the past.  My room was close to the elevator, but it was not noisy and people walking by was barely a muffle.  I could not hear anything from the rooms beside me and the hotel was sold out this weekend.Holiday Inn Expresses include breakfast, but no restaurant or bar.  The kiosk in the lobby directs you to dining options in the area  and attractions.  We chose to drive a short distance away to the Holiday Inn Riverview atop the Ashley River and have dinner in their rooftop restaurant and bar which offers great food and a view of the Ashley River.Forgot my toothbrush and they gave me a complimentary one at the front desk.Good convenient location in the downtown area and fresh new look, clean...plush bedding and pillows.   A step up for an economy brand....oh and FREE parking...a rare thing in downtown Charleston!First time in Charleston.  Booked the hotel online, rates less pricey than the expensive historic district.   Ok, so the good:Very friendly, accommodating staff!Free breakfast, saves the cost of one meal per day.Again, cheaper rates.Could be better:Not convenient to the downtown Charleston . You have to take a shuttle or cab.  Shuttle runs erratic, none after 8:30pm. You can't walk, it's too far.The room we booked did not have a refrigerator.  The room was small and AC unit is very loud.Located near highways, so noisy all the time.After visiting Charleston next time will stay in the downtown area, just easier.Made my reservation by phone so I could be sure there would be a refrigerator in the room (because of medications) and to ask about leaving car there while going on a cruise. When I arrived there was a problem with the parking answer I'd been given. Wouldn't have been a problem at all except that the manager told me the conversation when I made the reservation ""never happened,"" constantly interrupted me, and yelled at me. There was no refrigerator, and when I asked for one, instead of just getting one, the desk clerk started lecturing me that rooms with king beds don't have them. The worst service, and rudest treatment I've ever received at a hotel. Choose a different Holiday Inn Express.This place is great! Super easy check in with friendly employees. This isn't a ""fancy"" hotel but being a moderate price it was what I was expecting. It's updated and modern. The ceilings are LOW but that's ok. There wasn't a refrigerator in our room (not sure if that goes for all rooms or what). Free wi-fi and free parking. This hotel is technically located ""downtown"" but it's not in the heart of the action so you'll probably have to drive to the downtown area (no sidewalks or anything). The pool is small and underwhelming but I can't imagine many people going there for the pool so you know.We stayed here for one night on a getaway to Charleston. My wife got a deal with an online booking, and off we went. Aside from the standard issue hotel stuff, this place doesn't really have anything revolutionary, which I didn't expect, but just worth noting. They offer free breakfast which is pretty extensive, cinnamon rolls, biscuits, eggs, bacon, gravy, fruit, yogurt, cereal, juice, bagels, the works. The bacon looked a little scary, but everything else was reasonable quality for free. The rooms are nice, clean, and have reasonable sized bathrooms, some even have small balconies. Location was nice, it's almost exactly 1 mile from ""downtown"". If it weren't for the terrible rainy/cold weather we likely would have just walked, since parking is a huge inconvenience in Charleston. Only reason I gave this place 4/5 is because while everything is fairly new, it just seemed like they rushed the construction, so they cut some corners on the way. Just small stuff like uneven caulking, rough edges on trim, and some cheap appliances. But hey, it's just a hotel, nothing worth getting upset over. If I stay overnight in Charleston again, I wouldn't be opposed to here. It's nice to not be all the way downtown, and it's reasonably priced.After we booked this room through an online service we realized that is was on the outer edge of their ""downtown"" envelope.  I doubt that many visitors would consider this hotel to be ""downtown.""  It is a good 1.5 miles from the visitor center and another mile from the area around, and north of, the battery.  There is very little that you can walk to from the hotel except for a McDonalds.  Charleston does run a free shuttle bus down to the visitor center from this area.  I understand that the trip takes about a half an hour.  We intended to take the shuttle, but the day was cold and damp, with a misty rain, and when the shuttle did not arrive within ten minutes of the scheduled time, we decided to get out of the rain and drive to the visitors center, which took less than ten minutes, but then we had to pay for parking.The rooms and bathrooms are not very large and are very tight.  We ran out of tissues in the bathroom and they left a new box sitting on the sink rather than in the dispenser.  Toiletries that were used were not replaced, and the used tea bags were not replaced.  The bed was very comfortable.One of the benefits listed for this venue is free parking, but the lot is not large enough for a busy night, and many of us had to be creative one evening in carving out spots for our cars.  The hotel is also situated next to a busy highway, so there is a lot of highway noise at all hours of the day and night.  When we asked at the desk for restaurant recommendations nearby, they were less than useful and did not come up with anything except the nearby fast-food establishments.  There are some good restaurants less than a mile from the hotel, but with bad weather we needed to drive.  The local neighborhoods have very little parking, so you need to be prepared to drive around for a bit.The free breakfast is typical of this sort of hotel and is not bad.  The breakfast food staff were excellent in insuring they did not run out of food, and in clearing tables as people finished their breakfasts.Needless to say, I would not stay there again and would not recommend the Holiday Inn Express Charleston ""Downtown"" - Ashley River.Front desk staff has been great..room..great..pool great.. My only complaint is not all the TV stations work other than that the room is  clean the staff is professional.. And went beyond the norm to satisfy my needs can't wait to stay here againThis hotel opened recently (March 2013) and some things look amazing (clean bedding, fresh paint) but other things look like your average, older, cheaper hotel (shower/bathroom, ac unit) plus there's still paint on door frames/etc. It was previously a Best Western, hence the old stuff. But the staff was very friendly and the lobby inviting and clean.When we arrived to check in to our room, we were told that they gave our room away to someone else and tried to give us a single bed and a roll away cot. We had already booked and paid for a room that had two beds. After telling the front desk person that we needed two beds since there were 3 adults and 1 child, they remembered that there was 1 room left that had two beds. The room they gave us was made for a disabled person to be able to use easily.., This would not have been an issue at all, but the shower is not user friendly at all. The shower head does not stay mounted on the holder and the standing shower did not hold any water in. By the time you are done with your shower, half of the bathroom is soaked. Also the fridge that came with our room was broken and the air conditioning unit did a crappy job of keeping our room cool. It was set at 66 degrees and made our room feel like it was around 75 or so. Also they have more rooms than they do parking spots.... We were told to make up our own parking spot. For the money that we spent here and all the hotels I've stayed in, this was one of the worse ones.Walls are paper thin. Take something to help you sleep because the street noise and the conversation from the next room will keep you awake. On the plus side, very helpful front desk staff and convenient location. Would think twice before staying at this location again.This hotel just opened this year, so it's nice and clean. The breakfast is pretty decent, but the eggs were so salty they were inedible. The staff was super helpful and the rooms were clean and spacious. The only complaint on the rooms was that they use a super noisy A/C unit that looks like it time traveled from the 1980's to get there. It was RIDICULOUSLY noisy! For a Holiday Inn Express it wasn't too bad. There is a nice pool (no stairs into the pool, just ladders, which is kind of weird). I stayed here free using my reward points, but I don't think I'd pay to stay here.Nice hotel, clean.  Close to the medical complex and ball field.  Nice fitness room.  Outside pool, we didn't try it.  Not right in the tourist district but there is a bus a few blocks away.Stayed here during a recent trip.  It was our first time to Charleston and we were really excited.  The Hotel  had everything you would need at a great price.  The complimentary breakfast every morning was great.  We did have one issue with the room.  However Rebecca the GM handled the situation very quickly and professionally.  She ensured that we will continue to stay at her Hotel whenever we are in Charleston.Thanks RebeccaBy holiday inn standards this location is inferior. Yes its a quick drive to downtown and you're thinking you'll save some money... But at what point is it worth it. This place isn't cheap but your room certainly feels like it. So small my wife and I bumped into each other and the walls constantly. So dark you can't even get shave or apply makeup in the bathroom. Better off researching other places.I had a great stay here last weekend. The staff was so friendly and helped me out on a couple of occasions. I was in a room with 2 beds and it was clean and there was plenty of room in the room, the bathroom was a little small though. There was a fridge in the room which was helpful. I didn't think much of the hotel until after I left and realized I left an item in the room. Jackie was able to help me out in a professional timely manner, which I am so thankful for.Similar to many of the other posts, I travel weekly so as a IHG Platinum Member I have seen my fair share of HI's.   This experience was during a family vacation using some rewards points and I was told that our room on the 5th floor had a ""view""...of the other hotels maybe...but certainly not a water view.  I can get past that but obviously the hotel was booked solid every night causing many to park on the lawn or in the gravel lot next door that turns into a pond every night when it rains and then finally having to park 2 lots away because we came in later.   I might even look past that but to make things worse, each morning there was a long line for breakfast because they ran out of food several days in a row and even ran out of regular coffee....how does this happen this is your business? The staff was friendly that's why I give at least 2 stars but it seriously makes me reconsider where I stay in the future.  The bathroom was tiny,  the balcony door handle and lock were broken, and they do not offer pay per view family movies.  Very disappointed in a place that I've come to expect a great experience each time.","Just returned from 5 day vacation in Charleston.  This facility offers very good value.  Nearby trolley stop to downtown.  The staff deserves a five star rating.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/french-quarter-inn-charleston,French Quarter Inn,5.0,$$$,58,"Spoiled and pampered for 3 days, it will be difficult to readjust and return to our real lives tomorrow. The French Quarter Inn was a splurge for us, and was it ever worth it.SERVICE:  What an awesome staff. Everyone from the bell boys, check in agents, cleaning staff, food service employees, and manager were all excellent, attentive and genuinely kind and amazing. Can't say enough about how welcome we felt.FOOD AMENITIES:  Breakfast was large bowls of fresh berries or melons with pineapple,  cereal,  greek yogurt,  mini quiches, pastries, salami, cheese, bread and bagels, even with smoked salmon and capers today. Beverage choices of fresh juices, champagne,  coffees, and different teas with various honeys, lemon milk,  cream and sweeteners. Wine and cheese reception was abundant  with pinot grigio, chardonnay, merlot, or cabernet. At least 3 cheese were offered each day, salami, olives, garlic, fig jelly, dried fruit, grapes, bread and crackers. In the evening, we gorged on homemade cookies and port, skipping the cold milk offering. Throughout the day, coffees, teas, water, lemonade and treats such as m&amp;ms and jelly beans were offered 24/7.  This doesn't even include the treats at turndown service in your room or the complimentary waters which were replenished daily. OTHER AMENITIES: Bikes are complimentary and available for cruising around town. Unfortunately, it was cold and windy so we were unable to take advantage of this during our stay. There is a nearby gym available for use during your stay, just ask.ROOM: We graciously accepted a complimentary upgrade from queen room to queen suite. Wow...Huge spacious area with additional sitting room and fireplace. The bathroom also had a great shower and garden tub with bath salts to relax. Large towels and comfy bath robes were also luxurious, as were the Bigelow bath products.  The beds were comfortable and they actually have 7 pillow options and a concierge if you wish a specific type. NEGATIVES ???: We did have a problem with our room during our last evening which necessitated us to change rooms. Can you believe that the manager,  Mark, actually drove in from home to speak directly with us and make sure that everything was okay? He even adjusted our bill and gave us his card to assist us with reservations for our next stay. Even the next morning,  he found us and apologized again for the inconvenience and thanked us for being understanding. Wow! Again,  the customer service is amazing. We are about to leave this heavenly place, but can't wait to return to Charleston. Of course,  we will definitely be staying at the French Quarter Inn! !! Thanks to all who made our stay amazing!A comfortable and well thought out hotel. You can't beat the location next to the market. Anise checked us in with champagne and an explanation of all their extras. Breakfast, wine and cheese in the early evening and port with warm cookies later. The room was large with a great bathroom and big shower. We could have had a choice of 7 pillow types, but ours were fine. Everyone we came in contact with was outstanding.This place is very expensive but worth every penny if you can afford it.  We were here for our wedding and they treated us like movie stars.  The suite we got was incredible and very clean.  Most importantly for me it was also very nice and cool in the southern heat ;)The women that work at the front desk really go the extra mile to help you out with whatever you need and they are a gold mine of ideas for fun things to do locally.  I'd really recommend getting a room with a balcony if you can, we did and it was a lot of fun setting outside in the morning before it got too hot just watching the tours and tourists going by while you eat a delicious breakfast and take in the cool, sea breeze.  Highly recommended!Terrible start to our Christmas.  After many hours of driving we arrived only to be told our room would not be ready as promised by the 4pm check in time.  I had several teenagers that needed showers to get ready for dinner and we missed our first dinner reservation as a result.  While apologetic, there is no excuse for the substantial delays we encountered.This was pretty out of our norm in terms of hotels we frequent with kids. However, that was exactly the point of this trip. I wanted to take the kids to a place that wasn't Disney World or the beach for once. I wanted them to experience the history and culture of a great city such as Charleston. There was only one small hiccup, which was having to ask for pillows three times in 5 hours for the pullout. The king suite was charming. The best thing about this hotel is the location and the service. The breakfast, wine and cheese in the evening, and milk and cookies at night had us sold! The bellhops were very nice and helpful. I'd definitely stay here again.What a wonderful place! Here for my mother's Bday and it's exactly what I thought it would be based on photos and reviews. The service from Valet, Front Desk, and the Reception was exceptional. We still have one more night to go and wish it was longer, what a treat.This was one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in. I came here with my daughter for her Birthday and some mommy daughter time. The visit started with the reservation desk offering us a glass of champagne, a pillow menu, and wine and cheese reception every late afternoon. Bed turndown every night with a sweet treat. The staff is amazing and always meeting your needs! Will definitely come back!PROS:-Amazing front desk service, both a place to check in and for great concierge service -Who doesn't love included breakfast with cereal, fresh granola, bagels, quiche, fruit, coffee, fresh juices, mim. osas!?-Cheese/wine reception was nice and the late night cookies are a good touch-Fabulous location in the French Quarter, easy walking distance to amazing restaurants (my favorite of which was Husk) and less than a block away from the marketCONS:-Unadvertised demolition in Sept / Oct 2014 (unclear end date) with expected noise as there is drilling on the ground floor and guests sleep on floors 1,2,and 3. -Housekeeping was spotty, we once requested they come after 5 PM (per their protocol!) and they never came. No fresh towels even!-No hot food at breakfast, no scrambled eggs or meats-If you actually think about it, this place somehow has a great rating while hosting basically NO basic amenities. There is no pool, not even a gym.-Incorrect times for the meals are presented to you in the room booklets. It says breakfast runs until 11:30 on the weekends but we were disappointed to find no food left when we came down at 10:35.We had an issue with the renovation noise (drilling at 7:30 AM!) and discussed with the acting manager Scott. He offered us a worse room on a lower floor, next to the breakfast service and closer to noise on the street. I felt frustrated to be treated like this but he seemed to think that offer (which was graciously refused) fixed the problem. I considered cutting my stay short but was so busy I didn't want to deal booking another hotel. I spoke to him later and he was determined to make things right which I appreciated. This hotel certainly has a strong sense of customer service.Overall this hotel has great front desk service, a great breakfast, and an amazing location but is not worth over $350/night given the lack of luxury amenities. Also, I would strongly recommend phoning ahead to make sure there is not drilling during your stay. Will be trying elsewhere (maybe Wentworth mansion?) when I return to Charleston in a few months!Attention to detail is a trait lost on many hotels these days, but not the French Quarter Inn. This is one of the best (if not the best) hotel says I've ever had. Check-in went quickly and smoothly and started with a glass of champagne for my wife and I. We were upgraded to a corner room with a terrace - a pleasant surprise, though unfortunately it was too cold in January to really take advantage of it. The wine and cheese reception takes place daily from 5:30-6:30. No, the cheeses are not exotic or all that different from what you could buy at the supermarket, but overall the service was good and the wine enjoyable. By 8:30 they've switched to milk and cookies before bed. Grab a glass of Port and take it up to your room which has since been turned down.Complementary breakfast in the morning can either be enjoyed in the lobby or room service can deliver it to your room. We tried room service the first morning and went down the second. Room service is certainly very convenient, but you get a better selection if you go down to the lobby (including mimosas). The food is as good as I would expect from any continental breakfast. Other things I enjoyed about FQI... the restrooms on the main floor had actual linens rather than paper towns or air dryers. The rooms have Blu Ray players and they keep a cabinet of discs down in the lobby (no outrageous $20 pay-per-view movies here). There are bicycles available for guests who want to ride around the peninsula.And of course... LOCATION! This is one of the most centrally located hotels in Charleston. Across the street from the City Market and walkable to just about anything you would want to do on the peninsula. French Quarter Inn looks pricey on paper but the value is definitely there. I'm already planning a trip to return next year.For weeks I searched for the perfect hotel to spend a few days with my husband and 4 year old son before our new born arrived, so I was looking for comfort, location, amenities and price. I could not have chosen the best hotel ever.On the day of our departure, our town got hit with 13 inches of snow, and I was determined to get away for the weekend. When I spoke with Ashley about my options she was helpful and courteous. At no time was she rude about their cancellation policy. Based on her excellent customer service, I was very motivated to make it to Charleston, SC.We arrived to the French Quarter Inn much later than we had expected because of inclement weather and traffic, but Mr. Gil was absolutely wonderful with checking us in. He offered me cookies and milk (being 8 months pregnant, I could not drink) and my husband got his glass of champagne and cookies. He helped us with our luggage and ensuring that we settled right into our hotel room. He even came back up to our room to help us figure out how to manage the television remote. Mr. Gill also told us about the breakfast option where we could order our breakfast food to our room as opposed to going downstairs for the over the top breakfast each morning. I cannot express enough how this options was a God send for me. Again, being 8 months pregnant, I cannot move as fast, and I did not feel like getting up early to get ready just to grab breakfast for my boys. This option was AWESOME to say the least, because I actually could enjoy my vacation by not having to grab breakfast, but having it delivered to our room each morning. My recommendation: Moms, take advantage of this option :)Michelle was also very helpful in providing information about possible tours and other sightseeing options around Charleston. I would bug her day or night and she was always very pleasant, accommodating and knowledgeable about what I could find around town. My recommendation: Always call the front desk or stop by because they may have coupons that you could use for local sightseeing tours, restaurants or other venues in or around Charleston.The cheese and wine reception: EXCELLENT!!! Anna and Linda were always very nice and helpful. There was something for everyone to eat, even my 4 year old. What was nice about this reception was the variety of food and drink, so it was not limited to only drinking adults. Kids and pregnant women were included when they came up with the menu option for the cheese and wine reception.  I can honestly say that the beds were very comfortable. And turn down service was very nice and they always came with a special treat: Home-made chocolate and water.  The bathroom was roomy, the showers were awesome, and the amenities included with the bathroom were excellent. The hotel in general was clean. The staff was courteous and helpful. All the staff would made sure to acknowledge you and greet you, even my 4 year old, which was nice to see because old southern charm is still alive in the south. Overall, I would give the French Quarter Inn FIVE stars for their excellent service and wonderful amenities. I was so impressed with this establishment, I plan to return once the baby is a few months old, but my goal is to stay at their sister hotel in the fall: The Harbor View Inn.Thank you for reading my review and recommendations.Our honeymoon was wonderful and this hotel is out of this world! Everyone was so nice and always available to help. I will say that my husband and I are in our early 40's and were the youngest people staying here. This is more of an elegant, quiet hotel if that's what your looking for :)Was here in June 2015. One of the best hotels I had stayed in. Was in balcony room on third floor. Service and attentiveness to detail were great.  Room was fantastic. Bed was super comfortable and shower had awesome pressure. Location was perfect right in middle of old Charleston. Only thing I might improve is quality of the breakfast.  Would definitely come back if I returned to Charleston.This place is amazing!! The staff are very friendly and are their for your best experience-This is what customer service should be. Wished we could stay longer. The front staff were professional and smart, and helpful.  Glori took care of us making sure we enjoyed our stay. Wel loved this hotel and we will be back. Thank you so much for making our short trip special. Such nice staff.  Thank youThis is one of the best hotels anywhere.  It has a perfect location.  The rooms are lovely.  The new bathrooms are large with plenty of storage.Michelle and Scott went out of their way to accommodate us wh en we requested a larger room facing the street.Don't even think of staying anywhere else.Top quality all around. Excellent service. So many places could learn a few things from the service and attention to detail here. Expensive but worth it. Don't forget there is no pool.Stayed twice here now.  Absolutely love it!  The service is top notch.  A hotel that you simply enjoy all that it has to offer.  Great quaint seating areas to enjoy all their specialty services, such as wine and cheese or evening cookies and milk.  Wonderful patios.  Turn down service with treats!  Gorgeous hotel in the heart of Charleston within walking distance to everything!  Our favorite hotel world-wide hands down!I won't get into detail but this place is top shelf.  No reason to stay anywhere else.Everything is the way it should be and you will have a great stay.We look forward to our next trip.The only place to stay at in Charleston if you're looking for a luxury hotel.The service is amazing. Champagne on arrival. Wine and cheese every night. Cookie and milk at night time. Breakfast included every morning. The rooms are elegant and bathrooms updated. Service from check in to checkout flawless. I've stayed at Charleston Place which is also a nice hotel. The FQI is on another level. comparable or better than ritz and four seasons. If you go to Charleston and want a nice hotel stay here.Stayed here for the second half of my Charleston trip and loved the service here. The staff went above and beyond with their customer service. The front desk always referenced me by my name and the wine/cheese servers remembered my wine preference and would fill up my glass without being asked. I also go upgraded to a suite room overlooking the market. The hibiscus water in the lobby was so refreshing after walking outside and the jelly beans were a cute touch. It was a wonderful experience and would recommend it to anyone looking for an intimate hotel.I have never been so taken care of at a hotel. The staff gave impeccable service, even sending two women in at once to clean the room and turndown the beds in record time. The amenities provided are just delightful - champagne and lady fingers upon arrival, Wine and cheese before dinner time, cookies and milk later in the evening, and coffee and tea whenever you want it. Everyone on staff was so friendly and really seemed to genuinely care about each customer. And we were given an upgrade to our room, which was so lovely with a colonial French decor. I highly highly recommend this hotel. It is worth every extra penny.","It is always the details that make a place like French Quarter Inn excellent. I was a bit skeptical, and I didn't keep my hopes up before arrival. I've stayed at many supposedly great hotels and got dissapointed more times than I can remember. Maybe it was my low-set expectations or the great service (actually great everything!) at French Quarter Inn that made our trip to Charleston excellent. Hotel doesn't look ""grand"" from outside. However the interior is fresh and clean. You can see the Southern influence in the decor , but it is not overwhelming by any means. The check-in was smooth. We were upgraded to a room with a terrace overlooking the market and offered a glass of champagne (just like everyone else). Our room was quite big. Again, we were upgraded, so I think we got one of the bigger rooms in the hotel. I usually don't care much about the size or decor since I am not even there most of the day, however it was great to know that we were going to come back to a great room after walking around all day long.Breakfast is complementary. They can even bring it to your room w/o any additional charge. We thought we would utilize the nice terrace just for that purpose. They have everything you can ask for: eggs, salmon, bagels, pastries, etc. You won't need to go outside for breakfast.As most other reviews have already mentioned, there are drinks and snacks in the lobby area throughout the day. We didn't attend the wine and cheese reception, however we definitely utilized the homemade lemonade and iced tea.What I really liked about FQI and the main reason I will be back is the great staff. Even if you are not feeling good for some reason, they will make you smile. You can stay at a great hotel with rude staff, and you probably won't be back. You can stay at a mediocre hotel with good staff. You may not stay there again, but you won't regret your decision. You can stay at FQI where you will get great service in an amazing setting, you will be back for sure.There is simply no better place to stay in Charleston.  We have tried other hotels but now just automatically book a room here because we are never disappointed. From the champagne welcome at the desk, to nightly wine and cheese, immaculately appointed and clean rooms, robes, turn-down service, great breakfast, and friendly bell staff, you can't go wrong.  Can't wait till the next visit!We stayed at the French Quarter Inn for our 30th wedding anniversary and were 100% pleased.  From the moment we arrived, we were met with wonderful hospitality.  Check in was a breeze, our room was beautifully appointed.  The balcony had a lovely view of the bridge.  We were gifted with delicious chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of Proseco.  The valet was as pleasant and helpful as can be.  Delicious nightcap along with fresh-baked cookies closed a beautiful evening.  We highly recommend it and would go back next time we visit the area.  A truly terrific experience.I never understood how someone could live in a hotel for any extended period of time.After spending several days at the French Quarter Inn, not only did I completely understand the draw and desire, we were ready to move in.Exceptional service  from manager to front desk to maids to valets with rooms that are amazing.From the different snack services throughout the day to the coffee and tea service on every floor to the turn down service, your little belly will never be without a friend.Seriously, we loved the FQI so much that, if wasn't available, we'd change our travel so we could stay there again.We absolutely could not imagine a better hotel for us!  We love high quality and hate stuffy and pretentious.  FQI is highest quality and truly exceptional, but not stuffy at all!  I can't praise the staff enough, from front door to maid service.  I now that I an gushing, but this hotel is really that exceptional!  Yes, it is expensive, but it has value to match and exceed the cost!  We look forward to our next visit.We can't wait to go back and stay at the French Quarter Inn again!  This hotel is phenomenal and the staff gets 5 stars!  We were greeted by a friendly front desk staff who offered us a glass of champagne upon arrival. After our car was valet parked, our bags were brought to our room for us. We took advantage of the pillow concierge and had luxury pillows brought to the room. It is an exceptionally clean hotel as well. The bathrooms are very large and the shower is large enough for more than one. :) The breakfast is complimentary and has croissants, cheese, fruits, bagels, coffee, juices, and of course, champagne. We will most definitely go back. We booked through Hotel Tonight, so our room that originally cost $319 per night was only $199. What a great deal!!Full disclosure:  we did not stay here.  Instead, we got caught in a storm today and the carhop downstairs was really sweet and conversational while we waited for a dry moment to duck out.  30 minutes later, when we realized there wasn't going to happen any time soon, we went inside to find a gift shop where we hoped to find an umbrella to purchase.  The hotel is BEAUTIFUL and stately, but the key here is the service.  Knowing we weren't staying at the hotel, the concierge gave us two complimentary umbrellas and offered to lend me her rain boots, simply asking that we drop them off when we were finished.  How sweet!  True Southern hospitality, and I know where we are staying next time we visit Charleston...Stayed for 3 days in April 2014. Location great. Accommodations very nice. But the sales pitch on web site makes this Inn out to be a four star hotel which it is not. Service is what segregates the good from the great. The champagne upon check in? Front desk forgot, we had to ask for it. We changed rooms after first day as scheduled (availability issue, nothing to do with Inn) and were told they would call when new room ready. Never received call. This is not the service of a four star hotel. There are several other apparently comparable hotels in same area in historic downtown area. Suggest you look at price. We paid almost $500 per night for the larger patio room. Oh, TV not high def.The Hotel is very classy. We had a very good experience. My husband and I flew in from NY for our son's Navy nuclear power school graduation.  The hotel is clean and very friendly.  Loved all the special treats like the great buffet breakfast and the champagne for Mimosas every morning. Also, the champagne at check-in, and the wine and cheese in the afternoon.  All the employees that we came in contact with were pleasant, friendly and professional. They seemed to really care about making our stay special.  The manager Scott helped us out by getting us special reservations at one of Charleston's best restaurants. (we were remiss in not placing reservations in advance). Scott was available every day and would make a point to seek us out to see how we were enjoying our stay.  The valet car parkers were genuinely concerned for our well being and always offered good suggestions.  I especially liked the breakfast server I think her name was Cindy. When  I mentioned that the hot water was not as hot as I usually like it for tea she went back and brought a carafe of boiling hot water.  This is how a hotel should operate. The big name hotels should operate like The French Quarter.Outstanding!  Wonderful hotel in every sense.  Location - fabulous.  right on the market, walk to everywhereHotel - the happy, friendly staff really made my stay wonderful.  Every member offered assistance (w/o asking), jumped right in when asked and couldn't have been any more hospitable.  From the front desk, housekeeper, bellmen, servers - everyone.  My family stayed recently for a reunion type weekend.  We had @ 10-15 rooms.  All of my guests said the same thing.  Love, love this hotel.  The rooms &amp; bathrooms are nice too,  Comfy beds. Every aspect of the hotel and more importantly its staff are exceptional.  Definite stay in Charleston.I can't say enough wonderful things about French Quarter Inn. The staff is friendly, the facilities are charming, the rooms are very comfortable, and the little extras they offer really make a difference. The Inn is located in the heart of Historic Charleston and is a short walk to some of the best restaurants and historic homes and museums. My family and I stayed at the Inn for 3 nights in July 2013 which was just the right amount of time for what we wanted to see and do in the Charleston area. The room had two really comfy queen beds which was great after having stayed at earlier hotels in Washington, D.C. and North Carolina which only had double beds. The free WiFi was a nice plus as well.Every morning, we awoke to a wonderful breakfast downstairs where we could choose to eat indoors or outdoors on the patio (we also had the option of having breakfast brought up to our room). We could choose from organic Greek yogurt with fresh fruits, an assortment of very good breads and pastries (not the dry and processed-tasting types that you get at lower-end hotels), warm quiches, lots of fruits and delicious juices (my favorite was the grapefruit juice which is saying a lot because I normally don't like grapefruit juice). When we would return to the hotel in the middle of the day, we'd re-energize with the coffee, tea, lavender lemonade, and ""detox water"" that's available 24/7 as well as the endless supply of M&amp;M's and Jelly Belly's. Every night, there was warm, homemade cookies and milk to help us slumber that much better. Although the Inn was undergoing construction (remodeling the bathrooms), we weren't bothered or inconvenienced by the work. The staff would great about leaving us letters in our room with information about the construction work that day that may impact us. I have no reservations in recommending that you stay at French Quarter Inn.Absolutely adore this hotel from the charming and gracious staff to the delicious food. The breakfasts, wine and cheese reception and cookies and milk are enough food for the whole day......but of course we didn't stop there, there's too much good food in Charleston. It's in a great location by the Market, King Street and Museum Mile. Would definitely come back on our next visit.   Oh.....and the glass of champagne upon check-in and the free bicycle rental.....lovely touches you don't find many places!!!!freebies all day long, staff was great. we got in room massages too! Would definitely go back, location was perfect.Oh man, this place is fantastic!I came to Charleston to attend a wedding with my parents and my dad picked French Quarter Inn for our two night stay. The hotel itself is very beautiful and clean. There are only 3 or 4 floors in the entire building, so it feels a little more quaint that most hotels. It's also in a walkable area, so you don't have to worry about getting your car from the valet.One thing I really enjoyed about French Quarter Inn was all the amenities offered to guests. When you check in they offer you a glass of champagne (I'm definitely a fan of this!). In the early evening they have wine and cheese and later in the evening they offer milk and cookies. Coffee, tea and lemonade are always available in lobby and there is coffee and tea available on each floor from 6am to 10pm (I believe).Everyone from the front desk to the valet to the maids were very friendly. The atmosphere here is great and I would gladly stay here again!We check in early so our rooms were not ready.  But Jennie was great and assured us our rooms would be ready by three and they were.  She was very personable, remembered our names and gave us a great dinner suggestion after we told here where we had made reservations for our 3 day trip.The hotel is in the historic district about two blocks from the water but it is centrally located.Upon check in they give you a glass of champagne.Our room at 250.00 per night was large.  It had a private balcony, computer, refrigerator, flat screen TV, table and two chairs.The air-conditioning worked properly along with a ceiling fan.The bathroom was large and clean.The room was updated, clean and had good furnishings.The hotel itself was top notch, clean, a lot of public seating areas and the staff was friendly and attentive.They served a cold breakfast, along with wine and cheese at night and cookies and milk in the evening.Coffee and tea are available in the room hallways all day  along with lemonade and other juices in the lobby.This place is well worth the money for the quality of rooms, amenities, staff and location.Give it a try.Best...hotel... ever.  This is right in the heart of downtown Charleston.  It's a boutique hotel, so a lot of interesting amenities are included like a pillow menu, breakfast, wine and cheese reception in the afternoon, snacks all day and milk and cookies at night.Everything about this hotel was stellar.  We arrived at least 2 hours before check in but they had a room available immediately.  The room was clean and spacious with a computer with free internet!  Maybe I just don't stay in hotels that often, but I have never been to a hotel that has complimentary internet access in every room.The wine and cheese hour is delightful, especially when spent outside on the beautiful patio.  There is a large array of different wines, a few different types of cheese, crackers and fruit.  Champagne and lady fingers are also available.The milk and cookie hour wasn't spectacular, but hey, it's free milk and cookies.  Good enough for me.Part of the reason my trip to Charleston was so wonderful was because of this hotel.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat.We stayed at the French Quarter Inn during our weekend in Charleston and it was very nice. We had a huge suite and they had a lot of thoughtful amenities that were perfect. The location could not have been better. It is right on Market street and our NOLA style balcony overlooked all the action. Our suite had a living room, big bathroom, huge bedroom, ceiling fans, fridge, plasma TVs, safe, iron and board and lots of storage space. I really liked having all that space and you can't beat the balcony, you may want to upgrade for it. The FQI had fresh coffee on every level. They also had coffee, tea, lemonade and water in the lobby at all hours. Breakfast was included with our package, which were bagels, muffins, pastries and fruit. There are a lot of beautiful outdoor spaces and patios where you can relax. Cheese and wine tastings are complimentary every evening. Milk and cookies were laid out each night. The lobby also had jelly beans and m+ms for the sugar fix. While it was nice, there is still room for improvement. Our AC broke down one night, which left our room quite stuffy. We also had to ring the phone off the hook and basically wake someone up to check us out and get our car to make our morning flight. Not something I want to deal with on a travel day.The bridesmaids selected this hotel for the bachelorette. We had a suite for 4 women and it was perfect with the balcony and sitting room.  There was plenty of space.  There was also a pillow buffet but the ""gourmet"" pillow selections weren't very impressive and even oddly shaped.  However, I digress.I loved the patio that we could relax with wine and snacks later in the evening and it overlooked the market.  The Inn also served a continental breakfast and delivered it to your room for free.  Champagne and lady fingers, a cheese and wine reception, and warm cookies and milk?, each day. The concierge and bellhops were super helpful and nice.The Inn does not have a pool, but that's alright.The Inn is located in a centralized location and is therefore in a good walking distance to the touristy destinations and historic downtown. Overall, I loved it and this definitely added to a wonderful bachelorette weekend!Very nice hotel. Stayed here for work several weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Living in mtp I wasn't sure if it was really ""worth it"" but since it was the company's dime...who cares..the room was well appointed and pretty typical for any 5 star business hotel. But for a pure traveler, you can't beat the locale being in the heart of downtown Charleston amongst all the restaurants and such. Also, take care of the hotel staff and they'll take care of you, assuring your visit is complete. Make sure to step outside the hotel and take in Charleston's historic nightlife as well.Absolutely great spot to vacation or stay for business.Fantastic place to stay while you're in Charleston. My wife and I had our honeymoon in Charleston and we stayed at the French Quarter Inn. Besides being greeted with a bottle of champagne, having a breakfast of pastries brought to your room, a mid-day wine and cheese, and the evening having cookies and milk (all offered free of charge, by the way), the hotel is incredibly accommodating. It's the first place I've been that has a ""Pillow Concierge"" that can offer more pillows than I knew existed. The location of the hotel is also pretty key - it's within (a very short) walking distance from some of Charleston's best restaurants, tourist sites, and venues. The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming, the room was very nice and was spic and span every day. As far as pricing goes, it is on the higher end, but it is well worth it.","Fabulous hotel in the city of Charleston. Warm and well run this clean hotel is near everything a visitor could want. The front desk staff was friendly and very welcoming. We were greeted with champagne and an upgrade which was available at the time. Morning continental breakfast is very convenient as is the wine, cheese, fruit and crackers server in the afternoon. Just a great over all experience. I travel often and this place is a hands down winner. Also super quiet to sleep and coffee bar in the hallway is nice touchThe room, service and amenities at French Quarter Inn were excellent. Staff were extremely friendly and not just willing to do whatever we needed, but they consistently anticipated our needs to make our stay more special in a way that was attentive, but not intrusive.  For example, champagne/wine on arrival, staff walking across the lobby to light the fireplace in front of us when my wife and I sat to sip some wine and enjoy the atmosphere.  Staff provided excellent recommendations for restaurants and bars. Bathrooms are notable: large, luxurious and immaculate. We can't wait for our next visit to Charleston and we will definitely stay at the French Quarter Inn.  Everything was beyond our expectationsWe stayed there a while ago but it was nice, the location is great for access to Charleston. The look and feel of the hotel is elegant yet quaint (not another chain hotel). When we where there they had a wine and cheese hour right after dinner time and they had little gatherings throughout the day. The staircase is beautiful and the service was top notch. If you are coming into town a great place to stay.Parking was an issue. They have a valet service which you will need to use otherwise good luck.Absolutely wonderful. It's the only place to stay in Charleston. Can't wait to stay at the French Quarter Inn on our next trip to Charleston.My fiance was adamant that I give French Quarter a five-star yelp review as soon as we got home.  We loved our stay at this hotel.  Centrally located, you can walk everywhere in Charleston.  You are greeted with a glass of champagne upon check-in and have a wine and cheese reception every afternoon on the veranda.  Our room was beyond spacious.  The staff was amazing and were could not have been more pleased with our visit.Excellent as the other reviews have said.In planning my first trip to Charleston, and my first vacation in a long time, I became, well, obsessed, with finding a great place to stay. The French Quarter Inn didn't disappoint. The location was excellent, and the service was exceptional. My favorite part though was the afternoon wine and cheese. Although not normally my style (except for the wine and cheese part), it was nice to be able to come back after a long day of exploring, and be able to settle in next to the fire with a glass of wine and some of that yummy spreadable Boursin. The pillow menu was great too!I am typically one for modern hotels, but this is my favorite hotel, no question. The location is in the heart of downtown Charleston, and the customer service is top notch. Every morning there is a yummy breakfast available, all day there is an assortment of hot and cold beverages (including a refreshing yummy detox water). Every evening there is a wine and cheese party. My favorite part: there was coffee and tea right outside of my room every morning. It's those little touches that make this place my favorite. Also, the rooms are spacious, soft beds, lots of pillows and towels. I can't wait to come back!My wife and I stay here at least once a year. It is her favorite Charleston hotel. The service is gracious and friendly - a bit of the bubbly on arrival, cheese and wine in the late afternoon, etc. The rooms are quite large and attractive. Drawbacks are no pool or an excellent in-house restaurant. The latter is not a major problem though as their are many wonderful eateries in the city.The location is really the big selling point for this hotel.  If you want to spend a few days walking around downtown Charleston, just valet park your car and stay here.  You're right next to the market, close to tons of restaurants, and just a block or so from the water.  The hotel itself is lovely, although we didn't do too much wandering around.  We had breakfast in our room every day but they put a nice spread out in the lobby as well (eat the pastries, I'm still craving the coconut one every morning!).  Our room itself was huge!  Between the bedroom and the sitting room you could have run sprints.The pillow menu is really neat, we particularly liked what we referred to as the ""NASA pillow"" (I think the menu said it was designed by someone at NASA).  The thing weighed like 5 pounds and could make a deadly weapon in a pillow fight.  We kept missing the wine and cheese tasting in the evening because we were out enjoying the city, but we did get to have milk and cookies ;)  They also offered us a glass of champagne upon check in.This place is pricey but if you can swing it and spoil yourself for a few days it's a great place to stay.My parents hosted a welcome party here that was catered by Tristan. We had one of the meeting rooms upstairs that was pretty nondescript. We were more excited about the large patio/balcony that would have been the perfect party spot.Unfortunately the heat and humidity did not allow us to be outside, so we were all kind of crammed in to the meeting room. It wasn't anything bad or offensive, just nothing special. The main entrance to the hotel is very attractive, with a large spiral staircase in the main foyer. I really liked the iron work on it. +1 star for the M&amp;Ms and Jelly Belly's they've always got upstairs.Perfect location and wonderful service and accommodations.Stayed here again for 3 nights.  Consistently five stars.  Nice wine &amp; cheese touch in the lobby each evening.Do yourself a favor. Book here. It's close by great restaurants, shopping, and they even give you cookies at night. It was definitely one of the best hotel experiences of my life.What a pleasant surprise this Inn was beautiful.  We had a room equipped with a computer and complimentary Internet access.  Coffee and Tea was available right outside our rooms at all times.  The breakfast in the morning was terrific and had something for everyone.  The location was perfect, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to and take the trolley for those places just a little further out.Awesome!  Shopping  and historical sights are within walking distance. Supreme accommodations... Super staff.We stayed in Charleston, SC for a week last fall, and part of what made that week so wonderful was our stay at the French Quarter Inn. This is a lovely hotel with fantastic staff and service. We felt pampered and taken care of all week! And if you're particular about your pillows, they have a pillow menu. Yes, you can choose what kind of pillow you sleep on!  A continental breakfast is delivered to your room each morning. Also, there's a wine and cheese reception each afternoon.  Very decent.The FQI is located not far from the waterfront, so it's quite easy to walk around historic Charleston and pop back to the hotel to freshen up for dinner. There's an Italian place nearby called Cintra that has super martinis, as well as an Irish pub across the street. We loved it!My wife and I stayed here one night during our honeymoon, in the fall of 2008.  The staff was attentive and polite, the room was large and immaculate, and the view from our balcony was spectacular.  My wife especially enjoyed the pillow menu, while I liked the linens and the waffle-pattern bathrobe.  The manager gave us a bottle of champagne for our celebration, which was a nice kickoff to a night on the town.  I have no complaints about the French Quarter Inn, and look forward to staying there again.  There are about a dozen excellent dining options within walking distance.",,,"['spoiled', 'pampered', 'days', 'difficult', 'readjust', 'return', 'real', 'lives', 'tomorrow', 'quarter', 'inn',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/andrew-pinckney-inn-charleston,Andrew Pinckney Inn,4.0,$$$,49,"I stayed there for Halloween with my boyfriend and it was amazing.This hotel is very pretty outside and inside. Our room was very cosy and clean, plus quiet!We had booked the petite queen bedroom and at our arrival they had updated us. Was very kind! Service is perfect.They also have a great terrace with a nice view.Very convenient and well located. I definitely recommend this place! We loved our stay!The Andrew Pinckney was a very cute hotel and was in an awesome location, but we were deceived about the parking situation. We did not know when we booked that here was a $20 fee to park your car nightly. This should at least be rolled into the nightly hotel cost. That said, the staff was very nice to us while we were there and recommended some great places to eat in the area.I let her chose our accommodations, and when she said ""an inn"" I was thinking of the typical new England inn....white federalist building with Autumn leaves...well that's not what we drove up to...the building is a bright mustard yellow color right in the center off town. But she was right....comfortable bed in a relaxing room, with a decent view of the city. I loved sitting next to the amazing brick fireplace in a comfy chair with my books. (It was too warm for a fire but it must be awesome!) The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and PROUD of their city...the wealth of knowledge was impressive. They always had a smile ready too. We didn't utilize the concierge much, but they knew how to make things happen. Other hotels need to learn from these folk I loved, no...adored...the rooftop continental breakfast. I could have day out there all day as well...but we had a city to see. The rooms were perfectly appointed with the optional mix of old world charm and modern amenities. High count sheets... plush, absorbent towels, excellent bath amenities....I think I like being pampered.I absolutely loved this hotel. It was definitely one of my best experiences at a hotel.  It's in a great location and all of the staff were so nice.  Breakfast was amazing. I will definitely be staying there again in the future.Stay away unless you like tiny rooms that smell like smoke for $500/ night, rude uncaring front desk staff, broken shades, freezing cold breakfast since the only place to eat is an outdoor terrace for breakfast and photos that do not represent where you are staying at all.  I've stayed in all levels of hotels and Inns and this was horrible for the price!!!  What a huge mistake!!Clean room, polite and helpful staffs..and an awesome breakfast on the patio...just loved it!!My boyfriend and I were visiting Charleston for the first time for his Birthday. I choose Andrew Pinckney Inn based on the reviews and location. We weren't disappointed by our choice in the Inn. When we arrived Friday at 11pm we were greeted by the staff. The check in process was quick and we were helped with our bags. We choose to use the valet service while we were in town, because this was our first visit we didn't want the hassle of trying to find parking. When we needed the car we called down and the car was always pulled up front and ready for us when we wanted it. We were upgraded from a queen room to a king suite upon our arrival. The room was very nice. The bed was comfortable. My only complaint was the bathroom floor had what looked like a wine spill that was never cleaned up during our stay. The Inn's location was perfect. We walked everywhere except the days we went to the beach. There are a lot of options for bars and restaurants. Highly recommend the Gin Joint for drinks. Each Morning we ate the continental breakfast on the 4th floor. Its better then most I've had before. Biscuits and gravy, mini quiches, pastries, bagels, fresh fruit, cereal, oatmeal, juice, coffee, tea. There is a nice rooftop area to sit that was heated for the winter months that was a good spot to enjoy your breakfast and the view. The Inn also provided wine and cheese in the evenings for 4-5, we didn't get to experience this while we were in town. Overall this place was great. We would stay here again and would recommend it to friends and family.Loved the southern charm of this quaint hotel. From the paint colors to details like crown molding and exposed brick, this hotel is southern charm through and through. The staff wears adorable bow ties and are very friendly. I loved this hotel! The 4th floor terrace and breakfast was a nice bonus.I travel to Charleston a lot for work so it's important I get a good nights sleep but am also close to shopping and restaurants. This hotel is perfect for that. I am in walking distance to King St., East Bay St., across the street from the Market, and surrounded by restaurants. It's an older building with reclaimed wood floors and updated bathrooms. Staff was super friendly too.  Free breakfast was included on the 4th floor where you can sit outside and take in the beautiful view. They also had complementary wine and cheese from 4-5pm! My room was smaller, but I didn't care, I was by myself, and working all day so all that mattered to me was a clean room and comfortable bed! I will definitely stay here again. Love it!I stayed one night at the end of February and had a GREAT experience. My room was great -- very clean, comfortable, and with all the accouterments of a nice hotel (bathrobe, high-quality personal items, etc.). The front desk staff was excellent. He got me a last-minute reservation at the nearby Cru Cafe -- which I HIGHLY recommend (the fried green tomatoes are amazing). The hotel's location was perfect, located in the heart of the historic area of downtown, but on a side street with little traffic. No problems comfortably walking to all of the wonderful landmarks of beautiful Charleston.Luxurious, historic and charming. Right in the heart of downtown Charleston. This staff to great care of us, and upgraded us to a townhouse suite since it was our wedding night! Thoroughly impressed!Very beautiful bright room on the 4th floor of the newer building (across the way from the reception).  I feared the smell of horses, per other reviewers, but this was never an issue, even in the heat of august.  Cookies, biscotti, lemonade, iced water, and hot tea in the reception.  Free Wine hour on the rooftop terrace provides cheese /crackers, nuts, grapes, and red or white wine.  Breakfast on the rooftop terrace was ok... Cheese eggs, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, cereal, fruit, pastries/bagels.  Overall would definitely return.I wanted to stay somewhere I could easily walk to and from the historic downtown area and Andrew Pinckney Inn came up. Since I was booking pretty lay I didn't have a lot of choices and this place was a bit more than I was hoping to spend but I decided to give it a go.The folks in the check in lobby were very friendly. Check in time is around 3pm but sometimes they have the rooms available earlier from what I understand. When I came in the fellow at the front desk let me know that he didn't think they'd be able to get my room ready early but took my number to call me when the room was ready. The lobby had cookies, biscotti, coffee and tea and comfortable couches. I stayed in a room with a single queen or twin sized bed. You can tell the rooms have been here for some time. They have character that usually has to be emulated in many other hotels. The room had all the amenities one normally expects. I found the room to be comfortable though not without it's faults which likely are due to the age of the inn. For instance there are not many outlets in the room. The only available power outlet in my room was in the bathroom. I ended up unplugging the in room iPod clock and using that plug for charging my devices. The other possible age related issue was soundproofing. While I did not find the place loud at all sounds from outside leaks in easily.The continental breakfast is way better than what most places provide. As an example, the first day had scrambled eggs with good cheese and bacon, biscuits and gravy, muffins, croissants, cereals, yogurt, coffee, tea, milk, juice and coffee. And you can eat on the balcony, in an area in the middle of the inn with nice chairs or back in your room.The location is a huge plus. Most of the things I decided to check out were within 20 minute walks with many things being much closer. If nothing else this feature alone makes the place worth the price.Our stay at Andrew Pinckney Inn was better than anything I could have ever expected. We stayed in room 101 across the street from the main lobby. It was a large king room with high ceilings, old hardwood floors, a chandelier and plantation shutters. We also had the flower boxes outside the windows since our room faced the street, which was a pleasant touch. The bathroom was on the small side but the overall size of the room more than made up for it.Aaron at the front desk went out of his way to make sure that we were enjoying our stay in the hotel and the city in general. There was a mix up with some champagne we ordered and he was extremely responsive to the situation and we ended up with a second bottle of bubbles. The older gentleman with the black rimmed glasses in the lobby was also very nice and made some amazing restaurant recommendations. Finally, the young African-American valet was very attentive and we never had to wait more than a minute for our car to be pulled out. He also helped us load our luggage into our car when we left.On Sunday morning during our stay there was a problem with the wifi. I called the front desk to inform them of the issue. Later that evening we went to get some coffee from the lobby and the wifi was still not working. We asked the gentleman behind the desk if there was a known problem with the internet connection. He said that there had been some reports of it being out. We asked if anyone was working on the problem and if there was an estimate of when the service would be back up. He gave a very curt reply that he could call Comcast but that he wasn't working on it, to which I thought they should have called Comcast 8 hours ago. The wifi was back up a few hours later. We weren't there for the wifi but it does help save on our data plans. This was the only slightly unpleasant experience we had, but Aaron more than made up for this other gentleman's shortcomings.Overall, we would definitely stay at the Inn again and it is our top choice for lodging in Charleston.The Good....We had an issue with our room but the hotel staff took care of it and kindly accommodated us in the upmost respectful way possible. THIS is the only reason we will stay here again vs other establishments in the area. Rooms and the bathrooms are clean and amenities are great. The Bad and the Ugly...A/C unit is way too close to your bed in some rooms, so ask for an extra blanket in the hot summer months.It was our first time in Charleston and this is exactly what we were looking for.  The hotel was very old world Charleston, clean and comfortable.  The service was fantastic.  Next time we are in town we will be staying here again and its not just for the fresh baked cookies they put out in the lobby everyday at 2pm.My favorite part of staying at Andrew Pinckney was the fact that it definitely wasn't haunted. Quaint, historic feeling, but unarguably -not- haunted. When you're visiting a city as rich in history and thus, spiritual action, as Charleston, it's nice to know your bone-resting sanctuary is void of phantom life (or ""unlife"" as it were).With my semi-extensive travel through the Southeast I'm always on the lookout for spots that reflect the local culture and weave the vibrancy of the local lore but also feature the moden-day comforts like plush bedding, flat screen TV, and an iPod charging station. Pinckney Inn catered to all of these needs. The AC unit proved to be the only thing less than fantastic about the room. Featuring its own handheld remote, the temperature and settings were a little funky to operate and if you consider yourself un-tech savvy, you'll likely need to call in reinforcements to get that thing going.My king sized bed was fluffy and the sheets hit my weary bones with a puppy's softness. While I couldn't check in until close to 3, I converted the comfortable lobby into my own couch-laden workstation. Plus, there's never-ending free lemonade and you'll find free cookies waiting for you in the late afternoon.The hotel is conveniently situated in the heart of the historic district action and you'll find extensive dining and shopping options well within walking distance. Prefer a horse and carriage, you're lucky, the sable is just around the corner. I'll certainly return on my next visit to Chucktown.Absolutely lovely stay - and I'm in hotels quite a bit. Everyone we interacted with from the valet to the maid was very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was nicer than standard hotel fare. The St Phillip's suite is worth it if you can afford it and find a time it's available. I highly recommend this hotel and I don't say that lightly.Great Spot! Great location! Nice people, and we got upgraded to a suite!Felt like I was taking a risk going with a non-""name-brand"" hotel, but it was a bet that paid off for us!We loved the rooftop area for drinking wine and overlooking the city, the breakfast was nice-and included, and the location was perfect for walking everywhere. Staff was great and the cookies in the afternoon were absolutely delicious! I think we probably ate, like,  10 of them!Nice HotelCentrally locatedStaff is very attentive BUTWalls are thin-- noisy with every little door closing or movementBuffet was Ok.. view is great.... fruit tasted like canned  , biscuits were very dry, bagels tasted frozenRooms need more outlets available for todays electroniccsOh and I failed to mention I saw a roach climbing the wall in the bathroom--Yes.. I did kill it.If you like old and rustic  this is it.. I would have preferred old feel with modern conveniences","Amazing staff! We stayed in Charleston for 4 days and stayed in the Andrew Pinckney on Thursday and Sunday. We had family in town so staying in the family hotel on Friday and Saturday was a must. The reason I mention this is that I stayed in two rooms in the Andrew Pinckney, as well as another hotel, so I feel I can compare them well. Our first room was on the first floor and had a limited view, but the location, bed and staff more than made up for it. We enjoyed the breakfast on the 4th floor terrace and although there wasn't any bacon, we still had an enjoyable meal and it was a great way to start the day. As you can see from the other reviews the location is great. I found that for the location the price couldn't be beat a truly felt like I found great value in the hotel. The valet/door guys were extremely nice and helpful. The parking situation is limited in Charleston, but these guys do a great job of making you forget that (not that way in all of the other hotels). However, the thing that made me want to write this review is that a gentleman named Sandy, I believe he is the manager, notified me that I had left a suit in the room. I told him I was on my way to another hotel and would try and swing by the following day to pick it up, but he said that he was driving by and would drop off the suit to my hotel. I was blown away by that service. First, most hotels would even call, but to then drive it to my location? That's the kind of service that makes me want to do better at my job. The hotel is run by good people and it flows down through the staff.The only negative I found (and in an attempt to prove I'm being fair and balanced) is that I did have an issue with outlets on my second night. We got a third floor room with a great view, but the number of outlets was minimal. I'm sure if I asked the staff would have put one in (I kid, I kid). However, if you want to stay in a historic building that's the sacrifice you have to make. Plus, you're in Charleston ... get off your computer!Great stay, great people, good amenities, wonderful value. I'll stay here again for sure.We stayed there this past week and will be back. Staff was so friendly and loved our room. The people that work here care about you and try to make your stay as pleasant as possible. Had a good breakfast and wine and cheese in the evening. We will never stay anywhere else. We stayed in room 401, big room right near the terrace.I've stayed a few different places in Charleston. Hotels and campgrounds alike, but Andrew Pinckney Inn really set the bar this time around. It was the perfect spot for our short getaway and these guys hit all the right notes to glean a 5-star rating. We pulled in long before check-in, but they were still accommodating. Concierge was gracious enough to let us handle all of the details for our room around 11am (check-in is 3pm) and even let us park our car in valet for the time being. If you've ever been to Chuck Town, parking is really difficult for out-of-towners. Lots of residential parking only where parking passes are required. These guys gave us total peace of mind with our vehicle. Huge props for that. They also took our bags and placed them in our room without us having to worry about anything at all. Second, the kindhearted staff at the desk was so awesome. Helpful, funny, and gracious to have us stay with them. They upgraded us to an amazing room unannounced. They just smiled at me and said thank you for staying with us! Unreal. The room was just as unreal. So big with an upstairs bed room, 1.5 baths, and an awesome patio deck with great views of Bay St. I didn't quite like the bed, as it was HUGE and kind of stiff but, hey, I'm not complaining about the upgrade! I'm just a soft bed kinda dude. The complimentary continental breakfast was nice, too. Nothing amazing, but a nice snack to tide you over until lunch. These guys have my vote. If ever we're looking to stay in a hotel again, these guys are the place for us. Great location (just off of Market near the straw market) and a stones throw from some Charleston go-tos. Done and done.I spent 6 nights here and I got exactly what I wanted and the some.  I wanted to stay in a ""boutique"" historic inn while in Charleston, and the Andrew Pinckney is just that.  I stayed in the restored home section, built in 1840, and even has the original wood floors!  The room was small, but with all modern amenities.  It felt like I was staying in a home.  And all of the staff is fabulous!  I could not have asked for better service.  I would recommend this place to anyone and I would stay here again!Great location, walk to all resturants and shops. the hotel itself is ok, the room was cute but very tiny, you can't even fit tow people in the bathroom. The breakfast service was great since it's so expensive to eat around there. For a short stay, I don't mind to go back just because it is so convenient to get to every where. but if we are going for more than 3 days. I will find somewhere bigger.I stayed here recently,  the staff was incredible!  Andre at the front desk was incredibly helpful resolving a double booking issue with Hotels Tonight. The valet staff were fantastic,  very prompt and courteous.  My only complaint is with the A/C, the thermostats won't allow you to select a temperature lower than 72. The temperature in my room was actually 77, it become very stuffy and uncomfortable,  quickly.  The rooms were very nice, snug yes but given the age of the property understandable.  Overall I enloyed my stay, though I'm not sure if I would stay again, as the stuffy room did not allow for much rest. My room was registered under Dave Johnson, I stayed in room 101. ThanksSo happy we chose to stay here. Very cute, historic hotel right in the heart of Downtown Charleston. We arrived a few hours before check in time, and they accommodated us and had a room ready within 30 minutes. I loved that we were in walking distance to so many great restaurants and bars. Our room was small, but perfect for just the two of us. Very nice bathroom with updated fixtures, and the bed was amazing. Our room felt very homey and comfortable. Would recommend!We recently stayed in the corner room 114 by the valet parking service. We heard continual conversations and door slams at all hours of the day and night. Since we were street side I can attest that there is garbage pickup nightly in downtown Charleston and that around 5 am the street cleaner comes up and down the street 2-3 times. Needless to say this is probably one of the noisiest rooms I have ever stayed in.  There is a happy hour from 4-5. There is one bottle of red and one bottle of white wine. When they are gone, you are out of luck there is no more. So go early. We also witnessed an employee opening the wine bottle with her teeth. Right out in front for all to see. Makes ya wonder what happens to the food and beverage behind closed doors! On a positive note the room was clean, the sheets were amazing and the staff was helpful. We had a broken toilet the first night and it was immediately fixed the next day.I absolutely loved the staff when I stayed at Andrew Pinkney Inn. I booked last minute through Priceline and got a great deal, the people at the front desk were helpful in suggesting dinner spots and the valet guy was super nice and also made recommendations on where to eat, shop and visit during my stay. And he carried my bags up to my room.I stayed one night in the building across the street from the main part, where they also serve breakfast in the mornings. The only thing I'll mention, which I didn't think about until I was pulling up to the hotel, is that I'm pretty certain this place is haunted. And I am DEATHLY afraid of ghosts, but in the ""I have to know more and explore all things haunted"" kinda way. I would have thoroughly enjoyed being a tiny bit frightened had I not been ALONE, but I survived. I refused to google to see if it was haunted until after I left, which was a good idea since I did find several articles, including on their own site. The room / bed was super comfy, but due to the stress of ""Is it haunted, is it not??"" all night, I pretty much tossed and turned and had my eyes peeled much of the night. One thing I will say though is that my bathroom door absolutely DID move at one point that night and hit the wall, of that I am certain.All hauntings aside, I did enjoy my stay and would definitely stay again - preferably when someone stays with me. The hotel is nice, the staff is amazing, the breakfast is delicious and the walk is nice to the other areas of town.Beautifully decorated and designed rooms with paper-thin walls.  High class bathrooms with cheap motel toilet paper and tissues.  Cozy king bed faces tiny flat screen. Challenge your mind with two outlets in the entire room.  This hotel (like this city) will charge you more and deliver less, all with a smile.This place was PERFECT if you're looking to stay in downtown Charleston near the straw market and King Street.  We had a little townhouse with great master bedroom and balcony patio plus a downstairs sitting room. Walking distance from all the great restaurants and shopping and all the horse-drawn carriage tours are right there too.Plus the bedding was really comfortable, soft and clean and the staff was nice and helpful.  Nice continental breakfast upstairs on the patio deck with biscuits, bagels and most other things you'd expect.All in all for the price paid, this was a great place to stay. Pros:- Location. You can see the Market right down the road from here. Horse carriage tours are nearly next door. Centrally located within a mile of most everything downtown. Perfect location. - Valet service. Driving and parking in Charleston sucks to say the least. Being able to pull up and toss 'em the keys is perfect. AND, we stayed 3 days/2 nights, they only charge for the 2 nights. A+ in my book.- Ambiance. Historical Charleston, historical building. This is a lovely place.- Continental breakfast. OH MY GOODNESS. So good, and much more robust than your typical FREE continental breakfast at other places. Plus, you get to sit on the 4th floor terrace overlooking a good chunk of Charleston. Just fantastic.Cons:- Air conditioning. Oh, the AC worked great, mind you. But it's either an all-or-nothing type of system. And since there's no fan in the room, when the AC was off it got stuffy pretty quickly.- Fan in bathroom didn't work. There was one, just didn't work. Bathroom got really warm at night or after a shower. Also is nice to have for privacy when using the restroom, but no dice. - Very few outlets. Yes, yes, I know, on vacation so shouldn't be on these things anyway. But all we had were 2 phones and 1 laptop to charge. Fortunately they have an iPhone (older connection only) alarm/dock which we used, plus unplugged a lamp and used another outlet. Maybe just have a power strip somewhere useful?- Shower floor &amp; bathroom floor had no division. Like, the water could just flow out under the curtain into the rest of the bathroom. BUT, I don't know if I can fault this anymore as I recently learned that this is actually a handicap-accessible room. Don't know why we were in here, but it happened. - No window. Again, older historical building and such. But I would just like a window view of Charleston :)The pros definitely outweigh the cons though. Maybe if we had one of the traditional queen rooms next time some of the cons would disappear. But I would give this place more business in the future.Wonderful location!! Clean, nice size rooms, and pleasant staff. Kevin works at the valet station. He is very helpful, polite, and pleasant. Will stay here again on our next trip to Charleston.I stayed here for my first visit to Charleston based off of TripAdvisor reviews and I wouldn't hesitate staying here every visit. We had an inside room (no windows to outside) but I think I actually preferred this because the room was pitch dark at night which made for a perfect nights sleep.  The breakfast buffet was nice....im not really a breakfast food type of person to begin with but my husband is and he really enjoyed the food.  You can go out onto the balcony at night which was pretty awesome to just relax and look out onto the city.  The location was great...walking distance from everything we wanted but far enough that I didnt notice street noise.  The staff was very friendly and I felt right at home.  The only reason I didnt give it a 5 is because there was an odd smell during a couple of the days which could have been from the way the wind was blowing from the paper mills that are outside of the city so its not really the hotel's fault but depending on how often the smell comes to the area it could be a deterrent.Location was great, staff were as everyone else has said, wonderful.  The only complaint, and it's a major one, was the tiny room with no closet or functional sitting area. With bags In the room, it was VERY cramped with the ironing board right in the room.  We would not recommend this place when there are chain hotels with much better accommodations as centrally located. We we're expecting a beautiful, unique, boutique hotel and got a cheap hotel room.ZERO STARS!!! I flew all the way from Los Angeles, CA for a vacation with my mom in South Carolina. On the drive down to Charleston, our car engine caught on fire. As it was a Sunday, there were no repair shops open, and we were stranded. I called Andrew Pinckney Inn at 12:30 pm to let them know our car broke down, we had no way to make it to Charleston for our reservation that night and to find out if my mom could get a gift certificate for a future date for the night we'd already paid for. The employee told me in a discourteous tone that I'd have to call Expedia because we booked through them.I immediately called Expedia, and they told me they would call Andrew Pinckney Inn and request a refund. The Expedia representative told me that no one was answering the phone at the hotel. I told him I'd just been on the phone with them explaining we'd broken down. The Expedia representative put me on hold again and finally got someone at Andrew Pinckney Inn to answer the phone but said he had to leave a voicemail for the manager requesting the refund. Expedia told me to call back in 2 hours. At 2:30 pm I called Expedia and they let me know that Andrew Pinckney Inn had refused to refund us. I plan to dispute the charges with our bank and file a complaint with the BBB. It was bad enough to fly all the way across the country to have our car break down, deal with unplanned for repair expenses, have our vacation ruined and be stranded but to then be charged for a night at a hotel where we never stayed because our car broke down??? I am shocked at the unethical, greedy actions of this business and that they would be so despicable as to take advantage of patrons already in a bad situation at Christmas! The LEAST they could've done is offer a gift certificate for my mom to come back and stay some other time. As a Southern transplant from California, I am disgusted. This is absolutely NOT what southern hospitality is about and this hotel should be ashamed.First off, GREAT location.  Easy walking distance to just about everything downtown.  If you are looking for location, I would recommend.  I did not find the staff quite as helpful as everyone else.  We used the concierge a number of times and quickly came to realization that Yelp would give us better info. The breakfast choices were so-so, at best, and the roof top terrace a little cramped.  We like to enjoy a longer breakfast but felt like we should get up so other guests could sit down.  Ending on a positive note, the cookies in the afternoon are great - perfect after a day walking the old city.Comfortable hotel very convenient to Meeting, Market, East Bay and King Streets.  Published rate is approx. $200 but usually I am able to book it online for approx $150.  I have stayed here 3-4x and have no complaints. It is clean and, though might seem a bit no-frills to some due to bath towels that are a bit sandpaper-y and a lack of glamorous bath gels , comfortable and charming.  I have had rooms that run the gamut in size, from a tiny one to huge ones with hot-tubs in them.  The complimentary breakfast is a nice spread (mini-whole wheat bagels, nice assortment of teas, etc.) and the staff is always nice and helpful.  Plus, free internet and I think I have always gotten free parking behind the lobby or in the lot across the street.  Recommended.Had a great time in Charleston..the best thing was coming back to the Inn.   After walking around the city.  The inn is in a excellent location.  The rooms were very nice. Decent breakfast on a beautiful terrace overlooking the city.  We will be back!By name, this historic quaint inn.  Good price. Nice staff. Ok rooms.","We stayed in the handicapped room and it was very spacious.  The rooms are clean and nice and the location is awesome! Staff was helpful and breakfast was super. Having wine on the top deck area made it a great value for us!This inn is a perfect location to visit historic Charleston.  It's located on a quiet side street, in between the two main drags, and is in walking distance to pretty much the whole dowtown and the Battery.The staff was very courteous...we got to check in early, and they were helpful with a taxi the one time we needed one.  The lobby is so quaint and makes you feel like you're in someone's home rather than a typical hotel.  We had the pleasure of seeing it decorated for Christmas too.   And the spread of coffee, tea, cocoa (with GOOD fix-ins like marshmallows and heathbar), and cookies was pretty sweet.The breakfast was nice, though the time we were there it was way too cold to sit outside and enjoy the terrace.  But I'm sure on a nice day it would be quite charming.   Luckily they have an atrium area on the second floor with more seating to eat inside.Our guest rooms were nice, very basic, but had what we needed.  And I believe they actually use fabric softener on the towels!  This is the first hotel I've ever been to where the towels didn't feel like sandpaper.  So major props for that.   The only thing I would say to be mindful of is that if you're easily annoyed by noise, this might not be the place for you.  It's an old building, so the soundproofing isn't up to par.  We had 1st floor rooms and could hear some street traffic in the morning when a few big trucks parked nearby, and you can definitely hear anyone in the hallways (maids, other guests, etc) like they were practically in your room.  But you get used to it.  Rates were VERY reasonable for this type of accomodation.  While I'm sure they are pricey in whatever their peak season is, it was right on the same price level as a cheap hotel when we went.  And you would never get the feeling you were in a cheap hotel here.I really felt like this place was a little hidden gem that we were lucky to find.What a fun place to stay.  Clean, historic, nice.  Beware; some rooms don't have windows.The other two reviews described this place perfectly. While our room was a little snug, the comfortable bed, updated interior and experience of staying in a building from 1840 made up for the lack of space. The staff was incredible. I stay in 30+ hotels a year and this hotel's crew really left a positive impression on me. The location was also ideal - park your car at check-in and forget about it until check-out. You're right in the middle of the best of Charleston.The breakfast was also much better than I anticipated. Usually continental breakfasts are lousy, but this was quite good and had much more substantial dishes than just bagels and muffins. The 4th floor terrace was a nice place to eat in the morning before you start your day.My Fiance and I absolutely loved everything about Andrew Pinckney Inn. To start, you can't beat the location if you want to be in downtown Historic Charleston. It's a block from the Market and a ton of wonderful restaurants. As well as, all the carriage rides start on the street over from here. The continental breakfast on the upper deck of the hotel was wonderful. I loved waking up, going up there and sitting on the deck enjoying the food and sun. I love the lobby of the hotel, I would love for my family room to have that historic but modern look someday. My Fiance was really excited about the drinks (water, coffee, hot tea, lemonade) and the cookies they had in the lobby all day long. We opted for one of the smaller rooms since we were only in town for a long weekend and were only in the room to sleep. It was small but quaint and comfortable. I can't say enough about how friendly and helpful ALL of the staff was, from being greeted in the lobby to the maids and the lady upstairs for breakfast. Whenever they saw you they saw us they would wish a wonderful day. I can't wait to go back next year! We normally stay at different hotels (to get different experiences) but Andrew Pinckney Inn is definitely a place I'll go back to.Great location extremely nice staff and comfortable beds! There are 2 parts to hotel. Our room was very quiet and comfortable. Would stay again!The Andrew Pinckney Inn was ground central for my sister's wedding weekend. Every room but one (those poor souls!) was a member of my family or another guest of the wedding, and the folks at Andrew Pinckney took great care of all of us. The inn is relatively small and is comprised of two parts. There are a couple of rooms and ""townhomes"" on the side of the street where the lobby is located, while the main inn is actually across the street. In the main building there's a rooftop patio and and the hallways all open up to a small atrium/seating area. The rooms are small but well appointed and comfortable. This place is charming and may not have all of the creature comforts that certain people like, but it's well priced and historic: very Charleston. The staff at the Andrew Pinckney was fantastic. They let us check in early (and out late) and helped us with all of our stuff, even though there's not a true bellman here. They even removed the beds from one of the rooms so we could create a ""hospitality suite"" for all of the guests to gather/consume massive quantities of alcohol. They provided a continental breakfast each morning off of the patio and had cookies, lemonade, and coffee available in the lobby.The location of the Inn is fantastic: just one block from the market and a short walk to the Battery. Be warned that there is a small stable in the bottom of the main building so if you're afraid of large horses or super sensitive to their smell, you may want to avoid being in that building (although if you hate the smell of horses, Charleston may not be the best place for you to begin with). I'd definitely recommend the Andrew Pinckney Inn if you're looking for the true Charleston experience.We loved our stay here! We were visiting from CA with our one year old, when we arrived to check in we discovered they had upgraded us to a suite with a roof top deck! Talk about a nice surprise! It was wonderful to have more room for everyone to move around! We would definitely stay here again! And the cookies were great!Before we arrived, we received a confirmation email outlining our stay: average price per night and number of nights. Upon arrival we signed the ""check in"" paperwork and the price was what we had expected. The day of check out we received a bill under our door for what we expected the amount to be. We went to the lobby to check out signing a bill that was what we expected. We get home, I check our checking account and it is for $250 more dollars than the bill I signed. I called and they said ""there had been a mistake."" While I understand mistakes happen, none of the paperwork we had nor signed said that amount. I just don't think business should be practiced like this. It was their mistake, not ours. I called several times and they didn't offer us anything other than ""it was a mistake.""  Our stay was nice, it is clean,convenient , historic and the wait staff is very friendly. As we visit the city often, I am sad to say we won't be back to the Andrew Pinckney Inn.",,,"['boyfriend', 'amazing', 'hotel', 'pretty', 'outside', 'inside', 'room', 'clean', 'plus', 'quiet',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-charleston-historic-district-charleston,Courtyard Charleston Historic District,4.0,$$,51,"During your stay, go speak to Kevin, the Concierge. He has tons of maps and lists of spots you have to visit, that you most likely never would have. I mean really this guys LOVES his job. He totally hooked us up and we saw tons of amazing sites on our trip that we no doubt would have missed. Also, the location is great as you're only a block from King St.16 years ago, a flat tire prevented this honeymooning couple from spending the day in Charleston.  Being a Midwestern girl who grew up enamored with Gone With the Wind and the romance of the south, I was so excited to see a plantation and step back in time to an bygone era. Alas, it wasn't meant to be. We spent the day in a tire shop in Columbia instead. Not quite as fun. Finally, 16 years later we finally made it back, this time en route to Hilton Head. We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Historic District for one night, with no definite plans. We decided to ask the concierge if he had any restaurant suggestions for dinner. Kevin McQuade, concierge extraordinaire, gave me the plantation experience I sadly missed so many years ago. He asked us our preferences, gave us some choices, hopped on the phone...and voila! We had a dinner reservation at Middleton Plantation. We toured the grounds before dinner, and I literally fell a little bit more in love with ""the south.""  Hot, humid, ancient, lovely, peaceful, lush, haunting, and bittersweet. I felt the pull and tug of melancholy as I saw pieces of the past slipping farther into history. I felt the gladness of experiencing a salvaged gift, taking what Middleton has to offer us today. Thank you, Kevin McQuade, for giving us a missing part of our honeymoon.Kevin the concierge is amazing. There is nothing by way of restaurant availability  this entire weekend but with Kevin we got reservations at two of the most exclusive restaurants in town.   Very engaging, professional and a pleasure to deal with. He also booked us into a walking tour and directed us to the best picture opportunities and historic sites in town.  Thank you Kevin you made our weekend.Out on the town for fun &amp; alcohol. Decided to spend the night. Chose this hotel for the proximity to everything. I loved it. It's big corporate busy &amp; very well run. Decor was seasonal &amp; very well done. The staff were great even though they are busy here. The rooms were clean &amp; spacious overlooking the park. Loved it here. It met all my needs &amp; perfect proximity to all the pubs &amp; restaurants on Upper King. Then this morning we headed to Lower King to shop. I'll definitely use this Marriott again. Even though I live in Mount Pleasant, I felt that I was on a mini vacation. The parking was $18 &amp; I got two passes but just used one. Thinking they would not refund me the unused one... They did. Great service. Highly recommend this hotel.This place is great. Friendly staff; very accomplished and hospitable. The Bistro restaurant in the lobby area was different from the other hotels we visit: open and welcoming. First looked like a fast food joint but, very comfortable and inviting. It is true the food and service were indeed fast but, of exceptional quality and, the alcoholic beverage far exceeds any chain restaurants servings which, I know, does not really grant justice, so, let me say: the drinks are great too. Would have given five stars but for the traffic noise which can be very loud sitting out on the balcony. Of course this is to be expected being right in the middle of the down town historic section of Charleston (the traffic noise mostly came from the busses. It would be a great improvement if the city converted them to electric), offering a great location to walk the whole historic area: which we loved. The view was great; good for people watching. Would definitely stay at this Marriott again.Very nice rooms, great staff. The conceriege was highly advertised so we headed down, but he was too much of a salesman. I feel that he definitely receives kickbacks on things and instead of just giving information he kept booking tours and making reservations at restaurants that I really didn't want. After speaking with my boyfriend we went back to our original itinerary and were very glad we did. However,  his maps are very helpful though. I do recommend that you visit him, just take time to investigate his suggestions and do what you wantGreat location, very friendly staff.  Best concierge I have come across in some time, Kevin McQuade.  We had a nine people in our group including 5 kids with ages ranging from 8 to 15.  He helped us organize two days in Charleston to really make the most of our time.  He helped us decide which tours where the best, recommended restaurants, made reservations for us and even got us a private ghost tour with a great tour guide named Ed Macy. More on Ed in another review.  Even if a Courtyard is not your first choice as a hotel the staff and Kevin made all the difference.Huge fan of Kevin the Concierge! He knew all the secrets, all the great restaurants, and directed us to an amazing walking tour. Our room was lovely. I was able to use points (otherwise out of my price range) to cover most of our stay. We did have a moment with some folks making the odd choice to spread out their food and eat in the hallway between our room and the elevator. ?! So odd, but the staff took care of it. Everyone from the great cleaning staff to the super helpful front desk to Kevin the Concierge - great experience.Very nice hotel, Kevin the concierge is delightful and totally animated and funny, and gave us great places to visit and eat.The staff is friendly and helpful.My one complaint? No makeup mirrors in the rooms! Hello? Do women not stay in the hotel? The front desk was unconcerned with my request, but I won't stay there again simply because of that need. Fix that and I will happily stay there again!We spoke to Kevin the concierge at the courtyard Marriott. It makes it worth it to stay here just so that you can get his secret maps and tips!! He is a fountain of useful information.  One recommendation he gave us as we didn't have a lot of time was to rent bicycles. We did and it was a wonderful feast for our eyes. We really had a great time. Thanks again Kevin you are the best!! The location if the hotel is quite ideal near shops and restaurants   Lots of wonderful sights and good food to eat.We had a night in the city before heading out to Isle of Palms, so we gave the Courtyard a shot. During our last visit to Charleston, we stayed in a much more upscale hotel and were highly disappointed with the tiny rooms and old amenities. The Courtyard was great.  Very new and updated.  Large rooms and a very big bathroom.  Location is really good (short walk to everything).  Parking is really easy ($18/day). Free Wifi.  I will definitely stay here again.After spending 2 nights out in the Charleston suburbs - closer to the Plantations - we decided to spend 1 night in Charleston's historic district at the Courtyard by Marriott.  This hotel is ideally located and is an easy walk to the Main Visitor's Center and to many of the sites within the historic district.  The hotel was extremely clean and comfortable and was very quiet.  Parking is an extra $15 per night in a garage/parking deck adjacent to the hotel with full in and out privileges.  The rooms were spacious and the beds were very comfortable.  In addition to charging for parking, hotels in the historic district also do not provide the free breakfasts that are common in so many other hotels.  However, there is an on-site coffee shop (cafe) that had a nice variety of reasonably priced breakfast items.Due to its proximity to the historic area and the comfort of our room, I'd return here for another visit and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to be near the historic district.Nice hotel in a great location.  Lots of cool things to see that are all walking distance.  Very good service.  I did think the price was a little high and don't know if I would stay here again because of that.Love this hotel! Super clean, extremely friendly &amp; professional staff, great location, pool &amp; a Starbucks/bistro/bar in the lobby...EXCELLENT!! Also, bed was very comfy and A/C worked very well in room.Got here at 4pm. Room not ready until 5:30. Reservations were made a month in advance. No apologies at front desk. Oh, and it's $18/day for parking in the Church parking lot across the street. Not even a garage and its $18?!?!  As I waited in lobby for 1.5 hours for my room to be ready after traveling all day I noticed everybody in Charleston stops in to use lobby bathroom and change in and out of bathing suits. Needless to say, the Lobby bathroom was a disaster.  Not impressed thus far.This Courtyard is nicer than the Embassy in the area.   It's more modern, the facilities are nicer and newer and it seems more  upscale.   Those are the good things.  No ghosts either!Food and drink are not as good and is definitely more limited.   I didn't use the 24 hour snack bar, but that's a sign that they realize that there isn't as much to offer.   Parking can be pretty challenging, as well.  I thought the staff was pretty friendly, but wasn't able to use the concierge when I needed assistance.This Courtyard is located in the Charleston's Historic district... an easy walk to the Market district. It's also a few blocks from the docks/waterfront and there are tons of restaurants in the area. (Another Broken Egg, Coast, Charleston Grill, Noisy Oyster... just to name a few) The hotel and the rooms are very clean...  although on our way down to FLA, we were given a room in which someone had smoked a cigar. When I complained, they said it was a no smoking hotel... no smoking anywhere, but someone had obviously ignored this directive. We were offered another room but it was late and frankly the cigar must have been a good one because it wasn't a bad/funky smell. I kinda liked it although my wife would disagree. They did send up and ionizer which did help remove some of the smell. The king size bed was very comfortable... the wife and I appreciated that. Overall... a very nice hotel. THe hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Wifi was good... not great. as it dropped me and I had to log back on several times. The only real complaint I have is the $18 fee for parking. This seems to be a trend now. I've been a member of Marriott for years and have found this fee annoying every time I come across it. I suppose they could charge more for the room to cover this ""expense""... I mean I know I have to park somewhere... but why charge. The lot must be paid for a hundred times over! Take this charge off and I'm giving this hotel 4.5 stars!For a Courtyard Marriott, this was pretty good. However, for the exorbitant prices that were charged... not so much. I'm not sure if it is because of the location or the fact that there were a few weddings in town, but prices were high. They were more in line with 4 and 5 star hotels that I have stayed in the past. Therefore, this review is based on those comparisons.Positives: Comfy bed, clean room, air conditioning, pool (albeit tiny), fast and efficient counter service, concierge, location, security entry in evening hours, wifi, bar and nice lobby bathrooms, fast housekeeping when requested extra towels, fitness room, computer to print flight tickets, held bags on checkout day until leaving for airport.Negatives: Parking was cramped and we needed to park in fake spots despite having paid extra for parking, no shuttle service to airport, poor toiletries, stuck toilet paper dispenser, poorly responsive tv remote controller, no heat lamp or fan to defog bathroom, no complimentary breakfast or sit down restaurant (snack bar instead), no tourist pamplets (concierge was often busy), extremely slow elevators, poor noise insulation from hallway to room.Many of the negatives I can deal with. We used public transportation on buses when needed and the city visitor center is about 3 blocks away. I recommend breakfast at the farmers market in the next door Marion Sq on Saturdays and Kudu coffee house a block over. Brunch/lunch downtown is a pretty good value. Obviously, you are paying for location here. Nevertheless, I cannot rate this hotel highly unless its price drops below 200 per night consistently.Stayed here for a work trip. Perfect location for downtown. A block away from kings st and there is even a park across the street that's nice. You can walk to any bar or restaurant within minutes.Keep in mind you are going to pay $18 a night for parking and the parking garages nearby are $16 so it's better just to park at the hotel where your car is closer.The concierge girls are very friendly and helpful, they helped my buddy rent a car that he picked up 20 min after booking for a place down the st.The mini fridge in my room was tiny and there was no microwave. You can go down to the lobby to use one there if you want though. Very clean rooms and good control of a/c unit.Stayed here for two nights in May while I was visiting Charleston. Everyone was super nice from the front desk agent to the maid to the server on her break and especially Kevin and the assistant concierge. While staying here one must spend some time with the concierge and get a walking map of Charleston and best places to take photos etc.. He was very helpful in suggesting a hidden gem for dinner one night. The three stars- The room needed some extra TLC like the vent in the bathroom was dirty and the soap holders needed some extra scrubbing. Also a few of the walls in the room needed extra cleaning as there were marks on the wall.","I just wanted to send the good people that work at this hotel some love.  They have been through so much these past through weeks with the tragic shooting and the chaos that has ensued.  We unknowingly arrived not realizing the location of the hotel and stayed through the President's visit across the street.  The staff were so on the ball, helpful, and sweet I couldn't say enough good things about them.  The hotel property itself was in great shape, our room as modern, spacious, and spotless as was the lobby.  The pool and gym were great and the location is excellent.If 3.5 was an option that would be my rating. I'm being generous about 4 stars because I'm so loyal to Marriott.. The location is great (5 stars) but the beds are hard and not that comfy... And there isn't much in the way of sundries / meals etc... Need to eat elsewhere for sure. And pool /surrounding pool area is too small. Other than that I recommendI had some meetings here the other day. A friend had reserved a conference room but something got mixed up with the booking. No big deal. We were only meeting with one other person at a time. We went into the business lounge and grabbed a table. I needed to print a couple things which was no problem at the available computers with quick laser printing.Most of the tables are round booths with power outlets and small lcd tvs as well. The booths were comfortable and the decor was inviting. The staff was very accommodating and personable as well. In passing I met the chef Justin (Formerly of Fulton 5). Sounds like he has some creative culinary concoctions going on in the kitchen. I need to get back and try their food soon.We chedcked in mid afternoon and we were directed to see Kevin McQuade (concierge) by the front desk to answer some question we had.  This guy is great.  He had us eating lunch at Cru (sit at the chef's table), dinner at Cypress  and the other dinner at Trattoria Lucca.  Sent us on a walking tour with a 13th generation Charlestonian, what a great tour.  Kevin makes this hotel what it is....It is also in a great location.This was my second stay  in this hotel in the span of 12 months.  Both times were ok. Rooms were clean and obviously recently renovated.  The second queen bed in our room was extremely rickety and noisy.  Staff is very cordial and helpful - except for the valet.  He's the only staff that I've encountered there that was rude and was reluctant to assist. The parking is cramped and definitely not sufficient for this hotel.   At $14 a day, we should at least be guaranteed a spot - not across the street in the church parking lot.  The internet was very, very slow and sketch at best.  The elevators are wayyy too slow.  Only saving grace is location and desk staff.  Embassy Suites across the park is preferred.I ordinarily would not have stayed at a Courtyard in Charleston, but I was intrigued by the many reviews lauding Kevin McQuade, the property's concierge.  So I made a reservation for my teenaged kids and me for two nights in April 2012 and our Kevin experience began.  I called him two weeks prior to our stay to discuss restaurants, possible itineraries, etc.  He asked if he could call me back in the evening when he had more time to discuss in depth what we wanted to do.  He spent a lot of time with me on the phone one evening shortly thereafter after which I had a list of restaurants, two tour reservations and Kevin's offer to take us on a nighttime walking tour of historic Charleston.Kevin spoke with us when we checked in, went over all of our plans and provided spectacularly detailed maps of Charleston, all of which were eminently useful and unexpected. The two tours he set us up with were both wonderful.  I don't want to ruin any surprises for anyone, so I will leave the details to Kevin himself.  My kids and I LOVED his nighttime walking tour.  He is a fount of knowledge about Charleston, and his enthusiasm for it is contagious.  Suffice it to say that this guy is hands-down the best concierge I've ever dealt with anywhere.  Plus, he is a very nice guy to boot.  The hotel itself is a nicely renovated building that has very attractive public spaces.  The room was clean and modern.  Parking at $14 per night was a bit steep, considering how tight the spaces were. Wifi was pretty strong and fast.Location was a decent walk from everywhere we wanted to be in the city.  Two good Starbucks are located on Calhoun a couple of blocks to the left of the hotel.  We enjoyed our stay, and I would go back in a heartbeat so I can deal with Kevin again!They have a decent breakfast cafe if you need something quick or convenient.OMG!! Kevin McQuade the Concierge!!  He is the best.  This is the only reason to go to this hotel, but it is worth it.Thanks to Kevin our trip to Charleston was a major success.  We arrived Saturday night, and there was a line of people waiting for Kevin, who was busy with a hotel patron.  He said he did not have time to work with me on Saturday, but for me to come first thing Sunday before the line got too long.8:00 am with a cup of coffee in hand, I sat down at Kevin's desk.  He arrived shortly after and worked with me to set up all I needed in Charleston.  He got us on something called the eco boat tour, which we loved.  He also set us up for Ann Middleton Herron's walking tour of Charleston, which I would not want to have missed.Kevin made our trip a success!SusanThe hotel is fine, but the concierge is fantastic!  Make sure you stop by and see Kevin McQuade, quite possibly the best concierge ever.. he has his own maps, tips and brings service to a whole new level.Fiance and I were here for a wedding.  The rooms were standard.  Nice but not great.  The biggest reason I decided to write a review is because you have to visit the concierge, Kevin, if you come.  You might have to wait up to 7 or 8 minutes to see him, but it is worth it.  Fiance and I only had a few hours, and he told us exactly where to go to see Charleston's charm (it ended up being beautiful) and made dinner reservations for us at a great new restaurant.  If you stay here YOU HAVE TO SEE KEVIN!Stayed here for 3 days (tonight being last night). Housekeeping hasn't done that great of a job, random hairs in bathroom and under soap holder in bathtub is very disgusting. The beds are comfortable but have woke up EVERYDAY with huge bug bites. The room isn't too impressive but still cute. Personally I would not recommend since breakfast isn't free, beds , &amp; careless housekeeping.Horrific customer service when attempting to make reservations for a future stay. Told different information by different personnel, hung up on by an individual, told there was no general manager and given erroneous information.  I spoke with personnel from the reservation line as well as the front desk individuals at this location.  I have stayed at this location numerous times for convenience but never again.  There are more options.We stay at a LOT of Marriotts because of business. This one ROCKED when we decided to spend some time in Charleston. Everything was perfect. Easy walk to downtown and the rooms were clean. The staff was fantastic. We'll come here again.Typical courtyard.  Solid property, good location and staff but Kevin the concierge outs them way over the top.  The best I have ever seen and I have seen many.  He will set up the best personalize itineraries down to the best photo ops in the city.  Truly unique and well done!Nicely remodeled, but very poor service.First, let me say I'm not surprised another guest reports he didn't get his room cleaned.  We had to ask several times.  It finally happened at, I think, about 5:30 PM.We also came with a six-month-old.  And despite reconfirming all details before arriving, the front desk told us we never asked for a portable crib with our room.  I had to show them the confirmation e-mail indicating it was there.Also, we arrived at about 3:00 PM.  And while rooms are not guaranteed before 4:00 PM, the front desk was utterly indifferent to the fact that we'd arrived with a young baby.  I understand if there's no room to be had a bit early, but could you please make some sort of suggestion on where we might go to make her comfortable until the room is ready?  Not here.  I felt like they just wanted me to step aside and leave them alone.Given we had to ask several times to get our room cleaned, I have a feeling I know why there were no rooms ready at a 3PM arrival.The rooms are nice, but this place is certainly lacking the city's famed southern hospitality.My husband and I stayed here the weekend right after Thanksgiving, 2012. It was a very nice hotel with clean rooms and friendly staff. I would definitely stay here again if I go back to Charleston. The are just a couple of reasons why I gave this a 4 and not a 5. Reason one is that the rooms and bathrooms were not as well lit as I would have liked, especially when trying to apply makeup! It would be wise of this hotel to at least beef up the bathroom lighting. I'm afraid I ended up being a little too heavy handed with the makeup because I couldn't see! The other reason was the parking. It is very limited, very tight, and costs a ridiculous $16 a day for SELF parking. Our Camry had a hard time fitting in the top lot, as the bottom lot was always full.My friends and I had a great experience at this hotel and was exactly what we wanted --- a solid hotel with good amenities at a good price, and within walking distance of restaurants and bars. The hotel features an outdoor pool, a fitness room, free wifi (which works so-so in the rooms), and a spacious and inviting lobby with TVs, a food/drink bar. One of the best features was the concierge.This place really encourages guests to visit the concierge for ideas about how to explore Charleston. We took advantage and got great tips, including a self-guided photo ""scavenger hunt"" and recommendations for where to go out at night.I definitely want to return to Charleston and will look to stay here again.Meh. It's a hotel. It gives you a place to sleep and clean up while you're visitng.We're visiting on business and it does the job. The cleanings aren't particularly exceptional.The food in the cafe is served during very limited hours and is very overpriced. The hot breakfast took 30 minutes to be delivered to our table, not ideal when you're off to work.The bar is only open until 10. They do offer a small snack bar where you can pick up snacks, frozen dinners and beer and wine 24 hours a day. This is great for the late nights after work and for running in and out.The fitness center is decent. Bigger than some of the other hotels in Charleston, that's for sure. I love that they have the TVs on the machines...it makes the workout go better. The cardio machines also look out over the pool, which is nice.The pillows are pretty small and square, but so comfortable!The towels smell weird and are very thin.I use an entire bottle of shampoo and conditioner in every shower and there still isn't enough conditioner. I'm also staying alone. Thank goodness I don't have to share.It is newly remodeled, which is why we chose it this trip. However, it's located further from downtown and the good restaurants and shops than we would have wanted.No valet parking, but plenty of spaces.Front desk is nice, polite and attentive when needed.Overall, it gets the job done. I just won't be swooning over it or coming back for the experience alone.Great hotel in line with other Courtyards around the country. Clean, hospitable, and great customer service. My wife and I were celebrating our honeymoon and the front desk was more than accommodating. They attempted to provide us with an upgraded room for the occasion, but because they were packed, they offered us comped parking for the week instead. We'll take it! Service: 5Cleanliness: 5Design: 4, typical courtyard design, but we've stayed at nicer courtyards in the past. Location: 4, it's fairly convenient to get around town. It's a short walk away from most attractions. Definitely ask to be put into one of the newer remodeled rooms.Couldn't agree more with Ernesto S. And his experience at this hotel. Same exact scenario, except traveling with a 4 yr old, and from a long distance away which is hard to judge travel time. Arrived at 1pm to desk staff giving (canned but same) response Ernesto got, only it was pouring rain and no where to go except sit in the lobby for three hours trying to entertain my child for three hours. Told room not ready till 4. Waited till 4 and guess what? Room still not ready. Had to get bell cart from desk, fill with my belongings and sit directly across from desk staring and waiting till I walked up at 445pm and asked if we were even going to make dinner reservations, their concierge made for us at 5:30. Also called down to desk twice asking for room to be serviced, and left hotel for four hours. Came back at 7:30 and not serviced. Called desk and they said they never got the message and weneed to leave again for a while if we want service. We just went with them dropping fresh towels and soap. Housekeeper was very apologetic, although not her fault. Walked within two feet of desk FOUR times, but two employees never broke their personal conversation to greet us or ask if we needed assistance. Went across street to buy items that were in their market next to desk, just because they couldn't be bothered. Hotel on the plus side was clean, bedding was great, and location was good. Concierge - Kevin was outstanding, and probably the best I have encountered at any property. They should hang on to him for his level of service alone.  Not sure what's going on with housekeeping and front desk but an overall blah performance.","Great location and amenities. I will stay here again when my journey takes me to the Courtyard.Nice hotel in decent spot. My only gripe, and it's a big one, is that we went a whole day without having room service replenishing our towels, shampoo, etc. By the next day our room looked like a bomb went off. Had to go to the lobby and ask for fresh toiletries. On ther plus side, they do have starbucks coffee offered in the lobby, and the concierge was a walking fact machine who spoke so fast (and I know fast talkers- I'm a native New yorker) that I felt like I needed a decoder ring to figure out what he said. Also, our tv remote was so slow to respond to the touch, I'm convinced it was powered by an off-site hamster in a wheel.Great stay due to the concierge service from Andrea at the desk.  She lined us up with Tommy Dew for a walking tour of historic Charleston that was a delight despite overcast skies. His charming and informative stories and southern history tales brought 1700-1800's Charleston alive.  She also recommended some fine restaurants and kindly booked them for us. And, handed us direction cards for each suggestion, including a visit to the famous 1200 year old Angel Oak tree on James island.  Prior to leaving she also provided self guided walking tour maps for Savannah and Beaufort which were helpful given we were headed to Hilton Head. Plus, she suggested a stop at Shelton cathedral ruins en route too.  The room we had was specious, clean, we'll appointed, and quiet.  Only complaint was upon our arrival the checkin clerk was sick and coughing and not very pleasant. However, Andrea the conserve more than made up for that. One other aside is that it is unfortunate that this Courtyard Marriott doesn't offer a complimentary breakfast even for elite level club members.I was completely impressed with the customer service of the Marriott Courtyard staff, and especially Kevin in concierge.  He was so helpful in assisting us map out our few days in town, even making reservations at restaurants on a very busy weekend!  It's so enjoyable to see someone enthusiastic about their job, and to do it so well.  He definitely made our trip more enjoyable, and productive.Not the newest Courtyard ever but nice and clean. Lobby and common areas have new Courtyard upgrades. Excellent location for King Street and the market area. Front desk staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Good parking rates for big city and all the Courtyard amenities which the kids love. I would recommend especially for a nice family trip.I have only positive things to say about this place. The staff is SO friendly and accommodating! The hotel itself is newly renovated, clean and in a great location. I look forward to staying here again the next time I'm in Chucktown.A perfectly nice little three star hotel in the historic district of downtown charleston. I was able to get a great rate on priceline, the hotel included free internet, and the parking wasn't too exorbitant. The rooms were clean and large, the staff were friendly, and it was all around a good experience.  I'd happily stay here again.Awesome hotel! Friendly staff and so clean!!!! Will stay at that hotel every time I stay in Charleston!  Free wifi!!!I've stayed in several hotels in charleston. This was my favorite. We had a suite and it was spacious and the dining table was huge. Perfect for eating in our room with our small child. Everything was clean and the bed was comfortable. This was a very nice hotel for a great price.  Location is good as well, but be warned the parking is self parking, not valet and costs $16 a day. We couldn't get a spot in the garage so we had to park at the church across the street. But our room faced the lot so we could keep an eye on our car and the lot was fairly well lit. Highly recommend this place.We were surprised and very pleased that the many reviews lauding Kevin McQuade, the property's concierge are indeed accurate. Lovely newly restored hotel in a great location, and we too landed a great last-minute priceline deal. Nice warm pool and exceptionally friendly staff.Better to stay at the nearby (and beautiful) Embassy Suites or even the attractive Hampton Inn both of which are a short walk away. Both offer free breakfast and classic surroundings.",,,"['speak', 'concierge', 'tons', 'maps', 'lists', 'spots', 'visit', 'likely', 'never', 'mean', 'really', 'guys', 'loves', 'job', 'totally',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-historic-district-charleston,Hampton Inn-Historic District,4.0,$$,51,"This Hampton inn location is located in the historic district of downtown charleston, conveniently located near major shopping centers of king street as well as some of the finest restaurants in the area.As all Hampton Inn's, this one serves their free breakfast between the hours of 6 and 10, they offer indoor seatings as well as outdoor ones when and if it's not too humid or rainy.Rooms are always clean but they need a major remodeling as some of the furniture in the rooms are a bit old school.My favorite part is their nice size outdoors swimming pool, a good place to unwind after a long day of work.We enjoyed our weekend stay.  The kids loved going down for breakfast in the morning.  Room was clean and comfortable, if small.  The hotel readily provided us with a pack n play, babysitter referral and pizza menus when asked.  The vending machine on our floor took credit cards. I did not notice any mildew or cigarette smells as others have noted.  I would definitely stay here again.I really enjoyed staying here and I felt more and more at home each day. Breakfast is rather shit but has good variety. Rooms are also kinda small. But they have free coffee 24/7 and the staff is always friendly and helpful. Gym is nicer than average (with a cable rack). My boss will definitely thank this hotel for having a good business center with actual functional computers where I did some urgent emergency work. What makes this hotel really ideal is its location. it's next to the visitor center bus hub where a lot of tours and bus lines start. It's also really walkable to the maritime center where you hop on boats, and the posh French Quarter, the old market, and the residential West Side with bunch of authentic local restaurants.Great location - and you'll pay for it. At $300 a night with a discounted wedding party rate, you will be scratching your head about what you get for those bucks besides location. Mold in the shower, sheets with holes, cobwebs and otherwise lazy housekeeping services that haven't had an eye for quality over the years will leaving you wondering how Hilton hangs it's name out front. There was one person at the front desk with a line of 7-8 people deep, going through a painstakingly and obviously broken, lengthy check in process. Said her coworker ""had to go do something.""Great location and the $$ is right ($125+$17 for parking/city owned garage). Old and needs remodeling, noisy walls and outside traffic. The trolley stops on Meeting St allow you to leave your car in the garage. Friendly staffVery nice staff nice rooms clean lots of space plus breakfast right in the middle of the historical city lots of indoor parking however there is a $15 charge the tourist bureau is right across the street and one block to the main street. It's at Hampton Inn so you can expect something good insideWe made reservations several weeks early as we were going to zip through Charleston for one night.  We arrived around 2:00 pm and were told the room wouldn't be ready until 4:00 pm.  We went exploring the historic district and was kind of shocked to see how far the drive was to the real historic area, would not of been able to walk that and back before dark.We grabbed dinner so we didn't get back until 7:00 pm assuming that was more than enough time for our room to be ready. Managed to snag the one last parking spot (not sure where we would of been directed to if the lot was full). We were given the cards for 619 and liked the fact we were going to be up high with a good view.  Off we went dragging along our luggage in an elevator that smelled like cigarette smoke, only to find a family taking care of a baby and another child running in and out of 619.  Back to the counter we went.Frantically we were given a new room, 339.  Believe me when I say this is a hike!  Up the smoke smelling elevator again we had to jog around a dozen or more room service carts as it appeared the whole floor was being cleaned at once.  I counted off the paces from the elevator, 110 paces approximately 330-feet, longer than walking the length of an NFL football field, and passing over three dozen EMPTY rooms, dodging around the dozen carts and passing by all the cleaning staff along the way.  By the second round trip we were spent and ended up spending the entire evening sitting in the room with the peeling wallpaper in the bathroom as we didn't want to deal with any more hassle nor what we would of faced with a full parking lot.In the morning we looked but there was no hotel information at all in the room for breakfast or anything.  So we went back the football field length hike to the smoke scented elevator, down to the breakfast room where we paid almost $20 for two little muffins and a two cups of coffee.  Couldn't wait to get the heck out of this place.Three stars for location (I walked to all my destinations in charleston when I stayed here), friendly staff, decent breakfast, and multiple charging ports in the room.  Minus2 stars for noise... Hard to get quality sleep when you can hear the traffic outside and the plumbing in your neighbors bathroom.My overnight stay with my partner at the Hampton Inn was terrific! It smelled of fresh prunes and had terrific service, though the Coca-Cola machine did not work, hence my frustration. Because of the machine, this is no longer a five star hotel, but a four star one.Stayed here for an evening on a short trip with the family. The staff was really good and provided great information on some local businesses. The location was great for walking everywhere. The value was what I expected for the location. We'll probably stay here again.After a long morning of Kayaking down in Bowens Island, we were exhausted as we had to hastely wake up, pack up and move out of the Inn of Charleston, at the Air Force Base... and on top of that we hadn't planned on hitting any traffic on our way to go Kayaking. Needless to say, by the end of our 2hr morning Kayaking session we were dog tired! We desperately needed to find a place to stay, and we wanted to get cleaned up really bad, as we were very salty from our romp in the Marsh! After a bit of searching on yelp, I was about to call a very pricy B&amp;B, but the GF said why don't you give Hampton a call (which was also on my list, but not 1st choice). So I gave them a call, and I spoke with a gentleman named Kevin. He quoted me a price that was already cheaper than what we found on Expedia, travelocity, or whatever online garbage we were looking at. And then I asked if he could offer me a Military discount, or AAA discount. And man did he ever give us a great Bargain! I without hesitation agreed to take it. He was extremely Helpful, and polite. He even gave us a better address than what was listed to put into our gps! And when we arrived, the beautiful ladies at the front desk were so polite, charming and helpful... They explained all the amenities that the hotel had to offer to include the free breakfast, and the hours of the gym, pool, and business center... and their southern twang, and beautiful southern belle apperance made my heart skip 10 beats!!!So after putting our bags away, and moving the car up to the garage I had to go check out the pool. Which was just outside the main lobby, in a very pretty, and quaint courtyard. My only complaint thus far is that the pool is fairly dirty with leaves, and pollen junk etc. I am very thrilled with this hotels location, and its close proxcimity to the king st bars. So we can have a few drinks this evening, and not have to worry about driving!Also a major plus for us was that they allowed us to check in 2 hours early. Which was fantastic, because like I said before we were very salty and yearning for a shower from our crazy Kayaking excursion in the Marsh...We have enjoyed visiting Charleston every January for the past 7 years.  We make it a point to stay at the Hampton Inn-Historic District.  The staff is great and helpful  in every way possible.  The community areas are clean, and the breakfasts are a nice way to get the morning started.  The hotel is located directly across from the Visitor Center, and the free trolleys run unitl 9 p.m.I would have given more stars if it weren't for the following: the room we stayed in the first night smelled strongly of mold/mildew.  When we complained, the room was sprayed with deodorizer and an air purifier was furnished.  The problem is not the air; the problem is moldy carpet, walls or furniture.  The air purifier did not work!!  We asked for a new room the next morning, and the staff immediately relocated us.   Let me be clear, my complaint is not with the staff - their service is great.  My complaint is that the underlying problem with that particular room needs to be addressed by replacing the smelly carpent, followed by a deep steam cleaning and drying of the room.Very comfortableOutstanding staffBreakfast goodRooms clean and comfortable beddingWould returnI was seriously underwhelmed by this hotel.  I was incredibly surprised by the smell of decades and decades of stale cigarette smoke in the lobby and rooms - I haven't encountered that in a long time at a major chain hotel.  The carpets felt damp and dirty on our feet - we wore flip flops at all times in the room.  We had to kill a cockroach in the bathroom in our first thirty seconds in the room.  The shower head was hilariously dysfunctional.  And the decor, from the '80s silk flowers in the hallway to the depressing paintings on the walls, was drab and sad, and repairs in evidence were clearly focusing more on holding the building together than on modernization.  That being said, the staff was really nice.Wonderful place to stay in historic Charleston.  Very clean and super friendly.  Offers complimentary water for you outings out.Rooms were very clean and the staff was very helpful. It was nice to have breakfast taken care off every morning so it was one less expense. You can't be the location. We were able to walk everywhere and didn't need to rent a car.Charleston is one of those places that is saturated with great places to stay. The Hampton Inn is a great place at a great price! I stayed here for a night while working in the area. The Hampton is walking distance to everything you want and nestled in the heart of Charleston. We arrived a the smell of hot chocolate chip cookies in the foyer as we checked in. The staff were gracious and accommodating to my request fo a room that is high and away from the elevators. The room was large, and yet quaint and comfy. Free wifi, and a window with a view. It can get sort of noisy with the live music so if you are there to go to bed really early, this may not be the place for you. For me, it was fine. My room was clean and bed was super comfy.The breakfast.... holy crap! If you walk away from this breakfast hungry, there is something wrong. There were lots and lots of options to choose from. Hot and cold food and drink items, and a plethora of fresh fruits to nosh on. I look forward to returning to the Hampton in Charleston, either for business or pleasure. Southern hospitality at its best!We had a really nice stay here. Family of five (including one preschoolert) on vacation exploring Charleston. Great location, literally across the street from all three free trolley stops and the visitor center.  We did walk back from the Market area once, which was a little long but very doable. The trolleys are nice to catch, and they are pretty frequent. We paid a little more for a room that had a door to the cool courtyard and pool area, which we were glad we did. Room was plenty spacious. A little older place, but very well maintained. Spacious lobby and (free) breakfast area. Breakfast, by the way, was changed up just a little every day, which was a nice touch. We even caught afternoon cookies one day. Staff that went out of their way to be friendly, often greeting us with, ""Hey guys! How was your day?"" Or, ""Where are you off to this evening?"" Generous with loaner umbrellas and bottled water, too.Just a very nice stay and reasonable rates. Cool location and atmosphere.The Hampton Inn is in a great location for walking around Charleston. And if you get tired a pedi-cab ride home should never cost you more than 11 bones, which is nice. Especially since walking plus carrying a baby can really tire you (me) out. AND they are right across the street from the free shuttle stops that take you around the city which is awesome if you time your leaving just right.Besides the location the rooms are pretty nice, there is a pool, and they have a decent continental breakfast, even offering ""to-go"" bags filled with a muffin and fruit if you're in a hurry and not going out to breakfast somewhere in the city.The downside is there is no bar for drinks and no restaurant for room service. And there are no mini-fridges for storing beers you may bring back to the room. Other than that I can't think of any complaints.You do have to pay to park in a garage as they don't have their own parking, but it's $12 for 24 hours which doesn't really seem that bad to me. All in all, it's a good place to stay in historic Charleston if you aren't looking for a cute bed and breakfast or boutique hotel experience.Being our first time staying overnight in Charleston, we wanted to make sure that the hotel we chose would be comfortable, close to shopping and dining, clean and affordable.  This hotel definitely met all of those standards.  We rented 1 room with a king size bed and pull out couch for 2 adults and 3 children (2, 4, &amp; 10).  We were given a handicap accessible room, which was great!  The room was HUGE, the beds were pretty comfy (I hate staying in hotels bc the bed we have at home has spoiled me), there was a fridge, microwave, desk, nice large bathroom and a view of the pool from our room.  I also loved that they served a large breakfast buffet, really helped us save money on food while in the city.  The first day we were there we parked in the parking garage next to the hotel ($14/day) and didn't touch our car again until it was time to leave.  The children's museum was directly across the street, right next door was a fantastic restaurant called Coast, a gelato place and a french bakery.  Then around the corner was tons of shopping, a beautiful park where there was a market/festival set up.  It really was the PERFECT location.  The staff was great too.  When we arrived our room was not yet ready so they took our bags and locked them up in the back office so we could go grab some food.  There were always willing to offer suggestions for dining and activities.  My 2 year old hurt himself in the elevator at one point and they rushed to help us.  There was even one of the staff that baked cookies everyday at 5:30pm (which the kids LOVED).  We will definitely be back when we stay in Charleston again.","The absolute best choice for a very reasonably-priced hotel in the historic area. It's not incredibly fancy, like all Hampton Inns, but the historic building is loaded with charm and it's within walking distance to the Battery, lots of great restaurants and many historic sites. Charleston is consistently rated as the most polite city in the US and the staff here delivers on that reputation. The breakfast is filling and complimentary, but you may want to get there early before the vultures descend, picking it clean and taking up all the tables. The lemony ice water offered in the lobby is also refreshing in the hot humid summer weather. Yes, you have to pay for parking but considering the location it is very reasonable.First time I stayed in Charleston I came here. 100% recommend. Great spot in the city in the heart of the upper king restaurant scene. Great location, great service. I always recommend and it's reasonably priced!We stayed here during a family visit to Charleston.  Although parking was 12$ daily, and there was no option for valet, AND the fact that it is on the outskirts of the main historic district, it provided a fine stay for the price. The hotel is across the street from the visitor's center, which Is a nice feature if you are interested in taking any tours either through Charleston or to Fort Sumter.  The free trolley stops virtually at the front door, so this location is definitely nice for leaving your car and either walking or taking advantage of public transportation.  There are also some great eats nearby, with Coast Bar and Grill next door and several yummy treat shops down the street. Also, if you stay here, don't miss happy hour down the street at Joe Pasta. Their cocktails were stiff and at a great price. Regarding the hotel itself, it was fine. We stayed in a suite with a mini fridge and a microwave, which was a nice touch. Also, the complimentary breakfast each morning met our expectations and was a nice way to save a few bucks. Unfortunately, due to the weather we were unable to use the pool, but it looked very relaxing. Overall, a pleasant experience. Unless you want to splurge on a boutique hotel, this Hampton Inn offers excellent value and a pleasant stay.After staying accross the street at the Embassy Suites, this place was junk.  The room was 1/3 the size and I was lucky enough to have construction on my hallway and I had to navigate the hotel map to find my room.  The front desk made no mention at check in about the painting 2 doors down and offered no appoligies.  I am glad I spent 1 night.  Stay at the Embassy Suites right accross the street.Great location!  The room was a little small but the bathroom was a nice size.  The facility seemed new and everything was very clean.  The bed was very comfortable and their breakfast was great.  We had just checked out of the Marriott which was in great disrepair and smelled bad.  It was a pleasure to stay here.I've stayed at a lot, and I do mean a lot of Hampton Inns, but this one is the best. It has a perfect location in the heart of the historic district of Charleston. The lobby is huge, which is perfect for meeting guests, and the room I ended with, #146 is one of the largest rooms I have ever had in any hotel including those of the St. Regis and the Ritz. For a Hampton, however, it is a little on the pricey side, but worth it.We stayed here for 2 nights and chose the hotel mostly for it's excellent location. It was close to just about everything- in fact we didn't even have to take the car out at all the entire time we were there. We walked to dinners, museums, and shopped on kings street.      The hotel was clean and the room was spacious. It was a little pricey for a Hampton Inn- 149 per night. The one thing that I found unpleasant was we woke up to an army of ants crawling all over a cookie we had in a plastic container- gross! The staff quickly took care of it and sprayed- but it was still enough for me not to want to bring any leftovers back to the room. Staff was very friendly. I probably wouldn't stay here again, even though the location was wonderful.Gracious, efficient, and convenient, with a bonus of lovely grounds.  Location is terrific -- at the northern end of the historic district, and very convenient to the razzle-dazzle on King Street PLUS the tourist bureau, across the street and several of the walking-tour sites within a block or two.Arrival parking, entry and check-in are perfect; with convenient, indoor, long-term parking at $14 daily. Indoor-outdoor breakfast buffet is a step-up from routine chain motel breakfasts, but not Zagat. Roomy, pleasant lobby-slash-dining area (Why don't they offer pm bar and snacks there?).  Pool is 100% clean and very pleasant!  Concierge advice was spot-on for us. A+!Decor and furnishings in halls and rooms are somewhat generic, but not at all shabby. Our room was clean and perfect. Note: Ask for the pros and cons before booking a ground-floor, pool-side room.Another Note: Hampton's ""800"" reservation service reported no vacancies, but phoning the Inn directly got us the booking we sought.I have to agree with the 7 other reviewers (the good and not so good comments). The location is primo (like most real estate), the rooms 2nd and then the amenities (free breakfast and WI-FI).It is close to or have easy transportation to all the tourist type attractions. The 3 free trolley lines have stops very near by. The Visitors Center and the Children's Museum is in next block. Your are 1 walking block from King Street with lots of restaurants, shops and bars. There are at least 3 restaurants with decent ratings within ""shout-in"" distance, as us southerners would say. There are 5 floors and 3 modern elevators. Like another reviewer said, lumpy but nice duvet bed cover.Yes, the WI-FI download service is slow &amp; the TV service suck. Getting a TV show on-line is not worth the effort because of buffering delays. There is no pay-for-view TV service. One Showtime channel is the only premium station (no HBO). The room has a newer digital capable flat screen TV. However, all the channels showing were analog. Seems like a waste. (I tinkered with the menu and did not find a HD channel.)  I hope they the IT person knows that we know the difference. The shows were grainy and definitely not HD quality. We should have been sight seeing but with the heat index 100+ and warnings to stay inside; we spent more time inside the hotel than planned. Okay, rant over. That is my 1 demerit item.Nice sizable, rooms. Breakfast is very adequate, saving the cost of 1 meal. The eating space &amp; lobby is attractive. Friendly staff. Clean hotel. Nice courtyard and pool area. We'll be back........; in cooler weather next time. I hope they upgrade the TV service but it is not really a show stopper for me.The staff and location were great. The room was small and could use some serious renovations. The walls are thin. If you are expecting to has wifi in your room, think again!  The signal in my 4th floor room was nonexistent. We could hear the people in the adjacent room watching television and talking. I certainly didn't enjoy my cold shower on Sunday morning. The next time I am in town, I'll stay somewhere else.The hotel is well located... There are great restaurants and shops within a comfortable walking distance. Their prices are high for what you get, though. We were greeted with a roach in our bathroom climbing on our toiletries. They ultimately comped our night in the room and moved us the next day which my wife really appreciated. However, the room we were moved to was dark, didn't have a fridge like our first room and ultimately not as nice as the first one. Parking is $14.00 day in the adjacent garage but that's par for the course in Charleston, parking is an issue all over the city. The breakfast was not good and suggest you look elsewhere. There is a market close by on Saturday mornings in the summer that has great food vendors among other things.The Hampton is definitely a little pricey compared to some of your other options around, but there are a few advantages to staying here.Pros:-Right in the middle of the city; walking distance from a bunch of cool things-Once parked, you probably won't need to move-Clean rooms, plenty of towels-Comfortable beds-SUPER nice staff. No joke-Free WIFI-Complimentary breakfastCons:-Parking is $12 for up to 24 hours. This is a separate garage right next to the Hampton. -A floor of non-smoking rooms are still getting 'aired out'. A small reference to the non-smoking rooms - we were initially placed in one which reeked of smoke, but were switched without hassle. The room we ended up staying in still had a slight hint of leftover smoke, but will probably dissipate with time.I wasn't a fan of most the items at the complimentary breakfast. While plentiful, I felt the quality was lacking. However, I can't complain about the overall quality of my stay, which I must admit was very enjoyable.Tip: When you get to the hotel, just park in the small lot outside the lobby, check-in, bring all your stuff into your room, then park in the garage. It'll make your life easier.Our reservations were lost, but the hotel was very nice. It was walking distance to everything, which was great. Parking is extra, but that is the case for all the hotels downtown.One of the surprises for me regarding Charleston was just how high the hotel prices are. This Hampton Inn was one of the lower priced options near the Historic District and...it was great. A block off King Street, lots of easy access to fantastic restaurants. Very close to Rhett Aikens house, right next to the very charming Charleston museum. Hotel was clean, we lucked out with the quiet factor, staff was very friendly and helpful.  We had a small issue in that they had switched over from air to heat but it was a 80 degree day. Maintenance was there within minutes of our call to switch our room back. Would stay at again if I'm back in the area.When a group of ladies from out of town roll in with 3 bellhop cart fulls of items, with 1 of them being completely full of alcohol, it is the TRUE test of a hotel, service and amenities.Being in town for a bachelorette party, we chose the Hampton Inn Historic since it honored Hilton Rewards and was centrally located to all the hot spots we wanted to hit (O-Ku, Chai's Loungue, Club Pantheon @ night, The Market &amp; King St during the day).Upon early check in, we had a super sweet bellhop who seemed to really enjoy his job - and that makes such a difference! The room was nice and cool upon entry, spacious enough for a group of 4, with a clean bathroom (with granite!) and a courtyard view.Throughout our 3 day stay, the staff and front desk staff were always on call, pleasant and attempted to fufill our every wish: do you have a cd player we could borrow? sorry, no. can we have 6 extra towels, 4 extra pillows, 4 sets of toilettries and 3 toothbrushes? yes! and delivered within 5 minutes. We didn't eat much breakfast but upon leaving we tried it and it was good - turkey sausage, lots of cereal and yogurt options, and a self-serve waffle maker which we all enjoyed fiddling with :) Of course, the true mark of a great hotel is what happened when we left 4 evening dresses in the closet - they overnighted them to us (thought we did pay for it!) and was very easy to deal with.Overall, a great location, nice hotel, good staff and the parking wasn't stupidly expensive ($12). I'd definitely come back again!This hotel was prime location to farmer's market, king street, trolly stop, great restaurants- couldn't be better!  The room was so clean and designed with quality.  Breakfast was a great spread- staff was so pleasant and helpful!  Truly enjoyed this stay- the only thing I would foreworn about is the parking which is not managed by the hotel but by the city- very rude, mistrusting, and I was inconvenienced upon departure by a mistake on their record keeping.  Parking is $14/nt for hotel guests but honestly if you have an opportunity, bring your vehicle elsewhere, I hate to support places that lack customer service.  No reflection on the hotel though- they were top notch!We got the best room in the house, top floor corner room! Very pleased with the staff, they were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was decent and the bed was soooo comfortable!In the typical Hampton Inn fashion, this hotel was very good. The rooms were clean, the hotel was clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Of course, you can't beat the free wi-fi and the free breakfast! In fact, the breakfast at this Hampton Inn was much better then ones I have stayed in before. Also, this hotel did not have the extremely loud and annoying window air conditioning unit. But the hotel wasn't perfect. The TV in the room runs off of DirectTV. This is normally okay, but when heavy clouds or rain comes in, forget about watching TV, the signal drops. And to make matters worse, there was a large thunderstorm while staying at the hotel. The building was struck by lighting followed by a large power surge. Then the fire alarms went off. Luckily, the power surge had caused them to trigger and not a fire.Perfectly serviceable and well located hotel.  The sheets and linens could be updated a bit but that is my only really negative.  And even that...for most hotels of Hampton Inn level these would be about the same, the thing is that especially when Charleston has an event, hotel prices go through the roof--so for a Hampton in, everything was fine. for the price they charged I'd expect a little more.Free coffee and breakfast, and free internet, that is a good deal, though!And a very good location.Great service, Great hotel and the staff is the best! Great area with access to museums and restaurant/bars.","Great place to stay for a reasonable price and location in the heart of the historic district of Charleston. A few blocks from all the restaurants and shops- easy to walk to because parking can get expensive. There is no private parking on premises but a city owned lot next to it--- $14.00 a day to park- pretty steep so keep that in mind when you are pricing out your rooms per day. But overall worth it in comparison to other hotels in the area that jack up the prices for the rooms but give you free parking. Nice hotel, clean rooms with fluffy pillows and of course--- free breakfast.Awesome value. Perfect location. Friendliest southern hospitality. Clean rooms. Comfy beds. Abundant breakfast included. Great rates.Stay at Hampton for the wonderful service! The employees treat you like you're staying at the Ritz. The staff are absolutely wonderful, professional and very friendly. There's a lot of singing and laughter that gone on here. The rooms are comfy and a little small and noisy on the first floor. But no one complained when we requested a room change or a late check out. The amenities include breakfast and free internet (FREE! Some higher-end hotels don't even included free internet) HIHD is also very close to shopping, nightlife and public transportation. It was in walking distance of art galleries, rows of antiques stores, clothing stores and trendy restaurants.Hotel is great for walking to all of the things Charleston has to offer. Its a bit on the outskirts, but still very close to city center. King Street is close. The best part is the pool and its court yard. The staff was friendly, and upgraded us to a king suite over looking the pool, which was fantastic because it also had a walk out to the pool. (Only first floor rooms have direct outside access). There are lovely restaurants close by 39 Rue de Jean is right around the corner and offers an excellent French Cuisine.Rooms were very clean but had standing water in the shower...everything else great!Comfortable beds, great breakfast and wonderful location.Pros:  -Nice court yard with a pool.  -Super friendly staff.-Good location-More upscale than your usual Hampton Inn-Clean rooms-Parking garage right outside-Right next door to Coast Bar &amp; Grill.  Great restaurant.-(For Hilton Honors members) We were able to stay here for free by using Hilton points.Cons:- A/C is noisy and runs constantly.  Typical for most hotels and an area for improvement in my opinion.  At least it was the ""central air"" type and not the console types that go under the window.- Rooms are pretty standard.  No mini-fridge.- (not really a con) While it's situated down town, there are other more centrally located hotels (however, I can't vouch for their quality).  Expect a brisk walk to get to ""hot spots"" in town.  It's still right off King street so there's plenty of stuff around.  - Breakfast is rather cheap/usual.  Faux eggs and juices, yogurts, cereal, fruit.  Hey, it's free.  No complaints really.  -Parking deck is $12 per day.  Seems steep but it is convenient and still probably cheaper overall.  Getting out of it is a little bit of nuisance since they have to check your ticket, have you pay, and reissue a new ticket each day.  If there are a couple cars in front of you expect to wait about 15 minutes.The staff took great care of us, after an amusing start finding the room they had assigned was already occupied (not their fault - a guest had stayed past his booking and not advised anyone.) Comfortable room, good choices for breakfast and staff that were right on top of any request.  Being across from the main stop for the free shuttles meant we didn't miss a car and didn't need many taxis. The restaurants close by were terrific, and when we wanted to reserve for dinner the hotel took care of us.  At the end, we had a taxi driver try to over-charge us - Brandon, the manager was all over that, making calls and generally raising hell.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to see Charleston without a car.updating my rating to a little better because it has a great free breakfast--very impressed.  Internet slooooow, room smells like paint, overall it LOOKS ok-to-nice...it's clean, my room is yellowed white with pleasant, typical decore--has a pool, nice people working here.  But the bed duvets have this seriously strange lumpyness to them (under covers the beds are comfy, but on top of duvet it feels like a little like finding a comfortable spot on a camels back).  There is no free parking.  Did I mention it smells like fresh paint in my room?  I'm going to stay here and pay the expense because i'm like ""whatever"" about it, but it's not impressive in a good way...You know, the hotel is OK - big, clean rooms, free wifi, and has a great location. But what's wonderful about this hotel is the staff.  The staff went above and beyond helping us with directions, taxis, and what to do about our lost luggage. What a great staff...Best Hampton Inn I've stayed in. It's in a beautiful historic building and has the beautiful, original hardwood floors. Rooms looked recently renovated and were very clean. Bigger bathrooms than most Hamptons. Great pool in a nice courtyard and fitness center is nice too. The staff is very friendly and they went above and beyond to make our stay more enjoyable. The hotel is also Very conveniently located in downtown, It backs up to King Street.I usually always stay at Hampton Inn's because of the clean rooms, free breakfast and free WiFi. This hotel had all those amenities plus extremely friendly staff, &amp; a door bell hop who was very helpful. Was very close to lots of shops &amp; restaurants AND the Charleston visitor center was right across the street so anything you need to know about the city was there. It has a parking deck attached to it which was great but it costs $14 per day(can come &amp; go as you please) and some of the staff at the garage entrance are extremely rude. I reported the rudeness to hotel staff &amp; was told that the garage is owned by the city &amp; they would report the incident...so I'm not holding the rudeness against the hotel. The garage is safe, well lit and once parked you can pretty much walk to anything. The only thing I would complain about is the elevators...EXTREMELY HOT &amp; SLOW. If you can..take the stairs.",,,"['inn', 'location', 'located', 'historic', 'district', 'downtown', 'conveniently', 'located', 'near', 'major', 'shopping', 'centers', 'king', 'street', 'well',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-charleston-riverview-charleston-4,Holiday Inn Charleston-Riverview,3.0,$$,51,"'Ello chaps!Holiday Inn Charleston - Riverview is well situated along the Ashley River on the edge of downtown Charleston. It's location makes it easy to get to downtown or wherever in the area you may need to get to. The hotel, iconic and well known in the area, is in good shape overall. It seemed to be well maintained and modern. You have got to also love the views offered by this hotel of downtown.In town for a conference and it had potential being a water view hotel. Overall the footprint and thus floors are small. The entire building is columnar, including the lobby. The rooms are wedges and are appointed consistent with the star rating and price point. Everything worked and there were no glaring areas of repair needed.Room service was timely, decently priced and made as ordered. Interestingly the next day housekeeping left the old tray and plates. Had to put them outside before they were collected. The view will vary on where you are on the circle. I was looking to the north over the city and river. Not a bad view, but he balcony door is permanently bolted shut so points lost there. The in and out getting to the parking lot from the main road is a little like a NASCAR pit stop and you need to be careful getting out onto the main road as traffic is approaching at a good clip and there's limited visibility around the corners.Overall 3/5, would probably try somewhere different next time but no overt reason Not to chose this locale of the price is right that night.We stayed at the Holiday Inn Charleston-Riverview for a friend's wedding. They were offering her a group rate of $159 a night. I had booked it before the deadline for the group. When I was finalizing plans and looking up the address, I just did a quick search for the nights we were staying. I realized that it was $70 cheaper than what they were charging me with the group rate. I called and they had to cancel my reservation and not guarantee I would be with the group - but I said I didn't care. I feel like it's bad business to give a wedding group that's bringing A LARGE GROUP OF MULTIPLE rooms to your business a rate that's higher than what they could book outside the group. The weekend we stayed we never had a room key. They said that the Waffle House next door had fried their key machine. All weekend long we had to be let into our rooms. However, they had no system in place. I was staying on the 12th floor. On more than one occasion I was waiting 5 minutes or more for someone to let me into my room. Meanwhile, more guest would arrive and need to be let in as well. We would all pile into the elevator and rather than being let into my room first because I was waiting the longest - we would stop at the lowest floor. At one point I had to wait for 3 or 4 other guest to be let into their rooms who arrived AFTER me. They also were not checking IDs with any kind of guest list. I overheard one more than one occasion someone calling the front desk because they had opened the wrong room. I can be understanding of circumstances out of their control with the key machine but you need to have a system in place for that situation. The bathroom consisted of a toilet and tub/shower in one room and the sink out connected to the rest of the room. The toilet/shower room had no ventilation which made it awful inside the bathroom after anyone showered. Overall, I wasn't impressed with my stay at this Holiday Inn location. I am sure my friend who was getting married would have chosen a different location if she had known all of this. Others who are considering blocking off this hotel for guest if you're getting married - I would suggest finding another hotel!I stayed here for a cross country trip and would usually never stay at a place like this. Here's what went wrong:- my room smelled like urine- bed bugs (I cried)- the pool gate was literally held together by zip ties- the vending machine didn't work after I put money in it- you can't even open the door to the balcony because it's nailed shut and has danger signs posted all over it. So if you were considering this place because of the view DONT- the rooms are tiny and triangular- dirtyI stayed here 3 nights a week for 15 weeks while working in Charleston.  Very clean hotel and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  There are a few negatives of this hotel. They do not serve a continental breakfast and the pool is about the size of a hot tub.  All said and done this hotel was just a place for me to lay my head at night and the fact that it was clean with good service was all I needed.Very nice stay. Was there between 30-May &amp; 05-June 2015The staff were friendly and informative. The very top 14th floor is where the restaurant is located, good food , on the expensive side, but the buffet was comped. Will be back.I have stayed here twice before and decided I would have my guests stay here. I spoke with Tammy the manager and she was extremely rude. She didn't find a reason to give a discount to 20 people. Must of had a bad day but she lost a huge amount of customers. Keep the quality of hospitality going in Charleston and find a different hotel. Hopefully they will find a better staff.Best view in charleston! We love this place. You can't find a better view of downtown. We like sitting in the bar area. One of the best burgers in town. Salad is great as well it is a nice spring mix and isn't loaded down with cheap iceberg lettuce. Happy hour from 4-7pm Monday - Saturday. Bartender &amp; server were fantastic.Horrifying!!! Generally old, rundown hotel. Great views but that won't make up for the state of disrepair that this hotel is in. I would best describe it as a project in a ghetto. We didn't even dare sleep under the covers. Just awful. Spend a few extra dollars and go anywhere else!!!!! Btw - had to give it a star to post this. Otherwise there would not be a star on this review.We stayed at the Holiday Inn Riverview for the weekend and we had a fantastic time! Check in was easy, the room was clean and the employees were so nice. On Friday night we came into the restaurant looking for desert five minutes before it was time to close. The manager was very kind and let us order desert. Our waitress Josephine was so polite and on point with getting us served and even worked 30 minutes over to serve us and did not seemed bothered by it at all. The view from the restaurant is amazing! We would stay here again and again...also, the drive to the beach is so easy and to Charleston was about a 10 minute drive! Great location!I'm a very experienced Road Warrior and I spent a week here.  I know my hotels and after a week I know this one quite well.* This property is over 40 years old and therefore somewhat dated but it is well maintained.* The views from the rooftop bar/restaurant are absolutely stunning and probably the biggest asset here.  The bar drinks are reasonably priced and the staff is friendly.  The happy hour food specials are way above average.  The restaurant menu is typical basic American but the quality is a notch better than most.* Most properties of this caliber have an indoor pool and/or Jacuzzi or hot tub.  This property has and outdoor pool only and it's closed for the winter months.  This could be a deal breaker for some folks.* The $10 breakfast buffet is solid and one again the views are take-your-breath-away amazing!* It's a very easy drive into town and they also have a free very convenient shuttle.The pool is not a big deal for me so I'm going to go 4 stars for my experience.  If you are a pool aficionado I can understand how you might say 3.It was very difficult finding a reasonable priced hotel in the Charleston area. We chose this hotel specifically for the free shuttle and the pretty view of the water. However, the shuttle was pretty annoying due to the fact that the bus ran every couple hours, and by the time you showed up for the bus (which holds about 12 people) there was a crowd already waiting. There is no formal line so people would just crowd in to get on the bus. I really think they need to have a formal line or give numbers to people waiting for the bus. I was disappointed that this hotel didn't provide continental breakfast either. Most Holiday Inn's do provide Continental Breakfast. The beds were really soft, too soft. And I am usually not a complainer....so this bed was so soft I had to sleep on top of pillows to give me that lift! We spent 4 nights in Charleston, I definetly would have cut it down to 2 nights. I was expecting the city to be much more larger and charm.Great convenient location to Downtown Charleston without downtown pricing...free parking...outdoor pool.  Complimentary shuttle services available to downtown.Very cordial staff here,  I've stayed here before in one of the renovated king rooms facing the Charleston harbor and downtown.  Have dined in the rooftop restaurant many times over the years for breakfast, lunch, and dinner including holidays and have never had a bad meal.  I like sitting by the window and enjoying the great view of the water.  Only downside was room windows not as soundproof as up in the restaurant ?Enjoyed an appetizer and drinks there this past weekend.  I chose  the crabmeat and crackers.  There was plenty for two people with crabmeat left over.  Took a few bites of my boyfriend's cheeseburger which was excellent.   The crabmeat was mixed in shredded cheese and not sure what dressing mixture was holding the two together.I liked it and the two kinds of ample amount of crackers served with it, but it was not quite over the top . Found myself desiring a bit of dillweed or perhaps paprika and maybe a few drops of lemon to mix it with.   Guess I could have asked, but decided to just add salt/pepper and was almost totally satisfied.  Pleasant evening without a noisy crowd, will definitely keep coming back.Clean, great view, got a cheaper rate by calling hotel directly, upgraded us as we checked in - maybe because it was a 1 night weeknight stay.Brought back memories.  I used to bring my daughters there at night for virgin daiquiris.  They loved it and it had a great view. I was there for a luncheon with a buffet.  I was amazed that it really hadn't changed in the 10 years I have not been there.  The buffet was pretty darn good.  Fried Chicken and Carved Roast Beast.  Good selection of salad fixins as well.  And still a fantastic view.  It always seems strange to me the lack of business it does and that is why I am sure that the luncheon was able to go there.  I still love the view, location, and heck, decent food.  Glad they are still around.  Might bring my daughters soon for non-virgin daiquiris soon!This hotel is good for saving you some money vs. the hotels downtown.  We stayed here our first night, because our hotel in the city was booked.The staff here are actually really friendly and helpful.  They are the main reason I would think about coming back here.  As far as the facilities, the rooms are in decent condition, but the walls felt pretty thin. The ice machine in the hallway kept us up all night, as well as anyone who walked past the room.If you want to save a few bucks, this place isn't bad, but if you are staying for a vacation, kick in the extra money to stay at a cool place downtown.The hotel is well located. Of the multiple Holiday Inn/Expresses in the Charleston area, this is the one on Savannah Highway just over the bridge from the Historic District. It's not walkable to downtown Charleston but as a result is significantly cheaper. While I think you need a car to best explore this city as many things to see/do are outside the CBD, you don't need a car to get to the Historic District as the hotel runs a regular free shuttle. The last run, however, is 9:30 PM so it may not be late enough for some evening activities.Ridiculously good value, no reason to pay center city premium as the HI Express isn't much more walkable.Small fitness center and outdoor pool on the 3rd floor. Wasn't warm enough to use the outdoor pool but fitness center was in good condition. Only a few machines but even with hotel nearly full, was non issue. ATM in the lobby and basic brochures. Free WiFi throughout hotel and guest rooms.Top floor restaurant/bar for all meals + evening lounge and an amazing views. Breakfast was a well priced buffet at $9.99/person. Didn't take advantage of other meals. Free coffee / tea in the lobby in the mornings.ROOMS: good amount of space for two people and love that sink is outside the bathroom for ease of getting ready. Bizarre lights in that one switch controlled both spaces and no fan, led to very humid bathroom after showers. Rooms have balconies but doors are sealed so you can't access. Plenty of outlets.This hotel is not the normal Holiday Inn the rooms are tight and not as clean as normally expected for Holiday Inn but what a great view at their restaurant upstairs do not get the breakfast bar 995 spend your money elsewhere and go out for breakfast the staff are nice if you used a coupon that you get from the travel books it is only good for one nightLet's just call the hotel ""retro""...at least from the exterior! I stayed here for the 2014 Cooper River Bridge Run and was pleased. Yes, it was more expensive this weekend than it's worth...but all hotels are! The room was clean, the front desk staff and housekeeping staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the bed was comfortable &amp; soft.  Nice bar at the top, great views of the river, free shuttle downtown and free parking! Free internet. May not have all the ""bells and whistles"" but a good location and affordable. Recommended.So, I had the worst travel day ever. Hours of flight delays, then a cancellation, lost luggage, and having to drive three and a half hours to Charleston.That being said, this was a great hotel to have this sort of crisis in, I arrived at midnight, and the front desk staff was very kind. They collected as many toiletries as they could for me since my luggage was lost and offered to work with the airport to have it delivered.The room was clean, large, and incredibly comfortable. The bed seemed heavenly, though that could have just been how tired I was.One detractor: the showers were not made for someone of my height (5'10), so if you are taller, forget having a comfortable shower. Also, at 5:30 in the morning the water wouldn't heat and was only lukewarm.Otherwise, great stay!","While the hotel has a beautiful view of the river, the hotel itself is JANKY!  There was only one working elevator that was full every time we tried to get on it. In the end, we used the stairs even with all our luggage.  The rooms were very small and out dated. The bathroom shower didn't drain and left you attending in foot water. The toilet didn't flush well. Just run down and we could have spent our money someplace else.Got a decent deal on priceline for this place. I realized that I've stayed there before.  The only issue I had was the double bed that I was given for me and two kids.  the front desk offered a rollaway, so I cant be angry, its just not what I was supposed to get. Also the doors to the room don't close easily. We returned from dinner to realize the door was still actually open.  I should have double checked but it felt closed whne we left.The hotel is older, but its nice.  I had an issue getting where I needed to go as it is situated between the N and S of US 17 but you can only leave going North. Again, another quirk, but it was okay.The restaurant was nice.  The front desk provided Kids Free coupons that helped me tremendously w dinner and breakfast.  The view was fantastic and held my kids attention for both meals. Although dinner was nice, the $10 breakfast buffet was GREAT.  We ate well.My overall experience was good.  I've downtown before  and I wasnt paying what the folks at Folly wanted for one night.  This place was a good go-between. Solid.For what we paid for this hotel on orbitz, I am so pleased! I've seen this hotel countless times on my way to folly but normally we go for the day. I was extremely nervous to stay several nights as the hotel is a little old looking from the road. The rooms are clean and updated. The TV and fridge are really nice. We didn't pay for a harbor view but can see the boats coming in from our bed. I have no issue letting my 2 year old play on the floor and there's plenty of room for the packandplay in the sink/dressing area- a huge bonus since we can watch TV without disturbing the sleeping toddler. The staff is great, the location can't be beat (we want proximity to Folly, Sullivan's and all downtown), and there is free parking. For $110/night, this way exceeds my expectations.For what they charge, this place is a little too run down and dirty for that.  The staff was all very nice and polite, so they didn't lose any points there.  The carpet reeks in both of the elevators of mildew.  My room had the added amenities of a gnarly yellow fingernail clipping on one nightstand and a spot of Astroglide with a pube in it on the other nightstand, so they obviously didn't clean it well at all.  My room also did not have a mini-fridge or a microwave, pretty much standard fare these days.  Each room has a balcony, but they sealed all the patio doors to them shut ""for your safety"" which is fucking retarded, so if you plan on coming here despite my review bring a #2 phillips screwdriver with you so you can go on the balcony anyhow.  Not that BBJ would ever disobey a sign...The restaurant was a 2 star affair as well.  Were it not for the coupons they gave (essentially making my meals free) I wouldn't have ate there more than once.  Frozen vegetables?  I don't stoop that low when I'm cooking at home.  If you do eat here, they seem to be able to deep fry seafood well at least.  Feel like whoever owns this place is slumlording it.  Collect all the money they can when they should be spending part of the cash renovating things.Great location to downtown and a great view.  I would stay there again!!!Hotel is what you would hope to expect. Although everything is overpriced in Charleston this time of year that's not their fault. The staff has been friendly and efficient and the room is clean. No refrigerator in our room and an armoire serves as a closet.This place was a big disappointment. The value definitely was not there and was not worth the rate I paid. The hotel is run down, the wait staff upstairs in the restaurant acted like they didn't really care to be there, bad overall experience.A/C works great, free parking, good water pressure, hot water can be so so when everyone hits it. Front desk was staffed with nice friendly people. Good recommendations for dinner with directions (Marybeth).  Hotel is old as we have been coming here for over 20 years. They updated carpet, showers, sink. Not sure decided on the sink height, but unless you 6'4"" it's way too high. Flat screen Samsung, HDMI so we could watch stuff off the Laptop . The king bed was one of best I've sleep on. Hotel is a circle, 360 degree view from top floor restaurant. Ice machine was down on our floor for cleaning. Nice to know that do that, but not on one of their busy weekend (really people).  It was down at least 2 days.  Restaurant for breakfast was the worse of all the places we stayed.  Almost no one in the place and the service was SO slow.  Buffet had tons of food made up ahead of time just getting cold. I have never seen eggs cooked in pile before. Like someone can't see the amount of people staying there and cook the food in smaller amounts.  While standing there to decide if I wanted any of this, the staff decided it was the short cut running everything past people trying to get there food (HINT - Walk around and stop running over your customers). Parking lot fills up and getting in and out can be a little tough and traffic can be heavy in each directions.  I don't have a problem with that and the location is easy from either direction.  For the guy who was concerned they closed the slider off so you can't stepon the little balcony.  There a reason for that, it requires major work to rip all the old balconys off and replace them.  With age they will no longer hold your weight, otherwise you could have an express ride to the ground.  Highly recommended the hotel, just eat somewhere else!Good place, friendly staff and great food/room serviceI spent one night here; approximately 8pm-9am. It was clean and well maintained and had beautiful views from every window. The staff was very friendly and helpful both at check-in and check-out. There was free wi-fi (awesome!) and there was a bar/ restaurant on the top floor that was hopping at 9pm on a weeknight. The food was decent and our waitress was super sweet- like seriously the sweetest person I've ever met. I wish there had been the typical free Holiday Inn breakfast, but they did have a buffet for $10 that had a LOT of options. We had no problems while we were there and I find myself flummoxed by some of the negative reviews. I was tempted to give it 4-5 stars purely to even out some of them. This is a great place to stay in Charleston if you have a car and can drive into the city to get closer to the action b/c it is out of the way a little. Overall this was a good place to stay, certainly more comfortable than some and I appreciated the friendly staff and the clean room.If you're not spending the bucks to stay in the cute part of Charleston, this place is fine. It's a quick drive into town. It's an old hotel, somewhat maintained. Think of it as a place to shower and sleep.TIP/COMPLAINT: Don't stay on the floor under the restaurant. The staff drags furniture across the floor after closing (2:00 am in our case) and the noise is unbearable. A call to the front desk was met with indifference and attitude. Unfortunately we had to be up at 4:00 am for the Kiawah Island Marathon. Needless to say, the lack of sleep and the stress of dealing with the front desk made for a poor experience. I won't stay here again, and will pay alot more to stay on Kiawah Island for the marathon next year. You'll be fine however if you end up here.The view is great but the hotel is old. We paid $150 a night for two double beds. The double beds were very uncomfortable for two people. The location is near downtown but too expensive for what they offer.Two stars for the staff, who were extremely friendly and attentive.  Everything else about this place left me underwhelmed, but it's a decent option if you just need a place to sleep, and don't want to stay at the more expensive hotels in town.The hotel is located in between two highways.  It's a quick (5-minute), easy drive into Charleston - but the drive back to the hotel is easily 20-30 minutes at rush hour.  The ""exit ramps"" are very short, so when traffic is moving, getting out of the parking lot is nerve-racking.The room itself was neat and clean, but I was kept awake at night by the sound of traffic and wind (the building is round!).  Although the window/balcony is permanently sealed shut, it was very drafty - and therefore impossible to regulate the temperature inside the room.  Sitting at the desk, I was freezing.  Sitting in bed, sweltering.  The heater kept cycling on and off, which only added to the noise - so I finally just bundled up, and switched the heater to ""fan only"" to create some white noise.On a more positive note, breakfast at the restaurant was good, the view was ok, and the (ridiculously slow) wifi was, mercifully, free.This is just a review for the view from this place! Going to the top floor and having a wonderful lookout over the bay is well worth it. It's a great excuse to get a drink or a bite to eat, just to look at the view. Parking is easy and the crowd is... interesting.This hotel has a great location, off a major highway connected to downtown. The view is beautiful, and the hotel is gorgeous from the outside. With that said, the experience was poor for the amount of money you pay. I usually leave the room after maid service arrives because it takes a while to get my children ready for the day. If you are present when they arrive, maid service is supposed to return later to service your room. They didn't come, and we were left with a pile of garbage and wet towels.Our bedsheets were damp. The bath tub stopped didn't work. I purchased some bath salts from a local store but was disappointed we couldn't use them. The exercise room is tiny, and the pool meager. The wi-fi sucked, and the speeds were slower than the Sleep Inn in Beaufort. Overall, the amenities were reflective of a two star hotel.The management was incompetent, and they didn't have enough carts to load luggage when we checked out. I told them my complaints when I left, and at least they gave my family a complementary breakfast, which was decent but nothing special.You can get so much better for the money.  I received better at a Sleep Inn for half the price.First of all, the only good thing about this hotel is it's staff. They were extremely helpful and pleasant. Now for the rest of it. The tv guide didn't work. The channel selection is awful. You can't go out onto the balcony (even though that's part of the reason we booked the hotel). We bought the king bed with skyline view and got put on the 4th floor, so we had a great view of our parking lot. Unbelievable. Next, the rooftop bar that we were excited to see closed at midnight on a Friday! What bar closes at midnight on a Friday night? We had a rehearsal dinner that night and by the time we got back to the hotel, the bar and lounge was closed. I was woken up numerous times throughout the night by people slamming their doors shut, although even I couldn't close it without it slamming like that. Also, I wrote this review on the actual website and it doesn't show up, despite it being approved. How convenient. I'm telling you, for the price you pay for this hotel, stay somewhere else.Decided to take a break from work and plan a nice weekend getaway to Charleston. Upon Arrival it was clean and pleasant, Up the elevator and to the room. The room was nice, pretty spacious and had a great view ( had to pay extra for this ). First night was nice, went up to the restaurant up on the top level and it had amazing views, the Bartender Derek was quite nice and helpful, We ordered some food to take back to the room with us, and it took about 50-60 minutes for 2 meals and an appetizer. Was not impressed nor surprised that when we got to the room to eat, the food was cold. The next day the bathroom toilet over-flowed and flooded the bathroom floor and part of the carpeted area in front of the bathroom. They sent up maintenance and they seemed to had fixed it. since we were to be out for the entire day, they had a chance to get up the water, and leave a blower in the room to dry out the carpet. That evening, we were having more issues with the toilet, they sent the guy back up and he replaced all the inner workings of the tank. By morning, the water was still at the top of the toilet, close to overflow, so they brought us another set of room keys and had to move us to another room which thankfully had no issues for the remainder of the stay. The elevators were constantly having issues the whole time we were there, there were points where your only options were to wait your turn on the service elevator or take the stairs, considering our new room was on the 10th floor, it made the stairs not really an option. The free shuttle was an amenity that we did not take advantage of, but would have liked to. Trying to horde a bunch of people in a Van on a first come, first served basis every 2 hours was a bit much... people pushing their way to the front to get a spot. We ended up just driving ourselves.Other than that, the room was nice, the bed was comfortable, the cleaning staff came to our door the first morning and threw our towels and items on the bed, as the bathroom disaster was in the process of being cleaned up. She got frustrated when I could not give her the old towels, but considering they were in a wet pile on the bathroom floor, I was not going to grab them. Then she would not leave until I gave her a signature ( for what i'll never know as she did not tell me when I asked her why I had to sign ). We did have the breakfast buffet at the restaurant, and it was pretty good for the price. They did have a corporate manager on duty the evening when they were having all of the elevator issues and we were both given 1 free drink coupon for the bar upstairs. I also noticed at the end of the stay, on the bill, they had comped us $150 for all of the issues and problems. so, of a 4 night say, we got one night free. All in all, it was a decent place to stay, if you stayed out of the elevators and didn't flush the toilets.It was ok...kinda dated.  The lounge upstairs was nice.  Hung out there after a weddingIn comparison to the hotel which was very clean with a pleasant staff. The restaurant had terrible service and my seat was dirty with a sticky arm rest. I was extremely disappointed with the breakfast buffet. When the waitress brought the coffee the pot it was dirty and rusted with old dried coffee and food splatters. While we waited in line at the buffet the bus boy kept walking in front of us with his pan of dirty dishes instead of using the doors on either side to go the the kitchen. As for the food, the taste was fine but everything was cold. That included the congealed sausage gravy. In my opinion you'd do better with a stale donut from a vending machine.   My daughter tried to get breakfast at 6:30 which is the the time the buffet is supposed to be open. She was turned away and told to come back 15 minutes later. She had an important interview that morning so she was left to hunt for a snack someplace else.Although the weather was awful for the time of year, the Holiday Inn-Riverview shines on downtown Charleston from just over the river. I made my reservation directly with the property, hoping to insure a room with a nice view. I asked for a higher floor and was satisfied with being 8 stories up, Aside from the prime location, the cylinder shaped hi-rise is most impressive indoors as well as out. In a city where the number of hotels is not very high, it's most important to make a great impression at a competitive price. (I paid just under $150.00 per night). Having spent just three nights, we did not have time to take advantage of all the amenities. I base my review on the following: location, location , location, easy parking, cleanliness, noise level, friendly and helpful staff, and the overall appearance of this hotel are all 5-star! One could tell that the operators of the property are very image conscious and make everything as pleasing as possible for their guests. Stay there again? I definitely hope so.","The two stars are for the front desk staff and the view. They are both awesome! Otherwise, this hotel pretty much sucks big time. The air-con is loud and has an weird high pitched noise, pulling in and out of the hotel fells like a runner trying to cross the track at a nascar race, the walls are so thin that when someone enters their next-door room I jump because I think that someone is coming into my room, the first night the hot water was not hot, the second and third is was scalding, If you want a room with a view of the city then you will be right next to elevators that give a loud ""beep"" at every floor, the balconies are sealed permanently in all rooms, the pool is closed for the season, and the restaurant smells of BO. This is just off of the top of my head...On a side note however, they do have happy hour from 5-7 with really good food specials, but sadly the service in the BAR is AWEFUL so go at 5 and expect to leave around 7.Not sure why you would want to stay here, unless you got it on a great deal on Hotwire, which thank goodness, has eased the pain just slightly. Splurge and spend a bit more to stay somewhere else. You will not be sorry.This Holiday Inn delivers exactly the quality of service I've come to expect from this chain.  We found it to be clean, well-kept, and perfectly located for our purposes.  The view from the restaurant is very nice.  (Please note, I'm not rating the breakfast buffet here, which was okay, but I am focusing on the hotel on the whole.)  The only thing missing was an in-room refrigerator.  Service was friendly and fast.  And a fellow named Snyder even left us a note that he was able to perform some requested maintenance to the room.  (Which wasn't even a big deal, but we found the note to be very professional and courteous.)This is a standard 3-star hotel with some 4-star views. If you have the option to stay here for a low price, I say go for it. It truly is a-ok. The hotel is clean, service is good, rooms are fairly nice. It seemed to be very busy the weekend that I was in Charleston. The lobby is small - it is the type of hotel you would just go in and out of and not spend time in (but why would you want to anyway, with so much to do in Charleston?). There is a rooftop restaurant that overlooks the river and much of Charleston. The views are amazing! There are SOME hotel rooms with nice views too..although many do not. The good location of the hotel (off of the highway, a 5-7 minute drive to downtown with a complimentary hotel shuttle) and decent rates would lure me to stay here if it was an option on Priceline, Hotwire, or the likes. I probably would not coming running back on my own, though.We stayed here when the PGA was in Kiawah and it was good enough being one of the cheapest hotels still available, but I likely will not stay again unless under dire circumstances. Friendly staff, but small and dated rooms. Lounge bar on top floor does offer great views, but overall hotel is a little overpriced. Short drive or cab ride to downtown nightlife but I would just prefer to stay downtown instead if not much difference in price.Do you like feeling like you're sleeping in a 40-year old ashtray? Do you want to risk your life as you take a guess as to whether any traffic is coming when you try to pull out of the parking lot? Do you wish to sleep on a bed with linens that feel almost threadbare? If so, you're in luck and this Holiday Inn is the place for you!We had the ""fortune"" of Priceline booking us here for two nights for a recent weekend trip. Upon arrival in the early evening, the gentleman checking us in said Priceline had booked my husband and I in a two double bed smoking room. He was able to change us into a non-smoking room on the 10th floor with a lovely view...of the highway. Upon entering, it was clear the room had either once been a smoking room or the ventilation was pumping in a smoke scent for us to enjoy.Fine, whatever, we weren't planning on being in the room much anyway.That evening upon turning in, we discovered 1) the heating/cooling system in the room was one of the noisiest I have ever heard and 2) the sheets weren't going to do anything to keep us warm.The next morning, I decided to go for a jog towards the historic areas, which is across the bridge from the hotel. Be aware that the folks at the desk will tell you there is pedestrian access on one side of the bridge, but also be aware that the sidewalk ends on the more southern side of the bridge without a way for one to cross without taking a risk across the sidewalk.Leaving the parking area in one's car also puts one at risk, as there are plants that obscure the view of the coming traffic which is moving at approximately 50 mph, and I can only imagine how many accidents have occurred as a result of this.All in all, it was a room that was semi-convenient for our purposes for the weekend at a somewhat reasonable rate, but I think you can do far, far better when you are in Charleston with many other options.We stayed here for four nights in August 2009.  It's a circle-shaped hotel with a bar/restaurant on the top floor and a pool on a lower floor on the roof of an adjoining structure.  We picked this place because it was the highest Expedia star rating for the budget we were trying to stay in, and we liked that it seemed close to the historical area and some of the attractions we planned to see.  Overall, I was pleased with the stay in the hotel.  It's off of major thoroughfares but in our room on the sixth floor the street noise was negligible.  It was a nice dark room at night, and had killer a/c for when we'd come in from the humidity.  We kept it off most of the time because it had the ability to make the room overpoweringly cold, so I guess I should add that the rooms seemed cool and well ventilated as they were.Circle-shaped hotels have some inconveniences, and one is that your door is going to be right next to a neighbor's door.  For a few nights we could hear them come and go all day and night.  You could also sometimes hear the elevator ping as it passed floors, but I guess that says something for the general silence of the hallways, right?  I used the fitness room one night to run, and although the equipment was nice and there was a big plasma TV to stare at, one thing I hated was that the layout seemed to put everyone's backs to the entryway.  As a woman exercising alone it made me feel somewhat creeped out/vulnerable, but I also watch a lot of trashy crime/cop shows, so it puts that in my head.The funniest problem we ran into was that one night our door stopped locking, and we had to have maintenance come out and reprogram the electronic lock.  As it happened, our room was apparently unlocked for several hours while we were at a rehearsal dinner for our friends' wedding.  Our room contents were secure and untouched when we returned, so I guess you could say the place is safe at least!  Regardless, when they were alerted to the problem they were able to fix it quickly.  Props for that on a Saturday night!All in all it wasn't a bad place.  We'd consider staying there if we went to Charleston again, but wouldn't necessarily seek it out as THE place to stay.We drove to Charleston for a New Year's Eve change of scenery.  There was to be a party in the upstairs lounge for the festivities, and their concierge did his best to sell it, but we opted not.  The steps outside were littered with wannabe southern belles in short LBDs and 5-inch silver heels.The elevators have seen better days and have huge advertisement stickers on the doors that read, ""What's your sign?"" The shower was like something out of _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas._  See, it has a regular tub, but the curtain rod curves outward so that when you're done and you reach for the shower  curtain, it's still a foot away.  I think it's supposed to create the illusion of spaciousness, but instead left me with a minor twinge of vertigo-like discomfort.Other than that, it's pretty much what you'd expect--and they have HBO.For $89 on NYE, I'm not complaining.This hotel left much to be desired.  One of the elevators was already broken when we got there and the second one sounded like it was going to break down at any minute in our 4 day stay.  The rooms do not come with a standard small fridge or other basic amenities that other comparable hotels come with.  Don't let the small exterior balconies fool you, the doors to them are bolted shut in your room.  Also, no complementary standard Holiday Inn breakfast, and the coffee in the lobby stops at 9:30am sharp (what hotel does that?  Most have our all day).  This hotel left us underwhelmed in every way.  The restaurant in the hotel was terrible as well, overpriced and poor food quality.  We will not return to this hotel.Clean rooms, good location, quiet. No more than 20 min from anything and 5-10 min from any part of the downtown historic ditrict. The view from the rooftop bar is amazing.One of the best Holiday Inn's I have stayed at. Got upgraded to a suite and the room is great. Large room with a big sofa and 2 chase lounge chairs. The restraunt is great with a nice view. Will definately stay here again on my next visit to Charleston.",,,"['chaps', 'holiday', 'inn', 'well', 'situated', 'along', 'river', 'edge', 'downtown', 'location', 'makes', 'easy', 'downtown',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/elliott-house-inn-charleston,Elliott House Inn,4.0,$$,26,"This was really a nice bed and breakfast in downtown Charleston. Very good location. Across the street from the Mill House. Personally, I'm not a Bed and Breakfast girl, but this one was really nice. Such a great location. Close to all the cool downtown places..... Also Privacy!!!Our room was a little small but very cozy and clean. I wish I had brought my bathing suit to sit in the jacuzzi. The room had a small TV but we weren't watching TV anyway. We got to pick when they'd serve breakfast and it was Yummo. Id recommend the place for a night or two. Rooms were small but nice and clean. Friendly staff!  Also even though it's old,.... It's very pretty'. And so close to some of the most amazing restaurants in Charleston!!!Stayed here while on a trip to Charleston and couldn't have been more pleased. Elliott House is perfect if you need the basics while traveling: Clean room, comfy bed, clean bathroom, central location and excellent service. The location is one of the greatest things about Elliott House. Located right in the middle of town and close to all restaurants, tourist attractions, bars and shopping. If you're looking for convenience, this is an excellent choice. The rooms are a bit small, but aside from that, it provides a very cozy and relaxed place to stay. They also host a wine and cheese happy hour for all guests every day which is very laid back and relaxing. The front desk staff is also extremely polite and very quick to make great recommendations if you haven't been to Charleston before.As someone who was long skeptical of b&amp;b's, Elliot House really changed my whole mindset by providing a perfect experience. As a solo traveler on this trip, I couldn't have asked for anything else. Highly recommended.We came to Charleston during peek season (tourist and wedding) so all of the hotels were a bit pricy. I reserved a queen room for my boyfriends birthday, where we spent a Saturday and Sunday night.The hotel - I selected Elliott House because it wasn't quite a B&amp;B but had that feeling. Some of the B&amp;B's seem just a little bit too antiquated for me so I thought this would be a nice compromise, and I liked the cute courtyard. They do wine and cheese reception in the afternoon and complimentary breakfast which can be delivered to your room or to the courtyard. The wine and cheese reception and the complimentary breakfast were both nice touches but could have been better. The cheese are cubes of cheese you would get at the grocery store, and the wine tasted watered down. The breakfast options were only things like bagel, cereal, yogurt (no eggs and bacon here). They do have room service that they can deliver from 82 Queen, which we did not get to try. They recommend parking in the garage across the street but offer no validation or discount, which is a shame because it's $20 a day.The room - I spoke to one of the people at the front desk and they told me a little bit about the rooms. We selected the cheapest option which they said was on the street so it could be a little loud in the morning with delivery trucks. This was not a problem Sunday morning but it was very loud Monday morning when garbage got picked up. The room itself was very small, which was fine. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean and nice. There were scuff marks on the wall, but other than that the room was very nice and the turndown service was great.The location - this location was PERFECT. It's really in the action of Charleston with easy access to anywhere you want to go. Charleston isn't very large to begin with, but having this hotel in between King and Meeting street and on the south end of the peninsula worked out great.The staff - VERY nice. I was able to get a AAA discount for our hotel which dramatically reduced the price. I love that they will bring the breakfast straight to your room. We didn't really have any issues but I'm sure if we did they would have been very accommodating.This is an absolutely charming little bed and breakfast! It's the perfect place to stay for a true ""Charleston"" vacation, and it just so happens to be in an unbeatable location. Steps away from Elliot House, there is Queen 82, Poogan's Porch (a fabulous brunch and dinner spot), as well as the always talked-about Husk Restaurant (I went to all three- see reviews). You can also walk to the market, the pier, King Street and East Bay Street with complete ease.Onto the property itself- it's so quaint and lovely! They have a gorgeous courtyard where they serve complimentary wine and cheese from 5-7pm everyday with lush foliage, a gazebo and picturesque little nooks and crannies. The room I stayed in was very spacious with beautiful victorian decor throughout. It actually reminded me of my grandmother's southern home (who, by the way, has fabulous interior design taste!). The bathroom was extremely clean and rich with modern finishings. The only thing I would suggest that guests bring with them is a sleeping mask (our room never got totally dark due to the lighting from Husk and the courtyard out front, but then again, that probably had a lot to do with the location of our specific room). Housekeeping was always amazing, the bed was very comfortable and I have no complaints about my trip- just great memories!The last two things I would like to add is that the complimentary bike rentals were awesome (the bike rides were actually the highlight of my trip... you should try it!) and the customer service was phenomenal. When we arrived on the property, the nice young man working at the front office spent a good 10 minutes suggesting all sorts of good places to eat, visit and experience on our trip. He also handed us a printout of Charleston history and offered a few maps with some routes that he highlighted for us to enjoy. Overall, I could not have asked for a more accommodating, friendly-staffed and equally charming bed &amp; breakfast to stay at while on vacation. If you want to enjoy a small, lovely bed &amp; breakfast that treats you like family, then Elliot House is definitely your spot! I will most certainly stay here again when I return. :)Clean and private rooms that look to have been recently renovated.  Very comfortable and relaxing.  It's a good mix of a hotel and B&amp;B.  The staff are extremely friendly and they offer a wine and cheese hour every evening.  The continental breakfast is served to your room or to a table in their courtyard.  I highly recommend this business and will be back in the future.  Unfortunately, there is no street parking due to the historic aspect of where this is located but their is a parking garage directly across the street that's $20/day.Where to start.... Let's see, the site we booked the hotel on had a 100% positive feedback.. We love charleston, been many times, always wanted to stay here but pricey. So ended up booking it on a whim and showing up the same day. The outside pergola was dirty, the ""pool"" which was the size of a king size bed.. Speaking of the beds, in the room the size are twin beds. Not good for two adults..     Anyway walked into a very pleasant guy at front desk. Went into the room and first thing we saw were dead cockroaches on the bathroom floor. For 300$ a night ""off season"" what a joke.. So many fun and beautiful places to stay in charleston, skip this one!     Oh yeah!!!! A little advice to the women cleaning the rooms and delivering breakfast. You work in customer service, wouldn't kill you to smile and say good morning back to a guest!We're staying at the Elliott House for the second time now.  The place is clean and the location is very convenient between one of our favorite restaurants (Poogans Porch) and a nice little French wine bar ( Bin 152).  The rooms are fairly spacious for the price you pay per night.  Try to avoid rooms 10 and 21 as they are facing Queen St unless you want to use the garbage trucks as your personal alarm clock.  This is a common challenge with many hotels in Charleston but it seems even more noisy in those rooms.  The breakfast is good, I especially like the classy touch of ceramic coffee cups and silver coffee pots.  It reminds me of the ""old-timey"" breakfasts you're served in Europe.  We will try some other hotels the next few times we're back in Charleston but the Elliott House is definitely a very solid alternative if you're looking for an above average stay between Market and the Battery.My wife and I loved staying at the Elliott House Inn for a few days during our recent trip to Charleston. The people are very friendly, the location is very convenient (parking garage across the street and walking distance to everything in the city), and the rooms were very nice and clean. The price was also very affordable.**Helpful Hint: Free breakfast and daily wine happy hours are included with your stay. Even if you want to get out of the Inn for either event, it is great to have the option.The guy at the desk was extremely nice &amp; helpful. I would suggest to get a room in the back Bc of all the noise. Rooms are quite small.Honestly the ""breakfast"" was no good. They should just offer coffee. Wine &amp; cheese was cheap. They should just do away with that as well. We had a comfortable king size bed. The location is amazing though. Would probably not go back.Elliott House has a lot to recommend it. At the top of the list is location - so many excellent restaurants within two blocks. The staff is friendly and efficient. The rooms are large and comfortable. The 5 PM wine and cheese in the courtyard is pleasant, even if the actual wine and cheese is indifferent. However, you have to understand that Charleston is a city were all maintenance is deferred and casual scruff is part of the charm. If you are expecting the sleek spotlessness of a spanking new property you will not only be disappointed, you will be horrified. There some people I would never recommend this to and others I would highly recommend stay here. I think you two camps know who you are.My husband and I were in town for just one night &amp; we had a great time here! I love to stay in historic B&amp;B's &amp; this one was unique, charming, &amp; beautiful in it's own way. We parked our car across the street in the parking garage ($20 for overnight, but we didn't mind) &amp; walked everywhere we went. The room was quaint &amp; comfy &amp; the bed was cozy. We enjoyed the free wine &amp; cheese reception that they serve at 5pm every day. Our favorite part was the breakfast they brought to our room the next morning. It was so nice to have breakfast in bed! Not a whole lot of food, but we enjoyed what they served &amp; it was enough to fill us up until lunch. The people were nice &amp; very helpful. Will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Charleston!Another great location. Parking garage across the street (paid). The property is small but has a great lay out including a swimming pool. My room was small I suppose in that the king size bed took up almost all of it. The decor was a solid balance of historic southern and modern convenience. I thought the bathroom was fantastic. I enjoyed the custom breakfast delivery in the morning and the inviting lobby in the afternoon. The staff are really nice and extremely knowledgeable. You're also walking distance to pretty much everything you need to or want to see on the peninsula. Best of all you are near some of the best restaurants serving some of the best food in South Carolina if not the entire Southeast. If you're in to history ask for the guy that happens to be a historian and also works here. He knew  everything about everything. He printed out his summaries and suggestions based on our conversations from his personal notes. Those few pages ended up being a great resource.Excellent location, but that's about it.  The rooms are small with rather basic amenities for the price. The breakfast should be termed ""why bother"". In a town noted for its food, Costco muffins and cold cereal do not cut it. The only fruit was half a grapefruit that was not sectioned with the sharpest utensil a butter knife. At least the coffee was good. The wine and cheese in the afternoon was also uninspired. Pleasant desk staff.My favorite historic bed &amp; breakfast in Charleston.  Staff is impeccable, rooms are beautiful.  I always recommend these  accommodations when staying in Charleston.I spent 2 nights at the Elliot House Inn.  You can't beat the location, you can walk to many shops/restaurants/attractions.   Bikes are offered for you to explore the city on your own.  Another plus, the evening wine/cheese reception.  Clean rooms and helpful staff. The breakfast was just enough food to begin your day.  My next trip to charleston will include another stay here.Price wasn't bad, considering ALL of Charleston is expensive.  In hind-sight we shoulda done a <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FVRBO.com&amp;s=dc89a0f9c902602582311664aed1a3ba88a111619812076106a03f8fc8ab5c6d"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">VRBO.com</a> rental.  We rented two rooms...one king for ourselves, and one queen fo our parents.  Room #28 was the king suite, and it was fantastic. Beautiful decor, built in cabinets, nice TV, and a couch.  Room #25 was the queen suite, and it was disappointing.  There was a sewer pipe running the length of the ceiling, hardly any decor, smelled like mold and the window-view was a plaster wall of the restaurant next door, less than 3 feet away. One morning a cockroach (Palmetto bug as they call it) ran across the floor.The nice girl at the front desk let me see room 11 as a possible alternative, but it was just as bad.  Later, i voiced my displeasure to the GM, and she refunded a nice portion of the rental, so i have to give them credit for that. She told me each room is individually owned and decorated, and that Elliott House simply serves as the on-site management.  Fair enough, but i think they should set a certain standard for room decor...and definitely get rid of the moldy smell.Also, you had to ask for an iron (which leaked water like a sieve), and ironing board (which was damn-near broken).  The breakfast is typical continental, but at least they deliver it to your room.Adorable little B&amp;B in downtown Charleston. The staff was very accommodating and the room was very charming. I will definitely be staying here again. There is an outdoor Jacuzzi and they bring breakfast and coffee to your room in the morning. It's also located right downtown near a ton of amazing James Beard nominated/awarded restaurants. A sweet little gem.We stayed for 3 nights in February and loved it. The only thing that we thought that they could improve on was breakfast. You only get a couple of choices and it's the same choices every day.. When I say ""a few choices"" I mean yogurt and muffin or beagle and half of a grapefruit.. I was starving by 9am. Other than that everything was perfect, walking distance to everything.Stayed here for the first time for five days immediately before Christmas so we were there long enough to get a good feel for the physical comforts of the place as well as the service.  On both counts it deserves solid marks.  Rooms are adequate and comfortable and we found the staff prepared to go above and beyond what is called for to see that your stay is enjoyable.  Location is the most compelling factor as it is within a short to reasonable walk of all of Charleston's downtown attractions and districts.  In a word it is convenient to anywhere you would want to eat, shop, or visit.  Municipal parking right across the street adds to the convenience if you have a car.  Parking at $22 a day is also reasonable given the location.  Breakfasts were light which was great for us as we spent the rest of our time in town eating our way through all of Charleston's excellent restaurants.  Wine and cheese at night was a nice way to close out the day if we were around that time in the late afternoon or early evening.  The secret of the Elliott House however is the pool/jacuzzi which seems to draw criticism from some reviewers.  After a long day on your feet walking to all of the attractions near the Elliott House a relaxing session in the hot waters of the jacuzzi with the water jets going is all you need to fully relax and get your feet and legs ready to do it all again the next day.  The courtyard is also a quiet and peaceful place to unwind and relax between walking trips around town.  Finally, the Elliott House is an inn/BandB and does not pretend to offer all the things that a full service hotel makes available.  As such, the rooms and the TVs are not huge and many of the things a seasoned traveler expects to find in a full service hotel are not in the room.  However, as an inn/BandB it is more than adequate and deserves all four of the stars we gave it in this rating.My GF and I booked two nights at the Elliot House.  The location is ideal for a Charleston getaway.  This gem of an Inn is located within walking distance of almost everything (restaurants, museum s, shopping, etc.).  Upon arrival you will be greeted by either Grace or Neil both local Charleston folk with a touch of southern hospitality.  Grace was an absolute sweet heart and very helpful with all our accommodations, while Neil was a history buff and provide great insight of what to see and do, he provided a useful map and essay he wrote about Charleston.  The overall hotel was very clean and well maintained with a picturesque scene.  The breakfast was wonderful they would deliver it to your room at any time you desired.  Overall the only issue I had was you had to pay 20$ a day for parking which is a parking garage across the street, to me this should just be included in the price of the hotel.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a Charleston getaway.","This place is truly a hidden gem in Charleston! Was in town for a wedding and we needed a hotel for Thursday-Sunday but Mills House Hotel (where the block of rooms was) only had Friday-Sunday available. Although Mills House was nice, I would have much preferred all 3 nights at Elliott House Inn if I had known how amazing their rooms and amenities were.A LOT of thought has been put into all upgrades in the rooms.  The bathrooms have top of the line fixturing, the linens are crisp and white, and the room was quaint and clean.  You even have a small private patio!This isn't even touching upon the warm pastries, yogurt, coffee carafe, and juice delivered to your room on a silver tray in the morning.  And that is in addition to the wine and cheese nightly happy hour in the courtyard.Aside from being next to the neighboring restaurant, housekeeping is a little noisy in the morning.  But, this is something I have come to look past as it happens in every hotel that I stay in no matter where I travel.  I cannot wait to make another trip to Charleston and stay here again.  Will definitely recommend to all of my friends and family.My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary at the end of April.  It was the only bed and breakfast type inn we could find with any availability one month before our trip.  It was really nice that they have a 24 hour concierge, so someone was there to greet us after our late arrival Thursday night.  The courtyard is quite pretty, as well as the rest of the exterior of the inn.  The biggest issue we had with Elliott House was the breakfast.  It is nice that they bring it to you on a tray in the morning, but you only get to choose from cereal, bagel, Activia yogurt and granola.  I feel like the amount you pay for the hotel should yield a nicer selection of breakfast items.  I really would rather that they save the trouble of delivering breakfast and just have a really nice hot continental breakfast.  The first morning we ordered the bagels with cream cheese and received no cream cheese. The third morning we ordered tea and coffee, and received hot water with no tea.  Definitely not an issue to totally ruin our experience, but definitely an annoyance.  Other than a few minor issues, the inn was pleasant.  The room was nice and comfortable.  The location was also very convenient, directly next door to two restaurants, one being the very highly acclaimed Husk (where we did dine and had a great experience)We absolutely enjoyed our stay at the Elliott House.  Can't say enough good stuff about the staff... everyone we encountered was exceptional.  The Inn is everything we hoped it would be... quaint, cozy, perfectly located.  Although we didn't have the opportunity to partake of the wine &amp; cheese reception, it was nice to know it was available.  We had read the reviews re: noise from the adjoining restaurants and early morning deliveries... we experienced none of that.  Of course, our room was at the back of the property overlooking the courtyard.  We also read of the musty smelling rooms... It's Charleston!  It's humid!  ;-)  Room delivery on the continental breakfast is a nice touch!  Yes, it's a very basic offering, but it is sufficient.  You want more than that?  Walk a couple blocks over to Toast.  My only recommendation for the Inn would be to power wash the stairwells a little more often.  They were looking a little rough.  Want the rest of my wish list?  Adding a full length mirror to the rooms would be helpful, and an in-room mini fridge would be awesome!Spent a night at  this little gem, located between Meeting and King St. We were a day early meeting up with family and booked a room for the same day. The staff was very friendly and personable. The room was charming, comfortable and super clean, with a great hot shower (not always the case with historic setting). A nice continental breakfast is included (served either in room or courtyard), and the free beach cruisers were an excellent way to tour the beautiful surroundings and historic homes. Definitely worth a repeat visit when in Charleston again!If you like to be awakened EVERY morning at 6:30 by the garbage truck, you will enjoy this place. If you enjoy the sound of a pressure washer 15 feet away in the courtyard while you are eating a minimal breakfast at 8:30 in the morning, you will adore this place. The rooms are ok, nothing special. It is convenient to all the shops and restaurants in Charleston, but the ambiance is below average.I had to stay for business, so my visit was quick and didn't have the luxury to enjoy the outdoor courtyard for daily wine and cheese. It's located in the heart of downtown Charleston within walking distance to shops, restaurants and sight seeing.  The parking isn't convenient as it is across the street in a public parking deck, but the Inn Staff suggested I pull into their small driveway to drop off my suitcase before parking.  The overnight parking costed about $20.  The room itself was nice and quaint although my upstairs neighbors had their TV a bit loud until late at night.  However, the A/C system was so loud it drowned out any outside noise. It had a nice back patio that might be enjoyable with room service.  I didn't care too much for the cheap quaility of linens especially the bath towels. I prefer a more plush bath towel with washcloths and bath mat which was missing.  The cute little danish, yogurt and tea was a nice touch in the morning delivered to your room at your designated time. The courtyard had a cute little pool that was more for the visual than for swimming since it was full of leaves and not warm enough to swim. I don't know if I will stay again as if I'm going to stay in an Inn or Bed &amp; Breakfast I would rather explore other options in Charleston.",,,,"['really', 'nice', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'downtown',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/meeting-street-inn-charleston,Meeting Street Inn,4.0,$$,25,"We arrived here as hurricane Joaquin was beginning to ease up. We couldn't have made it into town if it weren't for a Uber driver that knew the back streets. When we arrived we needed a drink and since nothing was opened they brought a carafe of wine, pimiento cheese spread, crackers and fruit. Each morning is a free breakfast that is much better than you see at other hotels. In the evening is a wine and hors d'oeuvres. The hotel is in a great location and our room had a balcony. We were very happy with our decision to stay here once the weather got better. I would recommend this hotelWhen I stayed in Charleston I wanted quaint. A stay with a place with four poster beds, in the historic district, in an old building. Well I got it. Not sure if it was a good choice in the Meeting Street Inn however. I think it might stem from the disconnect between $180 a night and the level of appointments that I received. Now don't get me wrong, the staff was friendly and the exterior of the place was equally pretty. They had a nice courtyard and architecture that was very fitting with the rest of the area. I got my 4 post bed (that was very comfy), but there were some downsides. First off - the breakfast was really bad. The food was just....inedible. Perhaps my first morning they were off but I wasn't about to try it again. Rock-hard boiled eggs, stale muffins and this casserole...thing. Secondly - the wifi was uselessly bad. I was on the 4th floor towards the back so I guess their existing infrastructure didn't reach that far back. It's 2016 guys - I need wifi to work, not just play. The room itself was definitely old and worn, but it was clean. Very small, kinda dirty porch out the back. Housekeeping was very friendly. Can't say I would come back but I am not their target demographic - I am sure they will be fine.I came here with my daughter on a last minute get away, and as she said to me, ""This place alone makes me want to come back.""  I have been to the Charleston area many times, and though the weather this time was not friendly, the staff here certainly was, and we felt at home here immediately.  The value was very good...great breakfast included (loved the ham and Brie sandwiches), afternoon wine  and cheese (the pimento cheese was excellent); but most of all, the staff felt like friends after just a few days.  People always make the experience what it is after all.  Darren and Neeko (I'm sorry if that's not spelled right) not only put upwith our craziness from the beginning, but were just genuinely cool people with good taste in music, actors, comedians, and the latest in scarf/ascot trends. Even out of the ring...you guys rock.  Every person on staff here was extremely warm and helpful.  The Inn is quaint, with so much history, and perfectly located.  It has been a pleasure.The BEST, MOST ACCOMODATING, WONDERFUL people you will meet in Charleston! We had booked at another hotel that turned out to be incredible unsatisfactory. Fortunately, we were able to find The Meeting Street Inn. We were greeted by Keith and Darren (aka ""Broadway"") who were wonderful at making sure we were comfortable and having a delightful stay.  They allowed us to go up and view the room first, worked out our reservation so we did not have to change rooms for the following night since we were a last minute walk in, had a bellhop for bags and someone to valet the car since parking was about 2 blocks away. Keith was able to help us book a few different tours and Darren was always there to help with any questions or recommendations of places in the city - in general good-hearted people who care about the travelers in their hotel - great people to know and a splendid staff.The hotel itself is unbelievably charming, a true feel of southern hospitality - just look at the pictures!The stay included daily HOT breakfast buffet AND a cocktail hour with free wine, cheese and crackers : ) It is also conveniently located to everything - Kings Street Shopping, Market Place, East Blvd. - plus Toast is right next door!Best tip about this place: they have huge, fluffy, clean and comfortable towels - pool side and in your room!We love this place and the staff!  Betty, Jo, Lee, Lorenzo, and January--by the time we left they felt like friends.  Terrific food.  Relaxing. Close to everything we wanted to do in charleston.  Wonderful roomNice older hotel with charming decor. If you want something a little out of the ordinary with old city charm this is it!!! The staff was so polite and extremely helpful.... Looking forward to our next stay.This place is awesome!! I was here for work and stayed 3 nights at Charleston Place for a convention and then we switched to The Meeting Street Inn because my family also came with me and we wanted a real Charleston experience. The staff here is amazing, super friendly. Wine and cheese is served at 5 every evening. There is a van that can take you anywhere you want to go which was nice because it rained a lot the week we were here. And the breakfast has everything you can imagine. Would stay here again for sure! Plus the location is right in the middle of everything. Love the homey feel!We stayed for 1 night at this hotel last month. I was looking for a reasonably-priced place with some southern charm, and this was it! The location is great - within walking distance of many restaurants, shops, and the waterfront. The breakfast buffet was the best I have ever seen or tasted. The wine &amp; cheese hour was delightful. The room was clean, and the decor was charming, along with a wonderful courtyard area. My only complaint is that they do not have a pool. They have a very small hot tub in the courtyard, which nobody wanted to use in the 100+ degree temps in July. I would recommend The Meeting Street Inn to anyone!We  were so pleased with our stay.  I am very fussy about cleanliness and this inn lived up to my standards.  The breakfast was varied and good; the afternoon wine with the cheese and fruit platter was fresh and plentiful and afternoon lemonade with homemade cookies hit the spot.  The staff is courteous and helpful.  Located in the heart of the city enabled us to walk to all our destinations throughout the weekend.  I can't wait to come back for another visit!It is cheap for a reason! Wait, did I say ""cheap?"" Cause our two-night stay there ran us about $400 (including parking and taxes). No I don't think it is cheap at all, and I would rather spend a little more and stayed at a better B&amp;B.Now let me be clear about the positives: The people working there were very nice and helpful and the room was clean. It is also in a prime location, but you know what? Pretty much all Inns and hotels in the historic center are in prime location as everything is in walking distance.Now for the negatives that were however not deal-breakers, just good mood breakers: 1.The parking situation is not ideal. Their parking garage for which we were charged an extra $14/night, is two blocks away (did we know that? no). They do have golf carts that transport as back and forth and the drivers are very nice. However, our second day there we came back from the beach to find to open spot in that lot. Really? If you charge people, you better do the math and leave their spots available for the total of their stay. It seemed that this happens quite often, judging from the staff reaction when we told them. By the time we went to the hotel, and the golf cart guy followed us back (to resolve the situation another car was leaving). Point is, this should not have happened.2. Yes the breakfast sucks but I don't care that much. We are staying in a foodie town, so I don't have to rely on their breakfast or their ""wine and cheese"" reception we chose not to attend (went to a wine bar instead). But at one point their water dispenser carafe broke (again from what I was told), so there was no water. Next morning they ran out of forks (!). There was no seating available in our outside during breakfast.3. The bathroom was clean, counter large, but bathtub way outdated. No nice cutie bathroom lotions/no hair conditioner. AC was loud. TV was small. No pen in the room. Room felt stuffy after a day. People, you can't just add a canopy bed and some flower wallpaper and call this charming OK?Dealbreakers:1. Slotted 4rth floor  ""balcony""; No a/c in the elevator: it was like a sauna in there; did not know which evil to go for, the elevator or the stairs and received all the heat from the a/c motors next to them.2. Most important: the overall ""feel"" of this place. Basically it is a half step-upped and overpriced Days Inn (which is next door AND has its own parking lot). That is not what I have in mind when I reserve a room in a B&amp;B in Charleston, and when I pay all this money, sorry.The hotel is very historic and gives you a glimpse into the way life used to be. The room was clean and adequate. What you really pay for is the historic southern charm and location. The location was just about perfect. I don't have children but I would say this is not a family friendly hotel. There is an oversized hot tub in the small courtyard but that's it for entertainment. The old lobby has antique furniture and they offer complimentary breakfast and happy hour alcohol drinks. Plenty of Southern charm and flare but don't expect much luxury. I would stay there again but I don't feel an obligation of loyalty.Bkfst a disappointment.  I thought this was a B &amp; B so I arranged my morning sched to be sure to have time to enjoy a gourmet bkfst.  Alas, it was the usual fare you'd get on the interstate; small boxes of cereal, styrofoam bowls, eggs made hours or days in advance, etc.  Quite a letdown.Staff not too friendly, either.  Barely looked up when I entered the room and this happened each time.For the price this place was great!! The staff was very helpful and the rooms were very charming.  Darren Whitaker was the gentleman that helped us and we were very impressed with the service we got while we were here.  Nice centrally located place.Very charming hotel. They actually use real keys. It was very charming and neat. The front desk owners/ employees were too busy to get up and acknowledge me or anyone else that was standing at the front desk.   They were very put out. Definitely when they get to you mentality.  Very poor service for 220 a night. Won't go back!We were in Charleston for a wedding and stayed here for the cheaper option. The location is killer the rooms are completely solid. Free WI-FI is always great. I breakfast exceeded my expectations, though I should note they were not high. Parking was super simple across the street. Staff was average. Not horrible at all but nothing that was all that great either. 3 stars for room and staff. Extra star for cost and location.No complaints here! Super close to King Street, adorable and cozy rooms with canopy beds and even a little balcony, (super) friendly staff, and a fine continental breakfast. There's even a jacuzzi, and outside there is a nice space to sit and relax. You can either find street parking or park across the street ($12 a night).  The price was reasonable, especially for a holiday weekend (about $129). Great old-style charm!checked into the hotel last night. I didn""t realize until today when i got a pop-up from my credit card company that they had over-charged us biig-time. we were quoted $159/night and we were charged something quite different when I did the math it came out to  about $240/night (including tax). Charleston has a  13% hotel  tax  so it looks like an overcharge of about $80/night --ouch! We went to the front desk and were told that we were charged the high season rate which begin tonite  and we need to talk to the manager--he comes in later.  we shall se how that goes.All in all, after staying at The Mansion on Forsyth Park in Savannah it's hard to say anything great about this hotel--rather run-down and in need of a facelift. a little cleaning all around wouldn't hurt either.I will follow up with another review when we depart.Great place to stay! Rooms are very pretty and a perfect location in the historic district.I loved staying at this inn. We were on vacation in Savannah and Charleston and made the decision to just find historic inns in the center of town so we could walk everywhere. Not all historic inns are this nice and cozy, and clean. But this was very well maintained, A lot of antique charm and cool side porches that lead to your room. The bed was comfortable and had a canopy. There was a nice outdoor patio for having your morning coffee before heading out around town. Just a unique experience. And the price was reasonable for the location.Good old Charleston aesthetic,If one is going to stay in Charleston, it is great not to stay in a modern room. The Inn was old, yet smelled nice, much better then the modern rooms we stayed in down the coast :-) The wooden walkways and stairs creaked, the wall paper and lamps were ghastly and appropriate. The furniture was comfortable dark leather chairs and dark old fashioned dressers to hide the TV. Central to why I wrote this review was the beds :-D, tall four poster beds with the crochet netting. You know in all those movies where people hid under the bed, and no one can fit under a modern bed at all, so I makes you wonder where these beds are that anyone could hide under. Well 3 or 4 people could comfortably hide under these giant old bed frames. We laughed when we opened the door to our room, we thought it was so quaint and neat'O and oh yeah romantic. A plus, they have cheese and crackers and wine at 5:30 pm and nice sweet bread goodies, bagels, fruit and coffee etc .. from 7 to 10ish am. And of course it is walking distance to the waterfront, and all the old shops, and everywhere one wanders while visiting the lovely old town of Charleston.P.s. I'm not sure why I didn't give them 5 stars. Then even had good WiFi, and I think they might have a ghost or two.","A very quaint hotel.  After checking out the Miller Hotel down the block and comparing rooms I decided to stay at the Meting.  The Miller's room smelled liked cooking grease and the beds were like cardboard, and they wanted $200+.  The Meeting is a huge mom and pop hotel.  You're surrounded by antique charm the moment you hit the lobby.  The staff is pleasant and easy to deal with. My room was a nice size, very clean with no deodorant odor and came with a queen.  The queen mattress was a bit high off the floor..  it reminded me of when I was a kid and I used to take running starts, jump and do a rolling tumble on my parent's bed because it was so high off the floor.  But the mattress felt comfortable and I fell asleep easily so the height size was more amusing than it was a pain.  Television was adequate.  No electric outlet was supplied by my desk and I had to work my laptop wireless (supplied on the house) on my bed.  I attended the nightly wine and cheese party the staff throws at 5:30 p.m. and it's quite nice.  You socialize with other guests, drink wine and eat some mediocre tuna spread and spicy mushroom, which really isn't important since the food is just a pretext to relax, or relax and chat.  I even met a couple from Park Slope who were with their family from Knoxville and Birmingham.  Continental breakfast is also on the hotel.  There's a parking lot across the street that charges $12 a day for hotel guests and you're situated right in the middle of the historic district.My only complaints, which might be moot because of certain circumstances is that their ac/heater only does cool, cold and very hot.  I was there during the cold snap which I understand is a rare occurrence and had it on very hot.  Also, you're given a key to your room, not a smart card.  A key that fits into a hall and closet lock on the front door.  A lock someone like me can easily card open.  However, I am a native Brooklyn and am therefore naturally.I will go back again later this year when it gets warmer.Phenomenal location and a wonderful, generous staff that went out of its way to be helpful at every turn. The folks at the front desk made great recommendations, helped us sort out car rental confusion and then a mistaken parking ticket among other things, and were easy-going and friendly throughout. Accommodations were spacious and while there was limited natural light as noted by other reviewers there were plenty of lamps and a private back porch so we could leave the door open when desired. It was perfect for our needs and we would return the Inn in a heartbeat on future Charleston travels.I took a trip to Charleston with my family recently and stayed at the Meeting Street Inn.  A friend had recommended it and I am sure glad she did.  It was really quaint and in a great location.  There was so much to see around the Inn.  I would recommend it to anyone who is going to Charleston.If you're staying in Charleston, this is a great place to spend your money.The hotel is not cheap, but it has a lot of advantages. One caveat though: this hotel is not new, and it shows. If you're looking for a polished high-class experience then go somewhere else. That's not what Charleston is about though, this hotel has some charm.It's centrally located, just south of the City Market and it comes with parking across the street. They serve wine and cheese in the evenings as well as  pastries in the mornings.cute little inn with more character than one of those big chain-hotels. and by character, i don't mean nastiness - the room we stayed in was very clean and relatively spacious. great location as it is walking distance to all the main tourist sights of downtown charleston. wine and cheese reception daily. they also have breakfast in the morning but we didn't get up in time for that, since we were still on pacific time. oh and free wifi!",,,,"['arrived', 'hurricane', 'beginning', 'ease', 'made', 'town', 'driver',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-restoration-on-king-charleston,The Restoration on King,5.0,$$$,27,"We typically stay at mid-range hotels when we travel but this hotel was the one of choice for our daughter's wedding.We felt like royalty.  Service and the people were amazing, courteous, friendly and anything you needed they were glad to do so.Rooms were spacious and clean and had many amenities.  Yes we did perhaps pay for them but was so nice to experience.Each afternoon is a wine and cheese hour, breakfast included and delivered each morningWe will definitely come back to here when visitingYou can walk to many shops, restaurants and sitesStopped in for a drink and a bite to eat while in town on business...ended up meeting there Food and Bev manager Rob who really made us feel at home. Will most definitely be staying and dining here anytime were in Charleston. Incredible food, remarkable hospitality and a rooftop. Thanks again Rob.Best rooftop sunset views in the city. Full bar and restaurant with two separate outside padios. Nice unique place that is still undiscovered by the tourists let along the locals to bring friends or a date.The Good:-Location- Great location, with an entrance right off of King Street--dining, shopping, and sites are all close by, along with the College of Charleston's campus. -The Room- As others have said, the rooms are more like condos. They are huge! I thought I booked a standard room, but I got a living room connected to a full kitchen. There were utensils, pots and pans, and other kitchen items to use. It would certainly be possible to cook a simple meal. -The Treats: Wine and cheese in the evening and cookies and milk before bed--what could be better?! Maybe a specialized breakfast picnic basket delivered to your room.....? Well they have that too! You can choose from a variety of pastries, cereals, and bagels, and drinks.The Bad:-The Rooftop Terrace- So disappointing! The lounge chairs are nice, but it greatly lacks the essential rooftop amenity--views! All you can see is roofing -The Housekeeping- While the complimentary treats are nice, Restoration could up their game when it comes to details. For example, under the bathroom sink, there was a tissue left behind (Ew). Also, when I opened the vanity kit that usually includes cotton balls and q-tips, it was empty. It wasn't a huge deal, but it made me wonder what else they forgot to do. The In-Between:-The Service - It was either terrific or horrible. During the day there was a young woman who lacked the hospitality that one needs to work at the front desk of a hotel. She answered questions if prompted, but was not very helpful. For example, when the printer she said guests were welcome to use ran out of ink, she did not offer a solution. However, when I asked another front desk member that night, he was able to print from a different location. This leads me to the opposite end of their service spectrum; the second person at the front desk was extremely friendly, as was the man who showed me to my room and turn-down service.  4 stars because the good parts were so good. The bad parts were disappointing, but not total deal breakers.They turned this condo complex into a hotel so your room are huge! The prices was on the lower end and breakfast served to your room each morning was great. The staff on hand was very knowledgeable and the location was right in the middle of everything you want.Absolutely loved this place!  Spacious, clean, private patio, full bath &amp; half, full kitchen (stocked with both tap &amp; sparking water, and soda), living room, and dining area.  Evening wine &amp; cheese, cookies at 9:00 pm, and the best thing ever, your breakfast basket waiting for you in the morning outside your door!  Staff was friendly, laid back, and helpful; everything you would expect in Charleston.Incredible place to stay in Charleston! Absolutely worth the splurge! The rooms are gorgeous with exposed brick, modern appliances, and plush furniture. The whole place was more like an apartment than a hotel room. The bathroom felt like a spa. The bed was huge and comfy, There were two flat screen TVs with tons of channels. The kitchen was fully stocked with silverware, plates, glasses, servingware, etc. The wifi was free and fast. Service staff were friendly and accommodating. Charleston is a beautiful city worth visiting and you absolutely should stay at ROK - unfortunately it is hard to leave the room once you are there, it's that perfect.- these guys are first class - best hotel experience I've ever had- the staff bends over backwards and goes way above and beyond to ensure each guest's needs are met (and exceeded)- each room is unlike any hotel you've ever seen; there's definitely more of a ""condo"" feel to the rooms...ridiculously well decorated. very comfortable furniture - the location is perfect. walkable to anywhere on king, down to east bay, over to the market...central location. right in the middle of where you want to be - despite the busy location, they have expertly laid out the formation of each condo to feel very private and secluded. you're not able to look out your window and see anyone else's room...even on your deck (yes, several of the rooms have large decks fully furnished with outdoor furniture), you feel like you're in your backyard, or in the seclusion of your private high rise - I can't emphasize how great the staff is...you'll really have to see it and experience it to believe it. the amenities are essentially limitless. free breakfast delivered to your door each morning, along with the paper. ipads and apple tv's available to be set up and delivered to your room (no charge), bikes (think beach cruiser, with a basket in front) are available to borrow on the house and they even have milk and cookies on a nightly basis...after their wind and cheese offerings feet evening...unbelievable! you can't beat this place - this place is constantly sold out...it's s definite boutique experience. there are only 16 rooms as of Feb. 2015, but they're currently undergoing some major expansion, including an in-house spa (!!!)- I can't wait to stay here on my next trip to charleston. once you stay here, it's tough to imagine staying anywhere else!I love this place. So gorgeous!! The staff was so helpful. Someone at the front desk walked us to our room and before we got off the elevator he had planned out out whole night with a slew of bars and restaurant recommendations and scenic walks to take there. He knew what vibe and crowd we were looking for and mapped it all out for us. I couldn't believe how cute the picnic basket of breakfast was. It was delivered right to our door. Perfect downtown location.  Amazing rooftop and beautiful and modern designed rooms that include a large kitchen and living room.My husband and I had a great stay here. The rooms were huge and very comfortable. Great customer service. We were going to the beach and they provided us with beach chairs and beach towels. They really go above and beyond to make sure your stay is comfortable and easy. We will be back!Wow. What a perfect place to stay while visiting Charleston, SC. We parked our car and forgot about it for the whole weekend. The four of us shared a two bed/ two bath room with a massive kitchen/ dining area. I wish my house were this nice! It felt like we were staying in an upscale condo. The windows had wrap around views of King Street. I can't get over how accomodating this place was. It's like they thought of everything. A few of my favorite things: breakfast delievered every morning in a picnic basket to your room, nice bathroom amenities, nice dishes for use in the kitchen, happy hour for guests (wine, cheese &amp; beer) each night from 5-6, and a beautiful rooftop open to guests. I would love to stay here again sometime! The front desk attendant was very helpful with recommending places to go and things to do during our stay.This is the only place I will stay when in Charleston.  We have stayed here so many times and every stay is always great.  I consider the amazing staff and management first class all the way! I wish I lived here.Beautiful hotel smack in the middle of Charleston.Palmetto Bluff was a tough act to follow.  But, the Restoration on King delivered and then some.  It's right on the corner of King and Wentworth, steps away from all of the action and the best shopping in town.  Arriving early in the day, our suite wasn't ready.  They checked our bags for us and took our car.  After a quick lunch and a bit of sightseeing, we were all set.  And let me tell you, we were set.  We were greeted by Howard, the GM, who welcomed us and gave us some advice about town.  He mentioned the lobby wine ad cheese hour and how they had free iPads for guest use.  How cool is that?  Grabbed one of those right then and there, and tinkered with it our whole stay.  This loft conversion building looks as if it were intended to be condos.  We had a huge suite with more room than we really needed and amenities and touches we weren't expecting to have.  Our multilevel room included hardwood floors, a full kitchen with stainless appliances, W&amp;D, living room, plasmas, ceiling fans, sound machine and even an outdoor patio.  The king bed was super comfy and we slept like babies to the sound of crashing waves from the Miami sound machine, which was an awesome touch.  The bath had a great shower, but only a single sink.  There is tons of space to put all of your stuff and outlets to charge all of the gadgets in your Batbelt, which included a big walk in closet.  We enjoyed beers on our patio lounge, but it just got too hot for us.  An umbrella or some kind of shade out there would have been perfect.  They really took care of us here.  Breakfast was delivered to the room in a picnic basket, the staff was helpful and welcoming at every turn and even flawlessly dealt with our early departure.  Which is more than I can say for the overwhelmed Charleston airport TSA.    We had a wonderful stay at the Restoration and certainly return when back in town.The Restoration on King is up there with the Five Pine Lodge in Sisters Oregon, the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego and the Biltmore in Miami as one of the finest and most enjoyable hotels I've ever stayed in.It is a boutique hotel in every sense of the word - brilliantly appointed loft rooms, effortlessly friendly and gracious service, and an overall sense of relaxation and ease that it almost impossible to create. The rooms themselves are enormous, with full granite kitchens, comfortable seating areas and huge windows. The bed is excellent, tucked away in a lofted room. The bathroom is spacious and nicely appointed.The perks of staying there include a cheese reception at 5 and a cookie reception at 8, as well as a gratis breakfast delivered to your door every morning in a basket.If you are staying in Charleston, there is no better place for you to be.Wonderful wonderful wonderful hotel!!!!!! It is located right off of king street. Couldn't ask for a better location. The suites are beautiful and huge! Our suite was a one bedroom with a full AND a half bath, a living room, dining area and a full kitchen. Breakfast is delivered every morning to your room in a picnic basket. You fill out a menu the night before of all the food you want for breakfast. So amazing! Also, every evening wine and cheese are served between 5-6p and port is served a little later around 8p. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Can't say enough good things about this hotel. You must stay here when you visit Charleston.Fantastic hotel. Essentially, ROK is a boutique property comprised of one bedroom condos with more space than you'll get at almost all hotels in downtown Charleston. Here's the long list of reasons that led to 5 stars: - Perfect location off King - Very large, modern rooms - essentially luxury 1 bed condos w/ full kitchen &amp; washer/dryer - Breakfast is included, but not some lame buffet. You choose off a menu and breakfast is delivered outside your door in a picnic basket.  Have never seen anything like it - awesome! - Internet is fast and simple to jump on - Great night's sleep - Staff was great - Wine &amp; Cheese early evening &amp; fresh baked cookies at night - Fantastic value - $229/night when the Renaissance wanted $199/night - no brainerIt's easy  to see why ROK is a Travelers' Choice 2012 Top 25 Winner.Home from home - loft style apartments. Excellent meet &amp; greet and easy valet park to welcome you to this superb hotel alternative. The apartment I had was very spacious with excellent full kitchen facilities including in-room laundry appliances which was appreciated after 3 weeks touring around Florida &amp; Georgia.The apartments are a good specification with all the usual home comforts. The hotel style services are professional with breakfast delivered to your room which was a nice way to start the day. I am only staying for a few days but could easily stay here comfortably for a longer period.The added bonus is that it is also located in the heart of the historic district by King St!!!!Beautiful hotel in a great location in downtown Charleston. The staff were very hospitable, particularly liked the picnic breakfast in the morning. The rooms as others have noticed are enormous, and it looks like this may have been built as a condo.We were in Charleston for a wedding and had a patio room, we had people over a couple of nights, and the place can easily handle 10 people in the living room.  We didn't use the patio, ended up using the roof deck since it had a much better view.I tried staying here for New Year's Eve.We made the reservations a few days before, showed up, but it didn't work out.  Apparently their online system is not synced with their front desk, and they overbooked.And while it still blows my mind that this can happen in 2011, they did the right thing. They were kind and apologetic.  And they booked (and paid for) us to stay at another nearby hotel.I'd still like to stay here someday.Wow!  This place is absolutely incredible!  Gorgeous room - great service.  Location can't be beat. Suite is very spacious - I even got a load of laundry in. Kitchen actually had refreshments,  and a wonderful breakfast was provided - which you selected. Staff was incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable - and I ask a lot of questions. Highly recommend, and reasonable considering all that is provided.","This hotel is absolutely amazing. The look and feel is so unique. The staff are so nice and were extremely helpful. We arrived to a fridge full of travel Cokes/Sprite/Water bottles for our walks down the wonderful King St, right in the heart of downtown Charleston.The hotel is located in the perfect part of the city. We literally did not use our car until we got back in it for the drive back home. You can walk just about everywhere you'd want to go on a three day trip.The rooms are huge! It has a loft feel and full of modern charm. The appliances were very nice and they had plates, silverware, mixing bowls and more if you wanted to cook while you're in town. They also offer to stock your fridge full of groceries if you call ahead and give a shopping list. They also provided a picnic basket full of food for breakfast every morning.We thought about using a bed and breakfast for our trip but we couldn't have been happier with where we stayed. I wish I could live in a place like this!This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in bar none.  We are very selective about accommodations, and this hotel satisfied us.  To begin with, we were told the ""rooms"" were originally intended to be sold as condos, but instead the owner decided on a boutique hotel.  With that, the rooms are actually apartments.  We had a one bedroom unit with a living room, kitchen, laundry room, and master bathroom.  The building's architecture is great, and each room is decorated with exposed brick, earthy tones, and refurbished wood floors; in other words, all of the charm of a Charleston building! The bed was ultra comfortable, and the pillows were great too; nothing like typical cheap hotel pillows.  A great night's sleep for all five nights we were there.  The hotel staff makes you want for nothing.  All requests were granted, and in a timely fashion.  When we checked in, we even were greeted with a chilled bottle of sparkling wine and a hand-written note welcoming us.  Each evening there is a breakfast menu in the room to fill out, and the next morning, a complimentary breakfast is delivered in a picnic basket to the door (nice touch!).  Each afternoon they have free wine and cheese in the lobby, and each evening free milk and fresh cookies.  As for location, you could not be more central in the city.  Everything in the city is within a five to ten minute walk.  King Street right outside the door is clearly the premier shopping area as there are many trendy stores and boutiques.  There are tons of restaurants in the area, and the staff of the hotel will make you reservations and recommend places as well.  Will definitely return to this hotel and Charleston.  A great place to visit, and a great place to stay.This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. Valet parking, check. Beautiful lobby with wines and cheese, check. Escorted to my room, check. Gigantic room, check. Gigantic room that's bigger than my current apartment and is much nicer and cleaner and more spacious, check. Tour of my gigantic room that's bigger, nicer, cleaner yada yada yada and more spacious, check. For the first several hours, I was doing laps in the hotel just so I felt I used every inch of it. Great breakfast delivered in a picnic basket with a newspaper, check. The bed was really comfortable. The bathroom facilities were nice. A full kitchen. A washer &amp; dryer. Beautiful view of King Street. Which leads to the best last point: the location. Right on King Street. I felt spoiled. And it was a nice feeling.AMAZING HOTEL! We stayed at this hotel for 5 days following our wedding. I travel a lot and have been told that I am ""hotel bourgie"" and I loved it here! It was beautiful. HUGE rooms, everything in the place looks new. Stainless  steel appliances, hard wood floors, very comfortable beds, spotless bathrooms. The service was amazing as well. The owner of the hotel is around all the time and is very friendly. He knew us by name by the 2nd day and offered tips on beaches and restaurants. The location can't be beat. It's near everything you want to do in Charleston. My husband and I loved it here and will definitely stay here on future trips to charleston!this place is pricey, and worth every penny.our 3rd room had a great view, comfy couch, 40"" flat screen, full kitchen with marble counters, stainless steel full size fridge (great for those left overs) - lofted bed room with a big puffy comforter  breakfast (bagels, muffins, danish, coffee ) arrives in a picnic basket, and we had it on the roofnice afternoon wine and cheese, complimentary ipads/bikes -- wonderful room coffeemake sure to find the roof top deck, the view is worth every stepLet me start off by stating that I grew up in Charleston and go back every year to visit friends.  You get what you pay for!  Typically stay at places such as the Charleston Place, but after having sub-par service there for the last several years my wife decided we needed a change.  Great service started the moment we pulled the car up front of the hotel.  The bellman came right over and didn't even ask ""do you need help with your bags"", he simply said ""we have it, just go on in and have some refreshments"".  Contemporary and Charming is the best way to describe the lobby.  We did arrive early, so we expected the rooms to not be ready.  The staff locked up our luggage, took my cell phone number, and offered to call us when the room was ready (which they actually did).  The general manager (Howard) stopped by to welcome us and offered to help us get into any restaurants that we might be interested in.  Since we always meet up with friends, my wife had already taken care of hitting all of the hot spots months in advance.  Even though we were early, Howard cracked a couple of bottles of wine for my wife and another couple who were traveling this time with us.  Not going to bore everyone with all of our activities while we were down here, but do want ot point out a few things:Rooms - There are about 15 rooms located on the second and third floor.  The one bedroom is a loft style room and has a ""Full"" den and kitchen.  Like our good friends who were traveling with us, we have stayed in suites at the Four Seasons, The Ritz, etc., and I will tell you that these rooms are outstanding.  The whole layout screamed ""relax here"".Service - All of the staff was very attentive and were always trying to make sure we were happy.  Howard really did stand out in making sure that everyone was taken care of.  From something as simple as getting us some wine on the early side to arranging a bike taxi to pick up my wife and I within only 3 minutes of advance notice (as usual we were running late to a dinner engagement) and also at the same time getting someone up to our room to fix the automatic lock that decided to get stop working on the front door just as we were scrambling to get to the dinner.Extras - Every morning we had a picnic basket in front of our door with a USA Today paper and fresh items for us to enjoy.  Extra charge for this...$0.  Fridge is restocked with soft drinks and water by housekeeping.....and once again you didn't get nickled and dimed for this (its included).  Wi-Fi (while not the strongest signal of any place I have stayed) was included at no additional cost as well.  Wine tasting with fruit and cheese each day in the lobby and also night time cookies.     For those who you who enjoying hitting the gym, the hotel provides a daily free membership to Eco Fitness (about a block down from the hotel) as well.Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the furnished private rooftop to enjoy magnificient views of downtown.Typically we have stated at Charleston Place while visiting Charleston, but opted to try this new spot and were extremely impressed.  The hotel consists of 17 luxury condos that were converted to hotel rooms.  The room we stated in was spacious with high ceilings and a nice private balcony.  Valet parking was reasonable and staff was attentive.  They also deliver a newspaper and good complementary breakfast each day (coffee, juices, scones, muffins, fruit, granola, yogurt, etc).  Cheese and wine for free earlier on and free cookies later in the evening.  Location is excellent, close to the good shopping and a few steps away from the good restaurants.  This will be our new go-to lodging while visiting Charleston.  Its nice to have more space than a bland hotel bed; it would be excellent for a group of people as it provides a place to meet up.  Also, each unit has a full kitchen and several large, modern flatscreen TVs, etc.",,,,"['typically', 'mid', 'range', 'hotels', 'travel', 'hotel', 'choice', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'felt', 'like',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/ansonborough-inn-charleston,Ansonborough Inn,4.0,$$,44,"In a city with very pricey accommodations, the Ansonborough Inn is a find. It's not cheap, but for what you get, it's wonderful. We stayed in a suite, which was huge and had a fireplace. The room decor does need to be updated, but the high ceilings, exposed brick walls and views to the Charleston streets more than makes up for it. There is a great rooftop deck and the staff was very friendly. If you don't want to drop $600 on a room in Charleston, but still be downtown in a historic inn, this is the place.Agreed with other reviews that the Ansonborough is at a crossroads. The price point doesn't fit the experience. It either needs to go whole hog, bump up the price and full realize the potential that it has. Or, it can lower the price and continue along as is. But it cannot maintain the status quo. If it does, it can expect a bunch of middling-to-bad reviews and that's not entirely fair to what the hotel has going on. Like I said, there's potential.I arrived at the hotel ready to relax. My flight from Nashville was fine. My trip to the hotel was pleasant (thanks to Maurice from R&amp;S Limo). And, when I showed up at the front door, I was happy with what I saw: lots of brick, lots of plants, sufficient Southern character. Sounds good. I arrived a little later than expected on a hot Friday in mid-summer. I wanted a drink but was nearing the end of the cocktail. So, imagine my happiness when, after greeting me, the front desk offered me TWO glasses of wine so that I could get my check-in on in style. Things are looking up. They got better when I received an upgrade. It seems a couple of their Friday reservations canceled, so I was bumped to room 210. I like. The room itself had a lot of charm: extremely high ceilings, exposed beams, exposed brick, a small living area, a proper wooden desk... all good things. But, the room was only halfway there. The bathroom was serviceable, if not comparable to the first impression of the room. The refrigerator was bare, there was a sink in the corner of the room that didn't seem to go with the aesthetic and (most importantly), my sheets weren't properly laundered. There are few things as first-world-problematic as mealy sheets in an expensive room when you want to lay your head. Even worse, when I called to get new sheets -- that's all I received. I made my own king bed. Now, I am not too good to make my own bed. But, barring being eight years old and having chores to do or needing to impress house guests that I am a fully functioning adult, making the bed isn't something on my usual playlist and it, certainly, isn't something I expect to do when staying at a hotel. So, that was a let down. And the sheets... well, Oprah would not be giving them away as her favorite things any time soon. The doors/walls are fairly thin so if you're a light sleeper or are traveling to be/do the nasty, be warned.That said, I appreciated the historic charm of the hotel and proximity to downtown happenings. Given the outward character, I was surprised (in a good way) with the modern touches of the lobby. The glass elevator is a nice accent. The hotel serves breakfast and has a nice dining area complete with coffee, tea, water, and lemonade. Oh, and cookies. Fresh cookies are always a plus. You see what I'm talking about? Potential. Personally, I think given the ridiculous real estate and price point in Charleston, the Ansonborough just needs to give in to the market, raise the price, fix all the problems, and offer guests the experience they expect to have once they look at the website and do the math. Being stuck in the middle is doing no one (hotel included) any favors.Ansonborough Inn21 Hassel StCharleston SCWe recently spent four nights here and love the Charleston area. The Ansonborough inn is located within two blocks of market St and near the water. It is truly an architectural gem, decorated nicely and well maintained. The rooms were large and comfortable. It also has a rooftop terrace with a decent view of the river and bridge. We found the folks at the front desk to be extra friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. The criticism I have is for the owners. If you're going to offer a continental breakfast do it right. The fruit was ok but the pancakes and eggs were horrible microwave stuff. Do your guests a favor and get a waffle iron and let the guests fix their own waffles. You might want to mention to the kitchen staff that they should be courteous to guests as well. I would have given Ansonborough 4 stars for the desk staff alone but the reason is a biggie and the single main reason people get a room. SLEEPING on fine linens! The sheets made the bed feel like a hospital bed. They were rough and worse yet, didn't fit the mattress. You guys really  need to spend a little more and get really good bedding. Urban Cowgill December 2015This place looks fantastic but I would not recommend staying here. I could clearly hear the conversations of the room next to us,  as well as their tv...and they weren't yelling. Road noise was also a big problem. It has gorgeous rooms and a rustic feel,  but the room noise is just too muchAt a lower price point, they'd get a 3.The good:-Comfy bed (not in the league of hotels at a similar price point, but comfortable. Crisp sheets with a moderate thread count)-really nice housekeeping staff (I stayed two nights, left the ""do not disturb"" sign and they kindly left me a basket of towels and shampoo outside my door)///my room was clean (my coworker, OTOH, found long hairs on his sheets)-gorgeous lobby with exposed beams and soaring atrium that makes you feel like you're about to enter a rustic chic boutique hotel...Only, you're not. I'm afraid the bad outweighs the good. The main thing: it really could use one of those hotel makeover guys in here. It's so incredibly outdated. For example, Andes mints left on the pillow and ""do not disturb/maid clean room"" signs that remind me of being a kid at a Holiday Inn circa 1982. Neither are a really big deal, but it's just to give potential guests an idea.My room on the first floor was dreary. It led right to the street (there's even a glass door to the street that you can't open, but it's still unsettling) and had no natural light, so the room was perpetually depressing. The ceilings have are wood-paneled. The carpet seems old. Each room has what seems to be mismatched old furniture (my room had shabby overstuffed love seat and arm chair, while my coworker's had a pleather couch and a table). The furniture is crammed in there and makes you feel claustrophobic. Don't expect a bathrobe (at this price point, I would) and towels are rough and thin. No mini bar. Not even a bottle of water, which is especially unacceptable, as waking up to a glass of tepid tap water is really not a great way to start the day. You can attempt to get some water in the hospitality room... if anyone fills the water thermos. Then there's the ""work out room."" Even a carefully placed mirror won't give you the impression that this is anything but a single treadmill, a single elliptical and a small cable weight unit in a florescent- lit closet. There isn't even a water cooler in there. Again, with the lack of accessible water. And a final note: it's family-friendly. Which isn't awesome when you're here for work (picture 6 am screams and shouts echoing around that beautiful atrium lobby). If you can get a room at a good discount, sure, go for it as it's not the worst place in the world. Do. Not. Pay. Their asking price. For that, you should be in a Westin or Omni, not a (barely) glorified La Quinta with a nicer lobby. Staying here should cost one half the price.Quirky place in a decent location. About a 10 minute walk to the main tourist area of King St. Our room (palmetto suite) was huge and outdated. For the price is expect at least a nice sofa or mini bar, but the brown velvet sofa had white gunk on it and the small fridge was iced over and empty. The grossest part was the carpet. It had so many splatters, stains and black marks.....it made me question the cleanliness of the entire place. Oh and the exposed brick wall behind our bed was crumbling and there was white dust behind the bed and night stands that was never cleaned up. The cover of one of the complimentary magazines in the room was covered in food splatters (not ours). This place is not cheap! In the end I left grossed out. Would not stay again.A charming hotel with a wonderful ambiance. The lobby is breathtaking as you enter, with a beautfiul fireplace and high ceilings with exposed beams. The Front Desk and Housekeeing staff were friendly with the perfect amount of Southern Charm. They were always accomodating and had wonderful suggestions regarding the area. The rooms were very comfortable. Breakfast is served every morning in the common area and a complimentary wine and cheese hour was an added bonus. I wish we could have enoyed the lovely roof deck, alas it was rainy the weekend we were there. The hotel is a quick walk to Historic Charleston's main attractions, such as the City Market and Rainbow Row. For late night snacks there is a 24 hour Harris Teeter directly next door. A beautiful hotel in one of the most beautiful cities.Beautiful restored building.... And then there's the road noise.Lovely post and been construction.... And then there the traffic noise.Kind, nice staff... And then there's the noise outside that starts at 5:30amLots of reasons to stay here..... If you don't need your sleep. And the there's the parking:(This hotel is the best deal within charleston proper. I'll give it that much. For the price, it is somewhat outdated. I understand the vibe they are going for and they've achieved it somewhat, it just needs a little rejuvenation. That being said, everyone within the hotel has been incredibly kind. They do their best to provide amenities (free breakfast, roof deck, cheese and wine hour). Everything has been incredibly clean and the neutrogena bath products are a nice touch. I don't think I would pony up the hefty price to stay here again. You can stay elsewhere about ten minutes away for a third of the price.Lovely hotel with very nice staff. Our 3rd floor room was very quiet, clean &amp; elegant. The rooftop gathering space was a big plus. We also enjoyed the wine &amp; cheese available in the evening. This hotel is walking distance to anywhere downtown.  We were able to head S on a run through parks and historic districts and head N to run the Arthur Ravenel Jr Bridge.If we visit Charleston again we will definitely choose Ansonborough Inn.restaurants within walking distanceWe recommend eating at 82 Queen for a nice couples lunch, Bay Street Biergarten for a nice brew pub, the Gin Joint for drinks, Fleet Landing for outdoor dining.As others have said, this hotel is in a good (not great) location, being right across from a 24 hour supermarket which is actually pretty handy, but about a 10-15 minute walk from the main tourist area. However, it is only 3-5 minutes away from the stop for the free trolley which takes one all over town.The room we had, 337, was on the corner of the third floor and was basically a one bedroom apartment with a large bedroom with a comfortable kingsize bed and lots of closet and drawer space, a spacious living area with a bar sink, small fridge and microwave, a table for four and a reasonably-new sofa and two old, dirty, wingback chairs with ottomans.  The living room and bedroom each had a 32-inch or so flat screen TV. We loved having the bathroom off the living area because one person could sleep and the other be in the living area and not disrupt the other.  Breakfast was pretty good with hard-boiled eggs being offered only on one of our five days and the only hot cereal being the instant oatmeal-type.  Pastries and breads were fine and the fruit was okay.  Wine and cheese in the evening (and their pimento cheese dip) were much better; good crackers and cheeses, decent wine and that delicious dip with a bit of a kick. However comfortable our room and  however friendly the front desk staff, the HUGE drawback was the WORST shower we have ever experienced - and we have traveled all over the world.  For $250 on the weeknight and $350 on Friday night, we should have a good shower!   When we told the front desk, they sent a maintenance man who went to the hardware store and changed out the shower head.  Now instead of a fine mist, we had a trickle of water - definitely not better.  Finally on the last day Daniel said he had a room we could change to, but we weren't going to do that since we were getting ready to leave.  Graciously, he put that room out of order and allowed us to shower there, which was a big improvement over our shower.  When the manager returned on Monday, I expected a call, apology and some reimbursement.  Basically, she inferred that we were complainers, that the next guests had no problem with the shower, and that the maintenance men and her all determined that nothing is wrong with it.  She gave us $170 compensation.  We are actually people who don't complain about things but having to use the barely-better tub faucet made us definitely crabby, especially since we had to deal with this for five days.Even in October, Charleston is muggy and warm so we really wanted a decent shower!!!  Bottom line, don't stay in room 337 or check the shower first before you stay in the room.  We believe customer service is a priority and for what they charge, should have done something better.  We won't be going back!P.S.  Free wi-fi worked great in all areas of the hotel.Great experience! My husband and I stayed on Christmas Day and there was a stocking on the bed filled with yummy snacks and candy. There was hot apple cider and cookies downstairs as well. Complimentary breakfast which is always a plus. Our room was awesome. We stayed in the Palmetto Suite which was HUGE! Larger than most studios I've seen in NYC. Good location not a bad walk to the restaurants, bars and shopping. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Charleston.We loved loved loved this place! Its exactly what youd expect to find in Charleston. They even still do the mints on the pillows. The cheese and wine at 5pm is the cherry on top. The breakfast doesnt have much protein but the spread isnt bad. I got what I paid for and more. The location is great. Everything is 4-7 minutes away when walking.We had a wonderful stay at the Ansonborough for a long weekend in September. It is filled with charm and completely unique. Loved the rooftop patio and the wine and cheese hour every evening. Our room was very comfortable- the only complaint we had was the noise level. We tried to nap in the late afternoon and there seemed to be a lot going on throughout the hotel and on street outside. Otherwise, we had an AMAZING time and would definitely return!My wife and I visited Charleston this past Labor day weekend. We stayed at Ansonborough for 2 nights, and it was great. The decor is fantastic, the room we got was very nice and comfortable, the art in the building is great, and the fact that they have an included continental breakfast just tops it off. It's a bit out of the way from all of the main restaurants, but not more than a 15 minute walk from wherever you'd like to go. There's a nice 24 hour grocery store right next to the hotel as well.Rooms were about half the price of comparable hotels closer to the main attractions, but walking an extra 10 or 15 minutes was worth saving the money. It's a beautiful hotel, and the only negatives I can say about it is that the walls are VERY thin, we could hear and understand conversations in the rooms next to and above us. Overall, very nice, one of the best hotels I've stayed at, would return.Stayed August 2014What a perfect place for our girlfriend get-away!  There were 6 of us in 2 rooms, plenty of space in one of the ""Premium Loft"" and a ""Double Luxury"". The wine and cheese was wonderful, tasty and they didn't mind a bit when we took ours up to the roof terrace. One morning we did yoga on the roof too, a great spot. The decor is beautiful, an old-world feel with plenty of wood beams and paneling. But it's a renovated warehouse so no ""old-world"" plumbing or electric...Breakfast was more than we expected and the cinnamon buns! We all went off our diets for those. Friendly and helpful staff too. (Thank you Daniel and Carrie.)Tips: Prices are high in Charleston, this Inn was pricey for anywhere else but midrange for Charleston. There is a handy 24 hour big grocery store across the street, we didn't find any other quick place downtown to buy necessities. We didn't hear any noise from it except a trash truck one morning, no biggie considering the convenience. If you can, get a Premium loft! Well worth the minor up-charge. Earthling day spa was great and about a block down the street. Palmetto Carriage with the ""Big Red Barn"" for the horse carriage tours also is very convenient, just a block away. Liberty square and the aquarium where you catch the boat to tour Fort Sumter is also in easy walking distance, to the north.Really loved this inn...built in 1901.   Rooms are clean and comfortable with a lot of character, including antiques and paintings but with all the modern comforts.In need of a last minute hotel room after a bad experience our first night at Embassy Suites up the road, we stumbled upon Ansonborough Inn and I'm so glad we did!  Nearly every hotel was booked for the weekend, but we were able to get the last vacant room here.  I was a little uncertain of what to expect, as hotels like this can really be hit or miss.The atmosphere of the hotel was unique, warm, and inviting.  Our suite was huge, well laid out, and clean with a comfy leather couch and flat screen TV that truly made you feel as though you were in your own little one bedroom condo in downtown Charleston.  Not to mention the fact that their room rates were significantly lower than just about every other hotel in downtown Charleston, including the Days Inn. The staff was great and they had a complimentary wine and cheese hour in the social room that was a really nice touch.Definitely recommend staying here!This is a very comfortable and interesting place to stay.  We were able to walk everywhere,  and the bed was very comfortable.  One word of caution.  We took a taxi from the airport and it was about $30.  It was a metered taxi as you would expect.  When we left I asked the front desk to arrange a taxi to the airport. Not a driver, or limo...a taxi.   What we got was a ginormous black SUV that charged us $45 for the 20 minute drive to the airport.  Do yourself a favor and arrange your own transportation.Stunning. Immaculate. Key Location. These words are exactly representative of this place. Highly recommended to stay. We stayed in the Scarborough Suite and from the bed to the soaking tub, our room will be unforgettable.","A Best Western at best. Our room was two twin beds pushed together to make it look like a king sized bed. It felt like we slept on plywood as opposed to a mattress as well. Seems like they are cutting costs as much as possible, at the expense of the guest. Location is the only good thing here. Continental breakfast was scarce. Don't be fooled by the attempt to look like a fancy hotel with picture frames &amp; chandeliers. They are made of glass, not crystal.Great place, near the City Market and everything really. Staff was really nice, the rooms very comfortable (2 adults 3 kids in a double room with a sofa bed and we were not cramped) , hot breakfast with assorted variety; and to top it off, free wine and cheese at 5 pm.I traveled to Charleston for the first time ever to photograph my friend proposing to his girlfriend during the Cooper River Bridge Run. My friend booked a room at this hotel, gave them his credit card number and got a confirmation from the hotel. During my stay, I was asked for my card for incidentals (I assumed). Upon me leaving, I realized the hotel charged me for the room to the tune of $1000 for the stay. When I called and asked them to reverse the charges, they asked for my friend to call and verify his card to finalize the transaction... which he did. When I checked my account 2 hours later, there were 2 more charges for $840 ($1680 total) for the same room that was not supposed to be charged to me. So in total, I was charged $2700! I was told the person that made the mistake was gone for the day (it was Sunday) and would take care of the issue the following day. On top of all this, the cab company they trusted so much was called to take me to the airport for my travels. Flight was at 6:40, so the cab was reserved for 5:30. Cab did not show which caused me to miss my flight and essentially turn my 1 way trip to Houston (2 hour flight) into a 20 hour standby fiasco that ended with me renting a car from San Antonio and driving back home. The level of incompetence is absolutely unbelievable and I will let everyone I know to avoid this very beautiful hotel due to the lack of customer service they have on the back side.I've stayed here a bunch-- for work and for fun, because it is usually reasonably priced in comparison to other downtown Charleston hotels.  Out of season, more reasonably than in-season of course, and a recent long weekend averaged a little over $300/night which included taxes and the $12 parking surcharge.The people who work here are great.  The rooms are a bit of a mix of old-timey but classic furniture, mid-century pieces, and desks that do not fit in and look like they came from a flea market.The wireless internet is free.  Some of the carpets are really dirty.  Finally, be careful-- if you get stuck on the ground floor, whether on the Hasell Street side (which is a bit more quiet) or the East Bay Side (louder than my NYC apartment above freaking Houston Street!), you are in for a bit of a wild ride (lookout Room 115!).  These rooms should not be let except for a very deep discount with full disclosure.  Shame on the hotel for not taking that tack.The complimentary breakfast and wine/cheese cocktail hour are perfectly adequate.  The ""workout room"" is a bit of a joke-- it has a treadmill and one piece of equipment I have never seen before; however, in nice weather, you can jog to the new bridge -- the base of which is approximately a mile from the door.So, overall an adequate property and despite some quirks, I will definitely stay here again.Wow! What a gem!  A converted warehouse with exposed brick walls and wood beams in an intimate setting.  Conveniently located near everything.  Across the street from a 24 hr supermarket.  Our room, # 333, was huge! King sized comfortable bed, large bathroom, couch, large window facing east, and very high ceilings. Very quiet.  Front desk was very helpful. The included breakfast was fine.  We'll stay there again!I had reserved a room for my client to stay at the Ansonbourough during the Cooper River Bridge Run weekend. Now this weekend is probably the biggest weekend for Charleston, so I understand the inflated prices ($800 for 2 nights).My client had a nice stay, but when it came time to leave his appointed early morning cab wasn't there, which made him miss his flight, and turns out they charged HIS credit card instead of mine which was originally placed with the reservation. Not only that, he was charged THREE TIMES! Make that $2,600!!!!!!!!!But wait there is more. I check my account, and I've been charged TWICE! $1600!!The dominoes keep falling.Surely I can speak with the manager and make some sense of this this missed cab ride and quadruple $800 charge...I call the manager and she was very unhelpful and pulled the ""I'm just as upset as you"" card. Considering how much the rooms were overpriced, there wasn't even a hint of a refund or incentive to return to the Ansonborough.This makes me look VERY bad to my client. I love Charleston and will be back for my wedding next year... but staying FAR away from this place.This is such a great place to stay.  It was my second visit (the first time I stayed at Planter's Inn.  I like Ansonborough better).  Not only is the location prime (we walked everywhere) but the staff is also extremely nice (from the housekeepers to the ladies working the kitchen/continental breakfast/wine hour to the (after hours) lady at the front desk).  The front desk (Daniel?) was helpful recommending places to eat, etc.  The only negative was the street noise early in the morning.  I'll stay here again next visit for sure!Absolutely delightful. We booked a loft room for my bachelorette party, which allowed all five of us to be in one space. We had more than enough room and the extra half bath was essential with five women! The website does not do the hotel justice, it is gorgeous inside! Very unique and worth skipping the chain hotels for the charm of the Ansonborough Inn. Staff was helpful and friendly, recommending restaurants and arranging for early morning cab service. Evening wine and cheese reception and breakfast pastries are nice touches.My husband and I  loved our stay here at AI! We did some research and many of the B&amp;B in Charleston are well over $200, but AI was at a reasonable price. We got an upgrade from the King Studio to a Luxury Room since we mentioned we were celebrating out anniversary.  The room was very spacious!  There was a bar area and living room area with comfy couches and chairs.  The bathroom had marble and granite and Bath and Body Works toiletries.  It was very clean and comfortable! AI isn't in the heart of Charleston, but a couple of blocks away from the shops and restaurants.  There is also a Harris Teeter across from the Inn and Parking is $12 across the street too. We didn't drive anywhere all weekend. The continental breakfast included cereal, bagels, muffins, fruit, oatmeal, along with boiled eggs and mini sausage biscuits. The staff was friendly and the Inn was just lovely.  The only negative is that we could hear everything in the room above us.  At one point we heard part of someone conversation. Besides that, I would def stay here again!My husband and I stayed at Ansonborough Inn on June 1st 2012. Our flight got in late, so we didn't show up until 9:30 PM. We had to wait a couple minutes for someone to come to the front desk, which didn't bother us at all. They upgraded us to a larger room, which was room #109. This room was on the main floor right by one of the main streets. I had read another review about this particular room and they mentioned that it was noisy. Yes you could hear some of the outside noise, but it wasn't to the point where it prevented you from sleeping. It would be just like at home. Other things we enjoyed:~Convenience to all the downtown restaurants, bars and activities (walking distance)~Decent breakfast with hot and cold foods~Comfortable bed~Room was big with a sitting area (not that you spend much time in your room anyway)~Very helpful &amp; friendly staff, provided ideas for places to eat and gave directions~We were able to keep our luggage at the hotel after we checked out while we were walking around down town and at the pier. We picked it up later when our ride showed up.Overall we enjoyed the architecture and the fell of the hotel and the staff was wonderful. Would definitely stay again if we return to the area!We've stayed at a different hotel every time we've visited Charleston, and this will be a one and done, too. I wanted to try a new place that was within walking distance to most of historic Charleston, and this place fit the bill. We didn't rent a car this time and it was no problem! In fact, when we wanted to get closer to the Medical University, we went to a bike shop around the corner and rode our bikes over there. The rooms were fine. Very high ceilings and a decent sized room given the historic age of this hotel. I was disappointed that our bathroom wasn't updated as advertised. There was a lot of external noise... we were very close to the docks and it made sleeping in on vacation.The breakfast left a lot to be desired. There was nothing fresh and the grits were instant! Blasphemy! We didn't make the breakfast mistake more than once... every other morning we ate out. The happy hour was fine. The pimento cheese was very good and very Southern. Really, the best thing about this restaurant is it's location.I booked this hotel based on proximity to the cruise terminal for a one-night stay prior to sailing.  While the cruise was abysmal, the stay in Charleston at the Ansonborough was impeccable.  We kind of wished that the cruise had been canceled so we could just stay there.  We had a king room with vaulted ceilings.  The space was impressively renovated, with attention paid to the original beam and woodwork.  The bathroom was clean with nice hot water (not always the case in even some of the finest hotels).We had exceptional service with a great restaurant recommendation.  Check-in and check-out were seamless.  Parking was easy, which I gather isn't true for all Charleston hotels.  The location was great as well.The only less-than-exceptional points were the continental breakfast (nothing special) and the fitness center.  There is no ventilation in the fitness center and only one treadmill and some weights.  It was stifling and steamy after only a mile and a half on the treadmill.  But then again, I don't think many people go to Charleston to work out in an enclosed space.  Use the location to your advantage and run or walk outside, if it's not too warm.Not only would I stay there again, but I'm booking my parents a stay there for their anniversary.The rooms in the Ansonborough Inn are spacious and nice.  The vaulted ceilings have to be at least 18 foot ceilings, but I do not really know how high they are.  The rooms come equipped with a ceiling fan and their own AC/Heat unit, not that one would ever need heat in South Carolina.  The architecture of the rooms, the ceilings, the moldings, and the bed are all very quaint and nice.  The bed was comfortable and provided a great place to sleep.In terms of location, the Ansonborough Inn is on the outskirts of the market but fortunately right across the street from a Harris Teeter grocery store - which helps with the purchase of cheap bottled water by the case for your time in the heat in South Carolina.  The downsides of the hotel:1.  It's proximity to the port.  We could hear the port workers in the early hours of the morning - probably around 6ish - and the persistent beeping of the dock equipment when put in reverse as they transferred goods. 2.  It's proximity to Market street outside of the actual market means people can drive faster and do.  Plus, because it is on the outskirts, there seemed to be a lot of motorcycles who liked the bar almost directly across the street.3.  The maid service in the hotel did a pretty half-ass job of cleaning our room every single day.  We weren't exactly ""green"" so we always left our towels on the floor - the new universal sign for replace my towels - but they did not.  Additionally, they did not clean the bathroom as a whole all that well each day - which makes me question whether my whole room was cleaned.Funky space and easy walking made this a great, less expensive, respite for our one night Charleston stay.PROS:AMAZING decorFriendly staffPrivate parking lotRooftop terraceLarge roomsGreat locationLow rates ($189 for Junior Suite)CONS:Woke up at 2am to a lot of drunk people in the parking lot next to building. We actually called the cops because they were 'hanging out' in the parking lot until almost 3am and we couldn't go to sleep.Shower was not cleaned. There was long black hair and globs of conditioner in the shower.The people in the room above us kept us up late because we could hear everywhere they stepped...and for some strange reason they were walking around a lot! (Old building = very noisy)We lucked out during a frantic search for a hotel in the historic district of Charleston the night before our trip and booked a room at this warehouse-turned historic inn.  The location is centrally-located and right off of East Bay.  It is an easy two blocks to where all stores and restaurants on East Bay.The furnishings can be best described as British-hunting-centric.  There are countless ornately-framed paintings of dogs: small dogs, big dogs, dogs in fields, dogs hunting with pheasants in the background...you get the picture.  Each room is different, and ours had a small sitting area as well as tall ceilings, as all rooms do.  There were only two windows in the huge room, and both of these had shutters on them to keep the light out, so it was rather dim the entire stay.  There were plenty of paintings of animals to look at.  :)The Inn serves water, iced tea, lemonade, and cookies during the day, and has a wine and cheese hour at 5pm.  This serve-yourself-spread is a nice touch, and held us over before dinner and after a day of walking around.  Breakfast, however, was disappointing as they had no hot foods, just your typical cereal, pieces of limp fruit, and some juice. The coffee is kept hot at all hours, and there is a free business center with Internet.  Parking is $12.Overall, I had a great visit and enjoyed the stay at the Ansonborough.  This was a spacious and unique inn in the heart of Charleston with plenty of character.Stayed over the following dates: Aug 12-Aug14th (A/C worked great). Stayed in the Petite King. Pros: Got a great rate - internet special $159. Compared to others on kayak and the cheapest 4 star + came in at $209. The room, and Inn, was extremely nice and very cozy. Downtown location and great for walking to sites etc...This is not the first time we have stayed here, and we will continue to book this place for our trips to Charleston.Cons: Pillows - I like big fluffy pillows, our room had thin stiff pillows. I know this is a very weak con.This place was amazing!  We didn't expect much from the picture on the website but we needed something for one night in an emergency.  WOW! The room was HUGE, and absolutely beautiful! The nightly wine and cheese was yummy and the breakfast was wonderful and plentiful!  Staff were helpful too. We wish we could have stayed longer!  One of the best kept secrets in Charleston! We will be back!!!Incredibly friendly staff, beautiful rooms, very centrally located...so why only 4 stars? The price of the room. Good lawd is it expensive. And the awesome, old-timey bar was unattended...even though it said it was open during the hours I stopped by. That said, they have a nice breakfast and you can use their computers. The decor is wonderful in the lobby and in the rooms. I really liked that they had a refrigerator in my room as well. I probably shouldn't give only 4 stars as the rates are comparable to most other hotels in that area near Liberty Square. But I think it fits.Great hotel!  Room was large enough for 2 couples with seperate bedroom and pull out couch.  Very friendly staff, good location off E. Bay Street.  Moderately priced compared to most hotels located downtown.  One of the coolest looking lobby's with all the wood beams; high ceiling and sky lights.","Far better than expected. Great wine &amp; cheese in the evening &amp; an excellent array of breakfast choices in the AM. Location is the best. Our room was on ground floor... not a lot of street noise but it was stormy so not a lot of walkers. I highly recommend this placeStayed one night for a business trip and was very impressed by the charm and conveniences of this small downtown hotel.  The rooms were spacious, with ~very~ high ceilings, and the decor certainly matched the ""feel"" of Charleston, SC.  My room was impeccably clean, and the maids were friendly and attentive, asking me as I was checking in to let them know if I needed anything.  The front desk staff were just as friendly and obliging.Beyond the rooms, the layout was cozy, yet spacious, with areas for relaxing and dining and the meeting room that we used was quite adequate for our presentation, with a drop down projection screen, and plenty of outlets for use for projectors and laptops (which can be a problem for the business traveler.)The location was perfect, within walking distance of many great restaurants and the University of Charleston, and had the convenience of having a grocery store quite nearby.If you're looking for a ""full service hotel"", this may not be quite what you're looking for, as there's no pool, spa, gift shop, a relatively small fitness center, etc. but I highly recommend it, and would enjoy staying again when I visit Charleston again.spent two nights here to celebrate my girl's bday.  we loved it!  comfy room, lots of character, easy to walk everywhere in town.  good place to stay in charleston if you don't want to spend a fortune!Beautiful inn, huge gorgeous room, clean, clean, clean!  Can't say enough good things about this place.  Located on the edge of the historic arean, just 2 blocks from the city marke, the location is perfect.  Dozens of the city's best restaurants within a few blocks.  Prices are comparable to other hotels in the area, but why get a generic chain hotel room when you can get exposed bricks and beams, hundreds of old oil paintings, a gorgous paneled pub...charm galore.  Oh, and free parking!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/days-inn-charleston-historic-district-charleston,Days Inn Charleston Historic District,2.5,$$,46,"Just what I expected. Some have complained, but I don't understand how you could ask more of this place. Everything wasn't perfect but it was all acceptable. I also think a lot of the bad reviews are from before the remodel. And only a fool would waste time complaining about people walking past their window in a MOTEL... The good:The location couldn't be better. The famous Historic Charleston Market is a block away. Great shops like the Savanah Bee Company and River Street Sweets are around the corner. And one of the best breakfast spots in town, Toast of Charleston is attached to the motel. Get up early to avoid the lines, and check them out on Sunday for ""crazy hat day"". The parking is free, and if you get to town early like we did, they'll put you on a waiting list to check-in early when a room is available AND they go ahead and give you a parking pass so you can explore without paying to park elsewhere. The room had no signs of bugs (I always check for bed bugs), it was recently remodeled and very clean, with a couple of exceptions which I'll cover in ""the bad"". There is a safe in the room, so there's no excuse for complaining that your stuff came up missing like some people on here have. The front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful. The bad:The ice machines didn't work (at least not the two I found). The maid staff was being loud and cussing when we got there at 8:30am. Check-in is at 4pm... I should have paid more attention when booking, but I was a little disappointed. After doing a little research I found that the standard for the area is 3-4.  We were able to check-in early at 3pm, but knowing we were first on the list for early check-in made us think a room should have been available sooner. My wife and I have both held jobs working as maid staff in the past, and I know what it takes to clean a room and it shouldn't take more than 45 minutes for an experienced person who isn't wasting time with boisterous, vulgar conversations across the parking lot. Finally, for as long as it takes to get the rooms cleaned they really should be perfect, and they nearly were. The three things I found were 1) what looked like a coffee spill on the head corner of the box springs 2) a small amount of hair in the bath tub and 3) a few drops of urine on the toilet seat. The toilet issue should have been obvious, I'm not sure how it got overlooked. Overall we had a good experience, and I would probably stay here again if I were trying to stay on a budget.Pros: good location, parking, friendly front desk.Cons:  horrible comforter plagued with cigarette burns and blood, a broken lamp shade, a badly patched ceiling, holes in the shower curtain, and a small double bed that was elevated beyond belief. This room was a handicap room and it was not that handicap friendly due to stacked appliances on a fridge and no towel bars.Days Inn should upgrade their bedding first and foremost!  Stay other places if you can until management makes a change.It's a Days Inn. It's definitely not anything fancy, but it is in a fabulous location one block from Market Street or King Street.The beds are comfy. Temperature is controllable. Refrigerator and microwave in room.You might see a bug or two. Exterior corridors, and you can hear all of the noise from the street (any seasoned traveler comes equipped with earplugs anyway).No frills. You get what you pay for.Good, clean hotel in the middle of everything. It is older, but clean! Staff was so niceWHAT A GREAT LOCATION AND VALUE! This hotel could not be in a more convenient location. Walking distance to the Battery, King Street, Market Street, Bay Street, restaurants, museums, shops, coffeeshops, bars - basically EVERYTHING. And it's a great value. And the staff in the office were great, and the room was completely fine! I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Charleston and would recommend it to other pennypinchers, too!The night manager was not pleasant at all. Forget about southern hospitality. The only reason why we stayed because it was pet friendly,Very poor area to walk a dog.I was able to get a $70/night rate for a three day stay in late December on Priceline.The good:Staff were super niceEverything was reasonably cleanLocation was awesome, right off King StreetThe Ugly:Over three days, my room was only turned down onceTwo different times when I tried to shower, there was no hot water; several other times the water was borderline too hot. I never actually managed to get the tap adjusted to a comfortable temperatureMy shower drained slowly so by the end of each shower I was standing in ankle-deep water; I asked to have this addressed twice but didn't get much responseThe AC unit sounded like a very loud, static-y TV, to the point where I had trouble sleepingHalf the channels on the TV were actually static-yIf I had a slightly larger budget I would definitely stay somewhere else.Ignore most of the ratings of three stars or less.  I think these people don't understand that you get what you pay for.The Days Inn is all about location.  Yes, I too, was put in a smoker's room...and I wasn't a fan of how it smelled.  You know what else I'm not a fan of?  Spending $400 a night to stay in a nicer hotel that is close to all the action in Charleston.You'll get two beds, tv with cable, the regular amenities and a small pool to cool off in.  If you were looking for luxury around the $100 mark, you didn't do your homework on Charleston, and I'm guessing you're also a lousy tipper.Try:  Digging deeper and going elsewhere if you want luxury and comfort (this is a place to sleep)Avoid:  The smoking rooms if you canOk fellow Yelpers, here's what's up. If you're looking for a swanky southern style hotel that makes you feel like you've stepped back in time, this isn't it.  But let's be honest, would you really expect that for a Day's Inn?! This place is really good for what it is. Reasonably priced in a central location.  Staff could not be friendlier, and our room was clean, and parking is included. They're pet friendly (for a fee) but be sure to specify if you want a smoking or non smoking room. (I currently feel like I just walked in to my grandma's house while she's sitting on the couch watching the price is right going through her pack of cigs like they're going out of style)   Regardless, the hubby was a bit nervous about me being ok with staying here given my preference for places like Hotel Belleclaire in NYC and The Adolphus in Dallas but the location and price cannot be beat. Make yourself feel better by spending the money you saved by splurging at Poogan's Porch or the Gin Joint. You won't be disappointed.Thank God we only spent 90$ on priceline. The best part was the free parking, otherwise this place was a bust. Got there at 2:30pm, met by a rude front desk lady, said we couldn't ck in till 4 even though all the rooms were cleaned and this place was dead on a weekday and no holiday. Front desk said pool view room when in fact it was a view  of parking lot with semi and dumpster  parked in it. Beds had huge side rips and were on slants , with head higher than body which made for a horrible nights sleep. Huge black mold strips in tub, with ripped carpet and huge holes in walls. See pics. Spend the extra few bucks and stay elsewhere. But did enjoy Eli's table walking distance, great breakfast.Super helpful and friendly front desk. Great location. Good price.It's 2015, and this place still has smoking rooms. It's not clear when you book, what type of room you'll be getting. They run out of non-smoking rooms fast and the staff has to deal with tons of angry people that do not want to be in a gross room. All the staff will offer is a quick chemical spray to cover the smoke. Yuck. They like to give smoking rooms to people that reserve through Priceline and other sites, so be careful and call ahead to see what you can reserve. We had a dead roach in our room and mold in the bathroom. Check out is at 11am, we were hoping the front desk could be flexible and allow us to check out at noon so we could finish a tour. They said ""no"" and we had to check out at 11am. The location is great and the parking is free.Great service and room was very clean ! Pool was warm but dirty needs to be cleaned a bit more!If you stay here you are out of your mind.  Listen to the other reviews, I ignored them... Don't make my mistake!   This place is gross!   No parking!  Dirty!  Falling apart, stinky nasty rooms.   Worst hotel ever!  It should be a pay by the hour sex motel..that's how this place feels.  Don't be fooled by the looks of the place outside, seems like a nice enough hotel.. The inside is scary!Our motto this weekend became ""It could be worse."" Pros: friendly staffworking appliancesfree parking downtown locationfridge and microwave in the roomCons:Our room was a smoking one, no one asked us if we had a preference. And being that is was Labor Day weekend, it was too booked to switch. A constant water puddle next to our shower. Toilet didn't work so well. Hasn't been renovated for a few decades. Overall upkeep just wasn't good. I won't return if I can help it.First room we were put in had a floor that was soaking wet and overall reeked of mildew. My husband went and talked to the man at the desk and got our room switched. The new rooms blankets were stiff like cardboard and while my daughter was showering the water temperature suddenly changed, burned her and wouldn't cool down.. The only good thing is the location!As they say ..... you get what you pay for. Yes free parking but not enough parking spaces!!  Had to pay to park across street then they refund you when you check out. We paid for two nights but they checked us as being out the first night. Had to go to office and recheck in. Location was good but thats about all.You pay for what you get here, the location.  This hotel is steps away from everything in the historic district.  The room overall is fine, and has the standards of any cheap hotel room including a mini fridge, microwave, desk, TV, etc.  The bathroom light blew out which was a pain, but these things happen.  The things I did not like were the cracked and missing tiles in the bathroom, overly perfumed smell in the room, and the staff hanging around smoking in front of the office and near the stairwells every time we were outside, blocking the door and walkways and stinking up the place.  Also, at the time of this review, there was construction next door, so if you want to sleep in, you might be better off in another neighborhood.For us, it was fine for a night, but I would not book an entire week here.Awful place.  Smells like mold. Unfriendly service.  Holes in the sheets and comforter. The manager rude and could've cared less about our concerns. We moved hotels in five  minutesPerfection!! Inexpensive and awesomely located!!! I'm giving this spot 5 stars based on it being a motel, clean, perfect location, friendly staff and inexpensive!!!! Not really much else to say. I think they have a pool but can't really be sure. I can tell you that they are within walking walking distance of anything you might want to do in downtown historic Charleston!!","If you follow my reviews, you will note that I have just come back from an east coast road trip, that started in Florida (my Hometown) and ended in New York. My first stop, in Charleston, lead me to my stay at the Days Inn. The reason my friends and I booked this hotel was for the fairly low rates and location. The Days Inn was by far the largest hotel room on my trip. Although, it was perhaps the oldest and most outdated. But hey, that's just aesthetics, right? The rooms were clean. There was room enough for a Queen size bed and a desk with 2 chairs. The way the bathroom was situated, there was a sink outside of the toilet and shower area, allowing someone to shower and another to use the vanity area. This is a great feature, to prevent infringing on each other's privacy or fogging up the mirror. The towels were a little rough... Although, I am a bit of a linen snob (I design and sell custom yacht linens for a living).The location of this hotel is epic! I felt safe in the hotel.  And it was definitely within walking distance to King St. And all the local hot spots.All in all I think the Days Inn delivered exactly what you'd expect a Days Inn to deliver.If you want to be in a prime location for a reasonable price, then you really can't go wrong with this hotel.  If you're touring the downtown area, then most of your time will be outside instead of in your room, so it makes sense to save your money and stay at the Days Inn.Beware Room 122 the hellish stench in here goes so far beyond stench it's more like stank. The fetid aroma will haunt your dreams, forever. The location of the Hotel is in the heart of downtown making it an excellent base camp for exploring. Parking is tight so don't move your car or you'll lose your spot.Place is nice enough.  Our room was very quiet.  Came with a mini-frig, microwave, hairdrier, iron and board.  Beds were comfy. I would go back.  Location on Meeting Street is in the central hospitality area which is north of Broad Street.  The historical area south of Broad Street is residential only - no hotels, no retail.This place is a HUGE mistake. I'm not exaggerating. We stayed last year and got stuck in a smoking room-- filthy, stinking, disgusting. It didn't seem that they even cleaned it--blood was on the wall!!  We decided to try one more time because of the price and the location. I would rather sleep in my car. We got stuck with a handicap room this year complete with a gross, dirty handicap shower chair.  It is musty, dead bugs, hair in the sheets. I swear they don't clean these rooms.  And don't bother complaining to the staff. They are the worst, most unfriendly people I've ever met. I really don't know how anyone could rate this place well at all.  If I could give this a negative review I would. This place is just taking advantage of tourists.The only thing good about this hotel is the location. The bathroom had tiles missing off of the floor, the stairs up to the second floor were loose, and the door had a quarter inch gap under it. Every closing door nearby could be heard. The air conditioner had a rattle in it. Lifting up a magazine off of the desk revealed some kind of bug living under it.Traveling with pets? Non-smoker? This is not the place to go. I booked this hotel through their website, which listed the hotel as pet friendly. Getting there, it turns out that the only rooms they allow pets in are smoking rooms, which I cannot stay in due to health reasons. A $100 fee is charged if pets stay in a non-smoking room.Great access to historic downtown Charleston is not worth sleepless nights and extra fees.Very old hotel, the staff is not the greatest, but is great for the price. The location is nearly unbeatable.The place was actually a little nicer than I was expecting based on reviews. The rooms open to the outside (instead of an interior hallway) but the neighborhood seems safe so I guess it could be worse. The pool looks okay, though I didn't use it. The place didn't have complimentary breakfast and didn't have a fitness center, but the free wifi and parking were more important to me. The wifi was reliable and fast enough- something that's often an issue in budget hotels. Like everyone else says, the location can't really be beat. It's in the heart of tourist areas and the best restaurants/bars. I stayed here for three nights and never needed a car.The room itself was hit or miss. The pillows and sheets were very clean and new, but the blanket/comforter had burns and stains on it. The shower and toilet were very clean but the bathroom door frame and baseboards by the sink were dirty/damaged and needed to be replaced. Bottom line is that the place was clean enough, has a great location and the best price in the historic district.Location!  Location!  Location!  That is the best thing about this hotel.  It's a short walk to The Market area.  They are dog friendly, but you must make that clear when you reserve the room because only certain rooms are for dogs.  The rooms were.... old and basic.  They were pretty clean though, which I appreciate.  If proximity and price is a high priority, I'd recommend it, if not go somewhere else.We stayed in May, the place is old but clean and a great location. It had free parking, a good air conditioner and we could walk everywhere down town. If you want to save some money and don't have to be in a big name property then this is the place.Oh yuck. Since when did Days Inn get so crappy? The place was clean. The overwhelming smell of bleach doesn't let you forget! The bathroom needs some serious repairs. The shower head was low and there were rust stains in the tub and some of the knobs didn't work. It's been 3 months and no beg bugs have surfaced in my home from my trip - always a good sign - although I did spray my bedbug spray around the beds. I do that everywhere nowadays.The housekeeping and front desk staff get 5 stars but the room gets 2. The location cant be beat. It's right in the middle of all the best places to see and it's probably the cheapest place but the worst value.Excellent customer service.  The people at the front desk were so friendly and helpful and the maids too. The rooms were a bit outdated and there was no storage under the sink,  just a fake cabinet door to make it look like there was.  Wallpaper coming off on the bathroom.  But great location and one of the cheaper hotels on the historic districtAlright folks. When reviewing this hotel, I'm going to keep in mind it's obvioulsy not in the same caliber as a BnB, a Hilton, or Marriot. This is a DAYS INN. With that said, it's the best hotel deal in the city. When you arrive, you get a parking pass, you can actually find a parking spot, and you won't need to move your car 'til you go back home because the location is amazing! The bed is fine, the bathroom is clean, you get a medium size fridge, microwave, ice bucket/cups, and coffee pot. NO WI-FI, that I found anyways. If you plan to stay in your room the entire trip, then yes, book at the Four Seasons. But I'd rather save that extra $150/ night to use on the amazing FOOD and TOURS Charleston has to offer! Who cares about where I lay my head for 8 hours! We were able to walk to the City Market, Cru Cafe (make RSVPs!), Husk (make RSVPs well in advance), Poogan's Porch. We walked to the Battery, the bars on Bay (Gin Joint, Social Wine, The Squeeze Bar).OLD!  Uncomfortable small beds.  Missing tiles and hole in bathroom wall.  Outside noise will keep you from sleep.  Carpet looks original therefore SCARY!  Location is great.Stay here if you go to Charleston.  The hotel is in the middle of historic area and close by everything.  It helps when you plan to walk around a lot and want to crash at the hotel after you're done.  The room was nice and clean.  It was affordable as well.  It's not cheap to stay in the area, but we saved staying here when we did our research.If you are looking to visit Charleston and experience a great city and are on a budget...this is the place to stay. I wouldn't typically stay at a Days Inn but you can't beat this location at this price. My wife and I came here for a long weekend and originally booked and stayed about 15 miles away in a nicer and less expensive hotel. However, we were never in our room and each day found ourselves driving to downtown and having to go through the struggle of where to park and how much and how far away and ugh! We walked by the Days Inn and thought why aren't we staying there? It's not  the 4 Star Wyndham we were at but it's right where we want to be. No parking/travel/traffic battle. We checked out of the 4 star ($100) Wyndham that was 15 miles away and checked into the 2 star ($149) Days Inn the next day. The room is fine. It's a little smaller and not as nice, the air-conditioner makes a little noise, the bathroom is smaller, etc.. We can live with all these things. The room doesn't stink, I can't stand the smell of smoke and I don't smell any. The bed is comfortable. The people in the office are nice. But here is the thing...the parking is free and available!!! The hotel is right off of Market Street in downtown!!! One block from King Street. Easily walking distance to Waterfront Park and The Battery/White Point Gardens. Walking distance to all kinds of great restaurants, shops, bars, crazy cool houses, and just a really cool city. This hotel provides everything we are looking for during our stay and very little of it involves the inside of a hotel room. If it was dirty, if there were bugs, if it was loud, or unsafe...I wouldn't recommend. But I can't say any of that. What I can say is unless you're rich and can afford the 5 star hotels in downtown...stay at Days Inn off Meeting Street.No one smiles here at all.  The bathroom had mold and stuff in the bathtub.  Around caulking.  Out of date.   Still have bed spreads on beds.   Threw on floor pronto.  The females at front desk seemed as though we were a bother to them.   They say have a nice day to end the conversation for you.   No smile.I wouldn't stay here again, even though it is much, much less expensive than any other hotel in the historic area, and even though it has one of the most convenient locations in the city.The room was dated and had lots of stains; you had to hold down on the flusher to make the water in the toilet go down; and there were lots of bugs in the room. I didn't find the staff to be particularly helpful.A cockroach crawled out of my travel companion's suitcase when he got back home, and I think I got bed bugs from this place. I travel often and it's the grossest room I've been in. I don't understand how a hotel could be this bad.A quality no frills hotel to lay your head when visiting this awesome city.  It's cheap and has a stellar location and free parking.  The rooms may be a little small for a family of 4, but that's the only downside I can see.  They also appeared to be renovating bathrooms when I was there.  When you're in Charleston you should be spending as little time in your hotel room as possible, so why spend a fortune on it?Avoid this places at all costs. Our room was like a dungeon, the sun never reached our windows, the whole place smelled of mildew, and everything was damp. The wallpaper was peeling off the wall and sheets had seen better days. The staff were helpful once you can get past the fact that they are rude by nature for having to work at such a bad hotel. Needless to say, we will not be returning.","Awful. I booked a stay here two months early and received a confirmation email. When I called the week before my trip, apparently there was something wrong with my card number and it was cancelled. I didn't receive any notification as such and they were all booked up by this time.We got bed bugs here. The hotel, as well as The Days Inn corporate office refuse to refund our money even though we ruined hundreds of dollars in clothes and luggage. This place is a great location with free parking, but it's FILTHY. It's just not worth itThis is a great option for visiting Charleston.  Its clean, cheap, and very close to all of the historic sites.  There is a nice pool and you can park very close to your room.This hotel, conveniently located in the center of historic Charleston (and with a free parking lot), has suffered the slings and arrows of many customers who were repelled by its shabbiness. I have good news. The motel has been cleaned and upgraded and is a true bargain. It you think of it, not as a low end hotel, but rather as a high end hostel, you will enjoy your stay. Rooms are small and efficient but clean and comfortable. In fact, after three weeks of travel, sleeping in many different rooms, I found the Days Inn pillow to be the only one that fit perfectly between my cheek and shoulder. Everywhere else I traveled, I had to choose between  using one pillow (too thin) or two (too thick) with the resulting neck pain. The desk attendant here, when we arrived around midnight, was courteous and helpful (the lot being full, she allowed us to park in a ""handicapped"" space no one else would have used). Rooms have refrigerator and microwave, adequate lighting, and room for luggage. The TV has HBO and msnbc included in a long list of regular and cable channels. Ask for a non-smoking room, as some rooms do allow for smoking. And if you want art on your hotel walls, bring your own.I wish I could give this place a zero.  This is probably one of the worst hotel I have stayed in.  The room are dark and dingy, and some even still have the dorrs between rooms that make it so you can hear every move made by the people in the next room.  The staff in the office is aloof and not freindly, lackadaisical comes to mind.  To add insult to injury, I had a death in the family the day we arrived and I am from RIchmond, VA.  We needed to leave the next morning in order to be back for the funeral.  I made the front desk aware of this at check in and was told I needed to contact the third party site I booked through in order to gain a refund for the second night I have already booked.  Fine.  No problem.  I did.By the time I contacted the third party site, they had alredy made payment to Days Inn and the refund process would be completely up to them.  So I called them back.  Each time I called I got a non chalant individual on the other end of the line stating that it wasnt' their responsibility and they couldn't help me.  No ""let me see if I can call someone"", no ""let me see what I can do"", and not even an ""I am sorry I am unable to refund your night's stay and I am very sorry for your loss.""  I will never stay in this hotel again, and I am going back this summer.  In addition, I will probably never stay at a Days Inn again.  I just can't get past the total lack of interest in customer service or the satisfaction of their guests.",,,"['expected', 'complained', 'understand', 'ask', 'place', 'everything', 'perfect',

The hotel was not that nice to begin with when I arrived, but before I left it was even worst. I was in town on business and decided to stay here because I get a discount at La Quinta hotels. I could have paid a little more and stayed some place nicer; I did love the location on the marina with California Dreaming in walking distance from the hotel. The first night was ok; check-in when smoothly, got to my room and it seemed clean until I let down the spread and there was makeup on the sheets, and the bed was very uncomfortable. Anyway I get up the next morning and they do have a meager breakfast buffet with waffles, coffee, cereal, boiled eggs, and bread; nothing really extravagant. So I go to work and come back really tired from not getting much sleep the night before to find that the hotel is flooded. I go up to my room and it is actually raining in my room from a busted boiler they have on the roof; luckily none of my belongings were destroyed. The hotel did move me to a new room which was in their other building this a building with the rooms on the outside of the hotel, no big deal; except you can hear everyone walking by and every car and boat driving by. The next morning I was very happy checking out. I've got to come back to Charleston this week and I think I'll stick to the Hampton Inn instead; it's only $20 more a night without a discount.Two letters. N-O. Please do yourself a huge favor and stay at a different hotel, even if it costs an additional $5-$10. (I wish I could give zero stars on this) First, this hotel has two buildings, the one the show on their website and the one they don't. The other one is outside, and believe me, you know it. You hear cars, marina crew, intoxicated guests at the same hotel, everything. It does not make for a plesant slumber. As for the room, it's small, damp and looks (and smells) in desperate need of a cleaning. The room we stayed in, did not even have a telephone! It also didn't have a trash can, and only one set of towels, with the washcloth already looking rather used. I used my phone to call the front desk to explain and the lady just laughed and said ""you ain't got no phone?! That's crazy"" (still, they never brought one). In addition, the bath tub bottom was stained black, the mirror had stains/marks all over it and our lampshade looked like it lost a few battles. The desk chair, if you want to call it that, looked like a beach chair with wheels and it was too wide so you couldn't walk past it, you had to move it completely out of the way. It is a poorly planned hotel with completely outdated items. Also, you can't access their wi-fi and when I called about that, they couldn't tell me what to do. Positives: free breakfast and a shuttle to downtown every 2 hours - but make sure you call because sometimes they forget. Overall: please do yourself a favor and choose a different hotel. There are many others and ones that are pet friendly as well.Made a reservation not knowing the hotel, they offered a river view, what a joke not worth the additional cost could barely see the river.  Checked into room the bath tub was filthy and hairs from the previous occupants all over the tub and floor, called front desk they said they would send someone to clean it there was also only one towel in the room, we waited 20 minutes nobody came to clean the bathroom we asked to change rooms we had to go back to the desk they had such a care less attitude it was insulting. In the second room, the phone did not work and the ice machine on the first floor (where the room was) also did not work, had to go to the third floor for ice.  The pillows were no at all comfortable.  The hotel overall is filthy, elevators, floors, walls.We checked in late, otherwise I would not have stayed here, but for sure never will again.If I could give a lower score I would. Hair in the bed, leaky faucet, horrific beds, slow elevators, sorry maintenance staff, rude breakfast staff, etc. I will never go to another La Quinta again after this experience.Pro: close to charleston, good view on harbor, free shuttle every 2 hours to charlestonCons: old sock under bed sheets, dirty shower, not enough towels, weird smell, mediocre service, construction going during stay, crappy roomI will look for something different the next time (i have no idea how that place could have gotten 3 stars on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>)This place needs to get rid of every human working there and start with a clean slate. The worst staff ever. My bathroom didn't have a shower curtain up, so I ask the cleaning lady to get me one, she never came back......2 hours later I went down to tell the front desk that I didn't have one. They finally got me one and I put it up myself. Oh - and the lady that runs the breakfast area is the RUDDIEST person that I have ever encounter. She lacks a lot in the friendly department. She should be the first one to go.THIS PLACE IS A DUMP.  I spent four days here and in the most squalid conditons.  I arrived late and was given a room in a separate building of the hotel to the back.  I got there and the room door was propped open, the curtains closed, and the room was dark.  Decided I did not want to subject myself to risk by going in with all my stuff.  The desk agent at 1a.m. was very rude(first name starts with T).  She transferred me to another room.  I had to grab all my stuff and carry it up stairs to the main landing where the elevator is.  When I got to my room on the opposite side of the building and a different floor I saw the room did not have curtains on the 6 fot by 5 foot windows. I called desk and when I asked T to please do something about this she hung up.I travel a lot on business and have been to other La Quintas.  Nothing prepared me for this place.  Socks, broken furniture, and soda cans littered the walkways from my room. The pain was chipped and peeling.  My room looked like it hadn't been renovated in 10 years.  It had a weird chemical smell.  I could go on but you get the idea.  NEVER AGAIN!To start things off, the first morning we jump in the shower and get out to realize we don't have any towels in the room. It then took the hotel staff an additional 20 minutes to bring them.That night we come back, we find out someone apparently checked us out of our hotel room a day early so when we can't back to our room the room keys didn't work.The room clearly wasn't cleaned properly- there was hair still in the shower and coffee stirs on the floor.To top it all off, when we went to check out we realized we were way overcharged for our second nights stay. In our confirmation email (and what they quoted us) stated $95 and they charged us $188. They did refund us the difference but it was a total inconveince. That has NEVER happened to us at any other La Quinta.Oh, and the yogurt at breakfast had expired two days before and I'm pretty sure my milk in my cereal was bad. Our next trip to Charleston, we will definitely be finding somewhere else to say. That says a lot considering we're members of La Quinta.Arrived at 10:30pm on a Thursday night with 9 people, and 3 dogs. Reserved 3 rooms 30 minutes prior after a catastrophe at the hotel we booked months ago that was absolutely disgusting. Everything seemed great, lobby was pretty, staff is nice, pets allowed with no fees. Then my husband and I get to our room and the floor is soaking wet as well as both beds, the phone doesn't work to call downstairs so we decide to take the elevator down. The elevator got stuck and they didn't even attempt to help us get out. My husband pried the door open and we stepped up about 2 feet and out of the elevator (sweating). Got to the lobby then didn't seem to bat an eye when we told them we were the ones that were stuck. We told them about the wet floors and they switched our room. Stepped into the new room, light didn't work right off the bat. Fast forward 1 hour, we get into one of the beds and the sheets are stained with brown/red splattered spots (barf). We slept in the other double (all the beds are full size) bed. All in all, this is one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at and its the 2nd one I've tried in Charleston in one night. I'm so annoyed I want to stop my vacation and circle back home to my clean, dry, splatter free bed. Rant over.There are two sections to the hotel, an older part and a newer part. My review covers the older section.I have a tendency to stay at La Quintas when traveling with one of my four footed friends. This one was by the far the worst I have seen. The furniture looked like it had been around since the 70's..scratched and torn. The carpet was so worn it was bare in spots. The room smelt of dust and I had to go out and by air freshener to make it tolerable. I had to ask for amenities like a waste basket. There are no trash cans outside the older section and access to the rooms is from the outdoors. There is an elevator but it was broken the whole 3 days I was there. Contrary to what another review I never heard any barking dogs but there was the flashing light from the marina that was on all night. They didn't change out the dirty towels... the towel for the bath mat was torn. The bed had a huge indentation in it ... the tub was dirty and the hairdryer was covered in dirt. I could keep going on... There was dust an inch thick on the night table. If I could have changed hotels I would have. I did have to use the facilities in the main hotel lobby -- there were paper towels all over the floor and I had to ask for toilet paper. Disgusting ...RUN.... GET OUT OF THERE...You're not leaving...  Fine...  But remember, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED ! ! ! After my ONE STAR experience with a La Quinta in Savannah GA, you'd think I'd abandon the idea of returning to another La Quinta location.  You thought wrong... I didn't have that much of a choice but yeah, here we are back at another La Quinta.A few hours before arriving in Charleston SC, we were using the mobile phone to find hotel;  not as easy as I thought it would be, plus we didn't really know the area (first time visiting).  Our goal was to locate a hotel in or near the historic district.  Most were filled to capacity and those that had vacancy were insanely expensive.  I found a La Quinta just over the Ashley River (still very close to everything).  SUCK IT UP GLENN, HOW BAD CAN IT BE?Well, I sucked it up, bite the bullet and reserved a room (a room with one king bed)The hotel looked like any other on the outside;  a lovely marina view for the rooms on the front side of the building and highway for those facing the back of building.  Entering the building was ehh;  kinda dated and in need of modernization but not bad enough for us to run (yet).  We check in and naturally we request a marina view.  She apologized she couldn't accommodate that request because they are full.  No problem since we were last minute.  We head to the room and turns out we DO have a marina view, but what we don't have is a king sized bed... nope, we have two separate small beds.  I head back to the front desk and request a room change to a king bed.  She says they have no vacancies and certainly no more king beds.  Ridiculous.Things aren't ONE STAR levels yet but after our night out in town we returned to our room with two little beds.  I stay up quite late and it wasn't until 3 in the morning that I decided to finally climb into bed.  The room was dimly lit from the television and I barely notice something on the pillow next to me... WHAT IS THAT?  I don't really want to know but human nature go the best of me and I turn on a light.. OMG it's blood spots (or at least that's what it looked like).  Oh NASEAU... I didn't complain to the front desk because I was furious and it was 3 am but I should have known better to stay away from La Quinta.  Just like my Savannah GA visit, I checked out early and called that 800 number.  They offered the same resolve as in GA (a voucher for a free night).  NO WAY, NEVER, AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN... GIVE ME MY MONEY... THIS PLACE WAS DISGUSTING.You can read about my Savannah GA experience here:   <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-savannah-midtown-savannah#hrid:VEdICeKNvhJUGGpuzuE_Tw/src:self"">yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-i...</a>The biggest issue that we had with the hotel....only 3 towels and 1 washcloth for 4 people is ridiculous.  We asked housekeeping numerous times and her only answer was that washcloths were a hot commodity. I'm not cool with sharing linens. Oh, only got one bar of soap...not enough with 2 adults and a teenage that loves to take showers. Other issue, every evening we would come back to the room, our ac was switched to heat. In Charleston in July..... Location was just fine.Great location but one can do a lot better. On the plus side, The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were just right. On the negative side, moldy bathtub and bathroom. Inattentive front desk and maintenance service. Small, dingy room with a tiny window whose view of the river was forever blocked by the fog from the air conditioner and the dirty windows. Breakfast was mediocre. Best bet is to stay at the Holiday Inn Express directly across from this hotel. One last item, did I say no hot water? Took showers early in the afternoon and in the evening and the water was tepid at best.This place is dirty. I don't dare touch anything. Hoping the interior sheets are safe.I should have known better after staying one night in a LaQuinta in Columbus, GA years ago. Staff acted like I was a bother to them when I checked in. Our room was acceptable but could have used more soap and wash cloths. Beds were comfortable and the view of the harbor was nice through a sweaty and dirty window. Go elsewhere.In retrospect, I would pay a bit more so that I could be closer to the downtown area.  This place is across the bridge from the city.  It isn't too long of a drive, but my time in Charleston would have been twice as nice had I been down where everything is.Speaking of location, upon check-in, make sure that you are not down at the west end, near the boat storage place.  The walls are thin, and the doors have gaps, so they let in a lot of sound.  A LOT!  That boat place opens up very early and they start running their machinery.  It will make tons of noise, and sometimes vibrate your room.  You've been warned. This hotel has certainly seen better days.  It is a bit rundown.  The ice machines are giant, gurgling antiques and the washers and dryers are boxy, white scratch &amp; dent specials from god knows where.  On a pleasant note, the staff seems to be very friendly, and while the place is worn down, it does appear to be clean and looked after.  No complaints about what's inside the room.  Nice tv, strong wi-fi, comfy beds, and good water pressure.Jessica the lady at the front desk was very nice. That's why this place is getting an additional star. From her alone. She deserves a raise. From outside, the hotel looks nice. Inside is a different story. It is a bit outdated. Once we walked into our room, it felt dirty. And sure enough it kinda was. For four people there was one trash can, three shower towels, and no refrigerator. The bathroom needs to be redone. It too was dirty. But what did I expect? I did get a room for $84 per night with only an 8 minute drive to Charleston.The gm of the hotel ultimately refunded my night's stay (didn't ask for that) and did his best to address my concerns. While my stay was still not pleasant, I still appreciate him taking the time to listen and respond.This hotel is ok. The rooms are a good size and ours was clean and did not smell. They did not clean it the next day, but cleaned it the day after that. We had to get towels at one point as we did not have enough. The pool was closed for 2 days for some reason. There is plenty of parking in the back and on the side.Like all La Quinta this hotel is dog friendly. That's the only perk. I have been Working in hotel consumer service for almost ten years  in the napa valley and I cannot even fathom how unprofessional and rude the staff is here. And if you're looking for a clean room and quiet nights sleep and that doesn't smell of pee, then forget about it. Every time I pass the front desk they are arguing with a guest. Did I mention an employee tried coming into my room when I wearing nothing but a towel? luckily I had the flip latch on the door because the ""do not disturb"" sign and the pad lock weren't enough. Oh it gets worse. After calling the front desk and trying to explain what had happen she starting talking on her radio while I was mid sentence. And it gets better..She had the decency to tell me that it was my fault. If that wasn't the icing on the cake, they scheduled us to check out a day early.. They again told us that it was our fault. My family are members of la Quinta and Marriott... However, while in Charleston we will no longer waste a dime here and I encourage everyone to bring their business elsewhere.","I originally chose the La Quinta as we hoped to bring our dogs along with us on our trip. After reading reviews we saw several that said the hotel will call you immediately if your dog barks in the room. We got spooked as our dog barks during storms and it was supposed to storm all weekend. We stayed at La Quinta Pup-less...and the moment you walk in it sounds like a kennel. Doesn't bother us at all but seriously one dog didn't stop barking for two days and I didn't see or hear about any consequences.We were pleasantly surprised at the look of our room and bathroom. For the cost it was very nice and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and stocked with all the necessary toiletries. The next day our room was ""serviced"" but the bed was left unmade and the bathroom was not restocked or cleaned. It's as if someone started to clean it, left to get something and forgot to come back. Not a problem, but would've been nice to have a clean room.The complimentary breakfast was fine. If you like waffles you will be pleased, you could also choose bagels, donuts or cereal.I would stay at this La Quinta again if I was on a budget or wanted to bring my dogs.I have stayed at this hotel a few times because it is what I was awarded through a name your own price. For that price, I cannot truly complain; however, for that same price, I have stayed in many other places in the Charleston area for a much better experience. This LaQuinta Inn is dirty and could stand a deep clean. i feel it stands behind a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy. The one thing it has going for it is that it is just around the corner from down town and the service is friendly....just don't ask for much.Staying here to board a cruise the following day in Charleston and this hotel is very convenient. They offer free parking for cruisers while they cruise which is key. Hotel staff was very accommodating at arrival and answered any questions I had during my stay. Hotel overall is in decent shape, it's not the Ritz but overall I would stay here or recommend it to others. Rooms are clean along with free breakfast and wifi is nice. Just could use some updating.I don't think this La Quinta is as bad as some people have said.  It's maybe not as modern as some of the other ones, but I felt fortunate to get a room so last minute and a few minutes cab ride from downtown Charleston.  And our room was not dirty, so maybe that was a past housekeeping issue that has since been resolved.   I thought the harbor view was really nice, both in the day and at night.  So if you can, you will probably want to ask for the harbor view room facing the marina. The beds are nice too, soft and comfy.  The room we were in was roomy as well.  The only thing I didn't get was that the sink was in the bathroom along with the coffee pot and I wondered if poopy germs would get in my coffee in the morning.  But I made coffee in there and I survived so I guess it wasn't a big deal.  The room also had a nice bureau in it too so we could hang up all our clothes and coats, and that was nice.  It's also very convenient that they have a washer/dryer in the hotel and are reasonably priced.Perhaps some expect the ritziness of Charleston at economy level prices and that's just not going to happen at a budget hotel.  But like almost everyone we met in Charleston, folks were very nice and polite here and like every La Quinta they were very cool with our dog.  They didn't care about the breed, or weight limits or anything.  Overall it was a nice stay and I'd stay here again.Room small and very dirty.  Booked for a family of 5.  Got a room with two double beds and not enough room for a roll away.Half a used condom wrapper in the bathroom.  Pubes on the toilet.  Comforter filthy with stains.  Fire ants outside.Generally the whole place looks run down and dirty.Very bland and dated hotel. Great location next to the marina. A lot of water damage in the bathroom. Breakfast shut down completely at 1030am. Not even coffee Overall not bad but could use some updating and more pleasant decor very ""dorm"" like and cold in lobby.Checked into a king non-smoking room and immediately noticed that it smelled musty. The wardrobe that was provided smelled so bad that I would not hang my clothes up in it, or iron my clothes with the iron stored in there, for fear that it would cause them to smell. The carpet felt damp, the bed felt damp, and the bathroom did not have an exhaust fan to help with the moisture. Even papers that we left out on the nightstand overnight felt damp in the morning. I have no idea what the problem could have been, but I'm not sure how housekeeping did not notice it. We even sprayed the air freshener from the car multiple times to try to hide the smell. For the money, I could easily find somewhere else that does not have a moisture and smell problem. I have always had good experiences with La Quinta in the past, not sure what is going on with this location.Great location, rooms clean, great parking area, staff very helpfulI would give zero stars if I could. My 'executive king' room stank heavily (as in, overwhelmingly) of stale cigarettes and cheap chemical to (attempt to) mask it. Stains on the floor. Dog barking incessantly in the room next door. Noisy traffic from the adjacent interstate. A pubic hair (not mine) on the toilet upon my arrival. This place should be an hourly rental and nothing more. Disgusting.In the past, I worked for more than a decade in the service industry (waiting tables, customer service, etc.), so I'm loathe to complain.  Never have I asked to switch rooms and I've never sent back food in a restaurant.  But I did insist on leaving this hotel at 9pm after checking in, and it took some effort to find a vacancy in town seeing as how it's spring break.  But it was entirely worth the effort.  I was not going to stay there.  No way.  No how.The only redeeming quality of this hotel is that they allowed me to check out without penalty (I think).  Regardless, this was my first and last time staying at a La Quinta.This is not representative of La Quinta or Choice Hotels. My wife and I love to take our dog to Ka Quintas wherever we go, always knowing that our time there will be flawless, and the rooms clean. Here, there were bugs, my room keys never worked, the TV was broke, the a/c made loud sporadic noises, there was no room fridge or bathroom trash can (something I've seen at every La Quinta). The hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful, however they were waaaay overworked for the amount of people this hotel services at once. The hotel has potential to straighten up and shine, but that would require all new management.Pool is small but it is pet friendly and you can walk by the marina and look at the gorgeous boats.  Free breakfast is surprisingly nice!!! Only 2 complaints:  room service did not get to our room until almost dinner and our room had a smoking smell to it- like someone had been smoking in there :( Other than that all was fine.I'm gonna warn those who use Travelocity, don't expect to get what you pay for.  However, when we arrived on August 29th, Mary at the front desk of La Quinta worked out the errors that Travelocity made with our booking and made me very happy.  And she didn't have to.  I really appreciate her!  Thank you Mary!  The weekend was my birthday and our anniversary and I for one, like La Quinta and enjoyed staying in this one in Charleston.  It was nice, a clean room and quiet.  Only heard dogs if and when I walked down the hall and it was only briefly.  But I'm a dog person and that's okay.  I would recommend you stay here.  Easy to get anywhere in Charleston and reasonable.Ok booked this online, I am a loyal LQ customer as we stayed in them all of the way from Seattle during our relocation. we have 2 small dogs and I hate being charged for them. PRO: Convenience, price (gov rate, AAA), location to area, breakfast is decent, but they need to have some biscuits and gravy to change it up, we were here 5 days every day is waffles. Parking is huge we had 3 vehicles one of which had an RV attached no issues. California Dreaming is just down the street (recommend). Linens are very clean and smell like bleach.CON: This is an old property (former Hampton) and they are slooooowly bringing it up to LQ standards. We had numerous issues, all resolved but it took 3 days, the sense of urgency by staff to correct any issues is greatly lacking ( I had to threaten to take my business else where) The night manager feels her only job is to stand there and eat popcorn while you are explaining the issue at hand. And then it is a shrug or ""I came on at 3 so I do not know"" attitude. Our shower did not drain for 2 days the card reader to get in the room was not unlocking ( still and on day 3). We asked for a fridge and microwave which was brought up the next day thanks to the day manager. Rooms are dingy with old furniture.All in all I think if LQ put $$$ into this property it would be a great place to stay.This was the dirtiest, ugliest place I've been to in a very long time.  I couldn't wait to get out of there.Worst hotel experience of my life. Our room was next to the checkin with no door separating the hallway. When I tried to close it they gave me some bs about fire doors. The lerk shouted all night on the speaker phone and made sitting in the room miserable. The clerk could care less. We were greeted by a loud Machine outside our door very noisy drying out some kind of water spill on the carpet. Shower musty and moldy. Constant screaming from breakfast area. Great view of a parked car. Whoever designs these places must be a Cretan. This place is not fit for human habitation and should be demolished.If you are a light sleeper avoid this place, was not impressed at all. Should have read the reviews on Yelp before I bookedI've stayed here for years because it is affordable, convienently located and pet friendly. The accomodations are fine for a trip where you spend little time in the room, but they are nothing to write home about. I stay here at least two to three times a year when visiting Charleston. It is usually a good value for what you receive; the breakfast is nice and the TVs in the room are as well. My biggest issue with this hotel is the staff. They are rude and not helpful. Most recently, we booked a room with two beds and a sofa through a third party. Upon arrival our room did not have a sofa bed and the staff at the front desk, who is responsible for providing room information to third parties, did nothing, despite the fact that we had one person, with no where to sleep. They also complained about noise in our room. For a hotel with so many reviews about volume, they are sure quick to come knock on your door with a noise complaint, for really no reason at all. Additionally, I had my dog with me on my last trip and we stayed on the first floor. I went outside to get a bag from the car in the middle of the day, and before I was even to the vehicle the front desk was calling my cell phone to tell me that my dog was barking. I had been gone for approximately 2 minutes before they called and rudely demanded that I come back from wherever I was.Only stay here if you are planning to spend very little time actually in the room. It isn't worth the hassle.This place is F-ing disgusting and the manager is incompetent. You get what you pay for, but its not worth more than $60/night.Rooms are just okay as the bathrooms are outdated and the beds are somewhat old and worn. While we were there I saw a new set of mattresses delivered so maybe they are updating everything. The bellhop was a really nice man and helped us bring in our luggage and saw that we had food so he brought a mini fridge in. Staff was friendly and the continental breakfast was standard. The best thing about this place is the close proximity to downtown and the fact that its in a very quiet road which has little traffic. I would come back down here for the location if for nothing elseThis hotel was okay.  It was clean and convenient to area attractions.  The staff is friendly and accomodating.  It had all the amenities that we needed to make our stay comfortable.  There were a few things that bothered me about this hotel.  It's very dog friendly, which I don't mind, but we ended up with a room next to an constant barker.  We also found the internet to be extremely unreliable.  The continental breakfast is good but gets very crowded.  For such a basic room, I found it to be expensive.","Gross. I really wish I had read the Yelp reviews before my boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel. The room was very outdated, which isn't very appealing, but that wouldn't have bothered me that much if it wasn't dirty! The bed skirt was stained along with the ottoman, and the couch. No microwave and no fridge. Which was a complete inconvenient. The bathroom looked moldy and dirty. The wallpaper looked grimy. But, what threw me off the edge was the GIANT water-bug in our room. The thing was the size of a golf ball, and I swear there were more than one. I understand that the hotel is near a marina, but I don't think that's an excuse. I'm pretty sure other hotels exterminate so bugs like that won't get in, but apparently not La Quinta. My boyfriend spent almost 10 minutes hunting the thing down to kill it as I shirked of disgust in the corner. I could barely sleep thinking another one would crawl into our bed in the middle of the night. I would NEVER stay at this hotel again in my life. It's not even THAT close to Folly Beach. Worst of all, this hotel is NOT cheap. For that one night we whipped out $155 dollars. Urgh.We originally booked to stay here for three nights and the first morning couldn't have come soon enough. We took our things and headed to another hotel. One of my worst hotel experiences ever! Room was VERY worn and not clean at all and for some reason when we showered water spilled out all over the floor making it dangerous to get out for fear of falling. The linens were faded and shabby and the bed was horribly uncomfortable. The room was not very clean at all either. I found hair everywhere. We were renting two rooms next to each other for our family.We were put outside at the adjoining building of the hotel.  Our boys had a drunk man banging on their window in the middle of the night and then all night long someone in one of the rooms had a yapping dog. Also at different intervals all night long people would go out on the terrace and yell for people down in the parking lot. My entire family could not wait to get out of this place. I spent the evening there searching online for other places to stay. When I called the desk at La Quinta to complain they acted like they could care less and offered nothing to help make my stay more comfortable. Never again!This La Quinta is in a nice location on a dead-end road, by a marina  across from Charleston. Easy to get into town and within walking distance of California Dreaming, a nice restaurant located in an old fort (hint: try the Bloody Marys). Some of the rooms in the hotel have nice water views and the staff is welcoming and helpful.Great hotel, nice staff, good breakfast.  What more do you need?  Clean rooms, nice views... This La Quinta has it all.  Very happy.Not bad.  Somewhat overpriced because of its location. Staff were all extremely courteous and professional.  Room was very clean.  The only complaints were that the bathroom lighting was inadequate and the  continental breakfast was, at best, so so.  The only protein was in the improperly over-boiled eggs.Walls are paper thin, you can hear someone cough or someones tv/radio on low! Rooms are mostly clean, the bathroom shower/tub was dirty/stained. I stood on a towel in the tub so I didn't get any foot fungi or anything. Parking is kinda limited as well. I'd try to find a better place to stay.Never have I seen so many dogs in a hotel. Easily a dozen. Bedspread stained. Desk clerk friendly.Checked in to a room on the 4th floor with a nice view of the Marina but the room was worn and musky.  The loud AC had to work all night to keep the room cool and the bed was old and scratchy.  The worst of the La Qunita's we've stayed in this past week.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-charleston-airport-conv-ctr-north-charleston-3,Crowne Plaza Charleston Airport - Conv Ctr,3.5,$$,25,"Great stay. Beautiful and spacious rooms. Close to Tanger Outlet and and fairly close to the interstate. About 10 minutes from US 17 and 20 minutes from Folly Beach.  Great sleeping bed, ample free parking. No complaints.the rooms aren't awful but the shower takes forever to get hot and has one of them 2 turn diverters from the 1960s. Pain in the ...... to set.The shower curtain bar was updated to the bow variety, but they used the old curtain from a straight bar, so it comes up a foot short on either side.Nice and helpful staff.  OK, pricy restaurant, for what it is.Atrium set up with an active late nite bar full of loud mouth drunken twerps, whom you will hear bouncing of the walls til 1 AM, even though the bar closes at midnite.There are many other hotels in the immediate area.  I have to think one must be better.I had, what I can only image to be, one of the worst hotel experiences here last weekend. We booked this hotel with some hotel points that were expiring at the end of the year and were pretty excited before we got there. My mother called the night before check in to CONFIRM our reservation and the front desk attendant decided to CANCEL the reservation. My mother was very clear that she wanted to confirm and explained this multiple times but the front desk attendant was VERY rude about this. So rude that when the reservation was restored my mom asked what the attendant's name was and he said ""have a nice day"" and HUNG UP. We thought maybe there was ANOTHER misunderstanding so we just called again and asked his name and he hung up on us another 2 times!!! Finally we called from another number (it became very clear he was screening our calls) and got a different attendant who assured us our reservations were restored. We kept asking about if our points carried over and were still used to book the room and nobody at the desk was sure what to say or do. The morning of our check in we called to ask if we could have an early check in and the desk attendant said no. We called 20 minutes later to ask what time check in was and the attendant said the hotel was not busy and we could check in any time we wanted. (WOW with the miscommunication). While it is located in a nice area, the outside of the hotel looks like an abandoned hospital. Upon check in we made sure the rooms would be booked under the points we used when we first reserved the room and we were assured it would all be taken care of. The inside lobby is beautiful and the layout of the rooms were perfect but unfortunately they were the only pleasurable experience about the hotel. Towels were out in the fitness room both times I visited, there were no cups in the lobby by the water, in the rooms the blankets on the bed were itchy, HDMI port on the TV was broken, the sliding door to the bathroom did not close all the way. I could go on and on but I won't because I think you get my point. The morning we checked out we received our bill and by no surprise we were charged for the rooms and they were not booked under the points we used to first reserve the room. We did try to take care of this three times before and were told it would be taken care of on check in. This was all taken care of by the time we left but if we were in a hurry to check out or if our points did not roll in to the new year this would have been a nightmare to take care of. Frankly I wouldn't be surprised if this was not still cleared up and we were actually charged for the rooms. I would NEVER stay here again. I would not recommend staying here at all. We were HUNG UP ON by the front desk attendant multiple times after he cancelled our reservation. I have never had that happen to me by anyone in the HOSPITALITY industry. I feel so ashamed for whomever did this to us. Be aware if you are thinking about staying here.We were there 2 nights. very nice staff.The bath room is kind of weird, the door can not be locked. And it is not quite, I can hear the noise from the bar in the central of the lobby till mid-night.I booked two rooms from their web sight for one night to celebrate my dad's 75th birthday.  When we arrived at the hotel at about 3:15, one room was ready and one was still being cleaned.  I inquired how long it would take and the lady at the front desk pointed at the sign behind her and said ""check in is not guaranteed until 4:00pm.  So, I said that's fine, but she could have  said it a little nicer.  Anyway, as She was checking me in, she said they did have another room with two beds that was ready now.  So, I said Great.  My parents went to their room and I went to mine.  The rooms were nice and clean with mini friges.  My parents room was on the bottom floor and it was very dark because you had to keep the blind pulled so no one could see into your room.   I had also read that they had been renovating and had new mattresses, but it was very apparent that neither of our rooms had new mattresses yet.  They sounded like a haunted house when you got in or out of bed.   So we were taking a rest before going to dinner and when I came down to my parents room they said about an hour after we arrived, someone was using a key card to get into their room.  My dad opened the door and two men had a key card to their room and said they had just been given that room!I have travelled quite a lot in my life and have NEVER had something like that happen.  My parents are in their 70's and I shutter to think about this happening in the middle of the night or when we were out to dinner....only to return and all of their things missing.   So, went to the front desk to ask why this happened and was told ""that's already been taken care of"".  No apology, explanation or anything.Next morning I received my bill under the door and low and behold it was $25.00 more then what my booking email had given me.   After having another girl at the front desk point at another sign that said ""quotes are estimates"". I got to speak with a manager and I asked what the difference in price was for and he then proceeded to tell me that when I checked in, that they did not put both reservations on one account, but separate accounts and that he would fix it.  Then he told me the amount....which was the exact same amount as before!  After telling me this same amount several times, each time acting like he gave me the correct quoted price.  He then asked me what I wanted him to do.  I said ""I want to pay the amount on my reservation that was emailed to me"".  He said ""they quoted you the wrong prices.""  To which I said ""who is THEY?""  I showed him the email confirmation again that said ""Crown Plaza"" and asked ""is this not you?"".  He said it was the reservations office in another place not his specific hotel.SERIOUSLY!In the end, he did charge me for the rooms at the price given to me when I made the reservation plus another $25 for my problems.  I told him about the men trying to get into my parents rooms and he said he would look into why that happened.  For that issue, he gave us free breakfast vouchers.While I appreciate the final result from that day, I don't think I should've had to go thru that.  I have never made a reservation just to be told later that the ""quote"" was wrong.At the same time an addition charge of $275 was placed as a hold on my credit card.  I mentioned this to the manager because they put a hold of $451 PLUS $275 on my card.  He said the $275 would fall off.  So, now almost a week later and it is still on there even after the real charge went thru.  I called the number that was included in the email confirmation and couldn't get in touch with anyone and when you press 0 for the operator you get ""this number has been disconnected"".Long story, finally got reservation desk, they transferred me to guest relations who wondered why I was sent there!! But took a message and said they would fax the hotel about my issue.Finally, a very nice man named Chris called me and said he would take care of it for me.So, would I stay there again?   Are you kidding?I don't know who is running that place, but they seriously need to get their shit together.  There are way too many other hotels that are less expensive to stay at for a lot less headaches.Super experience here! Some of the highlights:1. This place is SWANK! From the front lobby to that awesome ""open-air"" bar area to the rooms, this place is a jewel. 2.  Very friendly staff. Both the dude at check-in and the room service lady were very welcoming -- and it was at the end of the day for both contacts. 3. The shower. Modern, large -- and it gets BLAZING hot, quick! (MUCH appreciated after a long day of travel.)4. The gym. It's actually one of the largest hotel gyms I've seen. Jam-packed with gear, it also has a separate sub-room for the treadmill folk. About the ""bad"" things:1.  Other people have mentioned the noise coming from that ""open-air"" bar area. It's totally true: even with just the TV on and no people around, that sound is TRAVELING. It seems like a non-issue to ask the front desk to room you away from that noise epicenter, though. Finally, the small things that totally make my day:-- They leave an aromatherapy kit on your bed that is the BOMB DIGGITY! In particular, the ""leg rejuvenation"" thing was glorious: that, with the super-hot shower, left me feeling pampered afterwards. -- They've got lots o' electrical electrical outlets right at waist level, including in front of the TV. I know, I know: ""First World problems"" -- but can I help getting excited that I can iron AND watch Law &amp; Order: SVU at the same time?-- The wallpaper: it's a stunner.  Check it out -- tell me I'm wrong. I would TOTALLY stay here again. (Guard your pennies, though! Don't pay the first price you see online. I Pricelined that little baby and ended up saving $45/night.)I travel for work and I was in Charleston for the week. My flight was cancelled and Delta put me up at the Crowne Plaza overnight. I was skeptical, I usually don't veer far from Marriotts and Hiltons, but I have to say the CP was very nice. They are located across the street from the Tangiers Outlets-great outlet shopping if you need anything or just want to shop. The check in process was quick and easy. The lobby has a restaurant to the right and a lobby bar to the left. I would avoid the restaurant, it took forever for someone to seat me--party of one and after 20 minutes of sitting at a table without service I got up and left. There are quite a few restaurant options nearby so it wasn't really an issue. I did have a drink at the bar, the staff were great, seemed on top of things. The rooms were all new and I really liked the decor. They were very clean and the bed was comfortable. I called for some additional pillows and they arrived quickly. Overall a great stay after an annoyingly cancelled flight.I thought this was such a nice hotel it was new and clean.  No issues at all it had the cutest curved chair in the room as well.Loved the shuttle and how fast and courteous is was to my husband and I! The Tanger Outlets are within walking distance with tons of 5star dining as well! The hotel has a small dining lounge one the premises as well. The pool was awesome and just the right temperature!Utilized the Crowne Plaza Hotel for a family reunion, and it was great!These were definitely some of the nicer/more modern hotel rooms that I've ever seen. Very spacious and stylish and wasn't even a suite. Tons of accommodations here from 24 hour fitness, to pool with outdoor fireplace lounge area, to varying sized meeting rooms to do reunion activities in. We had a very large group and actually there were multiple reunions staying here at the same time. We were always accommodated very well and treated well by the hotel staff when interactions regarding reserved areas of the facilities were required.Though there were other families doing their thing as well, no group was ever made to feel less important than any other group (which I've encountered before).Great hotel (across the street from a Tanger Outlet) that I'd recommend!This was our second stayed at the Crowne Plaza for the MUSC Evidence-Based Drug Therapy Update in the last 2 years. I will not be staying again. There was a cockroach in the bathroom that I did not see and stepped on with my bare feet. There were also ants in our room. We brought this up to the front desk who immediately switched us to another room. Unfortunately, that room did not have the same amenities that our original room did. We declined switching to the inferior room and asked what other options there were. The front desk said they would call us back with other options, but they never did. I have never experience such poor customer service before and will not be staying at this location again. I would encourage MUSC to find another location for future conferences.I'm writing this review as I'm laying in bed at the Crowne Plaza, unable to sleep due to the noise level of the patrons at the lobby bar.  As other reviews stated, the hotel has an open design, so from the lobby bar you can see up to all five floors of rooms and noise travels terribly.The hotel is very nice and modern, with a great outdoor pool area.  The beds are great and bathrooms are incredible, there is no bathtub..only a stand alone shower, which is awesome.All of that being said, I would never stay at this hotel again if I needed any type of decent rest.  A lot of aircrew stays at this hotel, and now it is just after midnight and I am unable to sleep due to the noise of the bar, 6 hours before our scheduled takeoff time..for a flight that I am the pilot of.I would have given one star, but I couldn't bring myself to do that because of the great beds and the shower.Came here for a work event and absolutely fell in love with the color schemes and decor in the lobby.  I've been to plenty of Marriotts and high class hotels, but the blues and Southern charm of this one really stood out to me.  Their conference rooms were named after the plantations in Charleston, and there was a large mural of the Charleston harbor hanging near the entrance.  The front desk staff were extremely helpful to me when I needed photocopies made for a meeting and also helped me get the event room set up with materials in a short amount of time.  Would love to come back here to stay sometime.Lovely hotel, amazing southern food, great location if not downtown, very comfortable and nicely decorated rooms.The rooms are so nouveau Classic. Spacious. Couches. Mini fridge and microwave. Beautiful and serene colors in the rooms. I loved my stay here. The design is more consistent with an urban apartment moreso a hotel room. I was immediately reminded of why I love Crown Plaza properties so much.Good gym.Pleasant staff.Airport shuttle.Very comfortable to say the least.I can't find a single thing to complain about this hotel. I loved this place. The rooms were modern, clean, and crisp. (Every hotel should have pocket doors on the bathroom - major space saver!)The lobby bar was good and the food was good. Terrific location with lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance.The chicken spinach ravioli is totally awesome. What great flavor as well a large portion. I forgot to take a picture of my meal because as soon as I took a small bite, it was all over. I must say this meal was a grand slam!""New, Nice, but very uncomfortable, stuffy (poor ventilation) and overpriced!We chose to stay at this location because it is the closest to Tanger Outlets and we primarily came here to shop there. The location is not that bad it's a close drive to downtown Charleston and nearby attractions such as Folly Beach. It's the price for this location that doesn't add up. They do have a Super Walmart within 0.1 miles as well as a Qdoba, iHop, McAlisters Deli, FIve Guys Burgers, Buffalo Wild Wings, and JimNnicks BBQ (great!).The hotel is very new and has a very modern design. It seems relatively safe and well lit especially since it's directly across from the outlets. The staff is very friendly and the place is very inviting. Their gym is average but nice and all the equipment is new. They have a good set of free-weights and some elipicticals and treadmills. The pool is closed until the appropriate season. The other amnemities are a bar centrally located on the first floor with a large screen tv (for watching sports) and a restaurant inside. The bar scene is a turn off as I'm traveling with my family including small kids. The room is very narrow and very stuffy. It looks very nice and everything is very new! Funny because with it being new it really raised my expectations but the bed was uncomfortable as well as the pillows. We didn't sleep well here because of the lack of comfort, there is poor ventilation and the heat/ac unit wasn't working properly, and also due to all the loud inconsiderate group of airforce personnel coming back drunk at 0300 hrs in the morning making noise and hanging out in he hallways. There wasn't a bathtub in our room. You'd figure theyd have enough sense to get us a room with a tub since we are traveling with a 1, 3, and 7 year old. The sink faucet and tv remote werent working, they couldn't fix the sink.If you stay here DO NOT stay on the first floor because the windows face the front entrance and the front entrance invites people to lounge/loiter out there... which they DID all day and night. We had no privacy and couldn't have our windows open because of their modern style blinds only options were open or shut. The tv was very nice flat screen HDTV. There was no eating area in the room itself. They do not offer a continental breakfast so you either have to go to the restaurant or order room service. We ordered room service and it came to $51 dollars and we only ordered two meals and some juices (which we split with the kids).They cleaned our room but forgot to replenish the towel sets.I felt like I had to keep calling guest services for things that should already have been taken care of i.e. the faucet, television remote, and towels.Overall it was not family friendly at all. Maybe it wast the herd of airmen. And not offense, I'm in the military myself, but when you have 150 of single military 21 year old kids staying at these hotels during their training...it pretty much rules out the ""family friendly"" of where-ever they stay. So I am assuming because this is a IHG partnership hotel (and that the military has a contract with IHG) and they have a huge airforce base here... that they get military personnel here all the time! Anyways, for the price I paid ($131, $150) I could've stayed at much nicer areas actually downtown! That's my mistake though. The only positive is that I got 2,000 bonus points for staying here.Upon our arrival, we were greeted by a handsome duck...and realized there are quite a few in the parking lot.  Be careful, they like to lounge under the cars.  They've clearly been fed by humans, so they'll see what they can get from you, too.At check in, we were told that our room wasn't ready. While this was ok, I really wanted to get a run in before our dinner plans.  The concierge was helpful: stored our luggage, offered us complimentary waters because of our wait, and provided me a key to the fitness center.  While I changed and ran, David read his book in the lobby.  This is a beautiful, modern hotel.  The lobby is very trendy and the appearance of facility is very chic!  We were very impressed at our arrival.  Our room is a spacious size and with a different floor plan from most hotels we've stayed at.  It seems like a great idea having the bathroom located at the far end of the room, but not so great when someone gets locked out and the other person is in the shower and can't hear the knocking on the door.  It is a beautiful room with a beautiful bathroom.  Very fancy.My sleep is far more important and that did not prove to be good.  First, I didn't realize how thin the walls were.  We could hear toilets being flushed a lot and it mustn't said that this isn't something I've noted too frequently at hotel stays.  But this wasn't the worst---it was just loud way too late.  I don't even know what time it was, but clearly the design on the lobby was not created for peace.  The bar patrons were a raucous crowd and woke us a number of times.  We are on the third floor, and down one of the halls, but we learned that the loud talking and laughter travels easily.  I'm disappointed as we both want to sleep well.  Perhaps we will request earplugs tonight.  I do think that at some hour, the at should request the patrons pipe down---but it was Saturday night and I'm sure far more important to the bartender to beta good tip and drunk visitors.  I'm hoping Sunday will be better.I guess alot of people want to stay here because it is close to the airport and out. It is more modern but the walls are thin. When we arrived, there was an event going on so it was packed, so much so that we could barely get to the elevator to get to the room. They should have had a walk way blocked off or something. We had a room facing the lobby area... They had no more rooms, we heard everything all nigt...","1) noisy hard slamming room doors (poor design)2) air conditioner quit -had to change rooms3) hammerdrill floor below while trying to sleep?!?4) lousy AT&amp;T reception indoors while excellent outside hotel.5) Showers mis-labelled hot=cold.For the room rate charged not acceptableI was really impressed with the decor-- it is a classy modern feel. Checking in at 1PM was convenient, quick and easy-- even though the sign said check in is at 4. The rooms are great -- having the bathroom in the back made the room seem more spacious. The only thing the room lacked was a full body mirror or really any accessible mirror (besides the one at the bathroom sink and a decorative one above the dresser). Great for business travelers bc it has free wifi and a nice desk set up. Great for leisurely travelers because it is right by the Tanger Outlets and the rooms each have a nice sitting area with a small table that can slide under the couch and attractive pillows and ottoman. My only complaint is that there are no vending machines so if you want a Coke, water, snack, etc you have to go to the store by the front desk where everything is $2. Don't buy any food products in there bc the ones we tried were all stale. Definitely a great option for the Charleston area.The room was a home away from home and better.  It couldn't have been cleaner, quieter and more accomodating for a personal or business trip.  Beautifully decorated.Stephanie, the bartender, was great.  I enjoyed her friendly personality.Room was very modern but extremely damp. I live and travel in the South and have never been in a hotel where my clothes were this wet.  They advertised a premium coffee bean for their brew; however, I had better coffee brewed in a 25 gallon vat in the Marines.  Staff was good.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/renaissance-charleston-historic-district-hotel-charleston-3,Renaissance Charleston Historic District Hotel,3.5,$$$,56,"Stayed here for a couple of nights at Christmas. Location was perfect, service and room were great. Big unexpected bonus: free bike rental with lock provided - we used them the entire day to tour Charleston, this was a perfect way to get around and really made a difference for us.Decent location, convenient distance to mostly everything downtown. The staff is friendly and inviting. Hotel has a modern feel. The rooms are comfortable enough, but the hallway noise pours into the room like a freight train. The doors are not privacy doors in the least. The gym is something to be desired. The equipment is some off brand called ""Technogym"" you can tell that someone who doesn't workout was put to task for buying this equipment. No upright bike, only a recumbent bike. The pool isn't a lap pool, but isn't quite a pool either. The pool and fitness center feel like someone was just trying to check the box rather than putting any real thought into.I booked two rooms for four persons.  At check-in the clerk have me two little milk chocolate squares as part of a points promotion.  One little square per room.  Not one per guest. Didn't make us feel very special. Upon entering one room there was a pronounced burning smell, like a clothes iron left hot on ironing board.  I dialed '0' and waited two minutes for the front desk to answer.  The staff promptly offered to change our room, but didn't seem very concerned that their might be combustion occurring somewhere. There is no apparent ventilation in the bathroom. Excellent if you like saunas after a hot shower, but not otherwise.  The bath towels were all hard and scratchy; the worst hotel towels I've experienced on six continents. Maybe they were supposed to be bathmats.This Marriott Category 8 Renaissance property doesn't have room service!  But the front desk staff will deliver take-out from the in-house restaurant/bar. Thus we got our $23 cheese plate in a plastic take-out clam-shell. Unbelievable. But true. Marriott leaves little envelopes on the bed asking their ""guests"" to tip the housekeeper.  Marriott charges $200-$500 per standard room but chooses not to pay its housekeeping staff a living wage and then asks their customers to make-up for their corporate parsimony.  Unbelievable again. Bottom line: Lodging in Charleston is expensive.  If you're lucky enough to get a cheap rate, the Renaissance is a comfortable property in an excellent location.  But if you pay top dollar, you will be disappointed at the average service.Location is GREAT for visiting downtown Charleston. Rooms are COMFY and relaxing. That's where the niceties stop. This is the first Renaissance I've ever been to that has neither room service NOR a concierge lounge. The restaurant on property, Barony Tavern, has decent enough food (albeit pricey), but there's no room service. I can get it to go, but they wont bring it up?? Ok, so I got an order to go, I get upstairs and I have plastic flatware and the food is served in plastic containers; disappointing. Marriott.. you need to resolve this, I won't be back at this property until one of the two above are resolved; either get a lounge, or get an agreement with the restaurant for room service, but this is ridiculous. If my wife and daughters weren't coming down this weekend to explore the city, I would move to a different property.Dirty, but expensive. Paid for the privilege of internet access to leave an angry review. No food or drink after 11 on FRIDAY NIGHT in central Charleston. No service - no one working here. Nothing but a motel room, in a ""hotel"".Great location and a nice, new lobby. The rooms are standard Marriott / Renaissance style, but that is not a bad thing. The staff and concierge were super helpful and gave us some great tips for our short stay in the city. Wish they had given me a later checkout given my status as a platinum Marriott Loyalist, but that's understood as they were sold out the following night.Location of this hotel is incredible, right off king street shopping and within 10 minutes walking distance to just about anything. The rooms are pretty standard Marriott, clean decent amenities and a little on the small side. The staff are courteous and helpful with a navigation desk that can help you book local tours etc. there are also bikes available, it may even be free, didn't get a chance to try it. It really is a perfect choice for being a tourist in town.Just stay here this past weekend. Rooms were very nice, soft beds and big comfy pillows. Enjoyed the room very much. Very large for a place where buildings are close together. Hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating on food locations and things to see in Charleston. The valets were very friend. Hotel gym was small but effective. Nothing to exaggerate.Always fresh towels there to wipe you off. They all so had a small pool to cool down if needed. The hotel is centrally located to every restaurant in the historic district. Really liked this location. My favorite was the hotel bar. Jim was a great bartender and turned out to be a good friend. I can not wait to take my next 3/4 day leave from the military and see Charleston again.Great location to do most all of the historic holy city by foot.  Very comfy beds.  Good buffett for breakfast.  Charming interior.  Very friendly staff, able to give good suggestions on where to eat, etc. Nice fitness facility.  If you own a Tesla, they have a charging station.Stayed here for a night coming from a Marine Graduation on Paris Island. Hotel staff was awesome, room was clean and neat. We were going to rent bikes to ride around Charleston but the hotel had them for us to use for Free! Location is awesome and we walked to a ton of places. Overall sweet stay, self parking was a little high but demand is high in the downtown area. Would definitely stay here again.Their breakfast is really good, especially the bacon and sausage.  The front desk is super friendly.  And the hotel is really pretty.  I enjoyed my stay here. Its centrally located.  You can walk to a lot of attractions and don't even need the car.  We walked to Poogan's Porch for dinner and it was a pleasant surprise.  If you do need a car to go to further away attractions, valet is super fast and they're really nice too.  Definitely happy we saw Boone Hall Plantation.  Thats a must.  And we enjoyed our she crab bisque, thats also something to do.  This was a super fun stay.You are paying for location at this hotel. A bit pricey for what you get. Walking distance to almost everything, free trolley stop right around the corner.My husband and I stayed at the Renaissance from Thursday-Sunday of Halloween weekend. Upon arrival the staff were all very nice and they had a cute Halloween candy display for guests to enjoy. They did not have the room that we requested (are hotels becoming more like rental car companies in that you reserve something specific only to show up and have it be unavailable?), so we had to sleep in what appeared to be a room meant for bridal parties getting ready, which only had a full-size Murphy bed that folded out of the wall. Odd. The staff were very accommodating though and moved our luggage the next day to a room with our requested King bed. They even left us a cheese plate and a bottle of wine for our troubles.My husband paid a little bit extra for two free drink tickets (he thought it was two per day but it was two tickets in total) and breakfast each morning. If you see this package, I would skip it. The breakfast was your typical boring hotel breakfast, and your money is better spent on breakfast and drinks at a local Charleston establishment. The bar was a happening place though and convenient if you want one drink before dinner. The location was nice as well, as you were pretty much in the middle of the city and could walk to Upper King or the water in about the same time. We would definitely stay here again but would cut out the frills like the drink tickets and breakfast.Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly and courteous valet staff right up to check in. Our room was clean, accommodating but our sensor for our smoke detector chirped. One call and they fixed this immediately after we had left for dinner. Our room included a continental breakfast that was anything but! It was awesome and the server, an older gentleman, was superb!!! Also, we asked if we could bring towels to the beach as I left mine at home and next thing I know, they're knocking on my door with the towels. As a Marriott member for YEARS, I knew this would be s great property, I just didn't know it was going to be one of their OUTSTANDING properties. All of the staff we encountered was friendly, professional and even funny, Tamika. The bar staff is knowledgeable and it has a nice ambience. The hotel itself is in the heart of Charleston's downtown district and walking distance to just about everything. I loved my stay and we will book here again!!Great hotel! Amazing location, loved the pool and ambiance...Friendly service.A little weird on the decor but none the less...we had a great experience.Decent enough hotel - front lobby staff are certainly friendly, as they should be for the rates at this hotel. Bummer there's no concierge lounge and the continental breakfast buffet is pretty lame. They work hard to keep it replenished, but it's nothing noteworthy. The rooms are fine, it's definitely a dated hotel with some obvious attempted facelifts (fresh color paint/decor), revised chandeliers downstairs and the bar area is clean, but don't look toooooo closely. The occasional ""snack station"" in the main lobby is a nice attempt, but the drunk poolside guests clear it of its contents, ultimately ruining it for the rest of the ""residents"". The evening festivities of Charleston certainly make their way into this hotel too - so don't think you're going to catch up on beauty sleep. Prepare to be awoken in the wee night hours..... Location is truly incredible and nearby food is excellent - so it's all in the trade off.This hotel is a joke!  For the prices they charge the amenities and the service is subpar! Only stayed here two night and I could not leave fast enough. Our room was never cleaned. When we asked for towels, May answer the phone and had attitude. Like it was our fault her staff didn't do their job. The front desk was not helpful at all most of them  just didn't want to get involved. It is a real shame this is a Marriott property. We travel often and we have never experienced the lack of customer service and lack of respect! STAY AWAY!Very nice stay with the family this weekend. Great location on King st. Access and walking distance to lots of great shops and restaurants. We really enjoyed our stay. Shelby at the front desk and Clayton managing our service in conference room were great, very friendly and professional.This is my ""go to"" hotel when staying in Charleston.  The location is terrific for the walking vacation that I always enjoy while in the historic distric.  The conceirge staff is incredibly helpful and full of brilliant suggestions.It is worth the few extra dollars to stay in such a top-notch accomodation.Very good located, just in walking distance of many of Charlestons's attractions. Good breakfast for the States with fresh fruits but staff could have been more attentive - we asked three times for coffee. We arrived after one of the regular daily thunder storms/rains and found the room wet around windows - no wonder given that one can look outside just UNDER the door to the balcony, it does not close. In addition, the door to the balcony is rotting away. Ouch. Also when we got back after a day out we found our room not serviced. The street where it is located also is currently experiencing quite some construction work. All in all not worth the money they charge at the moment until they invest some of it.","While the Location is Great and the employees are very friendly the place needs more than just TLC it needs major overhaul and renovation in basically all areasThe appearance in the details is not acceptable for a hotel in that category and that price level.Not to recommend for now...sorryGreat location and wonderful service! The staff was friendly and very helpful. The restaurant was closed during our stay, but the hotel compensated by offering a complimentary breakfast and cocktail hour! The gym was really impressive. Our room was spacious and had all of the necessary amenities. We were so central to everything downtown and walked everywhere. We will definitely stay here again.When I arrived it was pretty early (10am or so) and my room wasn't ready yet. I sat in the lobby and answered some emails for about half an hour and they called me to get my room. The lobby staff were very friendly and courteous. One lady even remembered me and would greet me by name every time she saw me.The lobby area has a very grand feeling but isn't terribly comfortable. My room was very spacious, clean and comfortable.As a Marriott rewards member, I did get vouchers for a free breakfast at the cafe in the hotel. This was also excellent and the staff there were very friendly and attentive.In the last two years I have stayed in 75 hotels and 45ish Marriotts.  This Marriott is nicely kept, but the reason it is the single best Marriott experience I have ever had is because of the service.  Abbey Griffiths (manager) and Suzie Cohen (concierge) are by far and away the two best Marriott employees I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with.  Personally I am very loyal to Marriot brands when I can be so this may seem like a skewed opinion, but if I have stayed at 75 hotels in two years think of how fantastic the service must have been from these two to write this kind of review.The hotel was in a great location as well.  I would highly recommend staying here and introducing yourself to Abbey and Suzie.Really like this hotel. Clean, large rooms. Great staff from the doorman, front desk and bartender. Had margaritas in the bar served in a mason jar, a great glass of wine and finished the night with two awesome desserts. Bartender was engaging and friendly. Easy check out good location.My wife and I were expecting this to be similar to the Renaissance in Providence (modern take on a historical property) given their 4 year streak of 4 Diamond awards, photos and other reviews. Instead I would characterize it to be a well renovated Marriott with great bathroom products (Aveda) and a well designed lobby area. Baffling that it's Cat7. Cat 5 is more appropriate. Wireless internet didn't really work - used Wifi card instead.Great for a business stay but I would stay elsewhere for pleasure.Located in the heart of the historic district with great service and comfortable rooms.  Definitely planning a return.I will definitely return to this location. Turn down service and round the clock attentive service is with the cost. Location of hotel is right on, you.This review is for the spa..... I scheduled a spa (basic) manicure and pedicure. First, Van who did my nails was very good and friendly, you can tell she wants her clients happy.The spa itself is not great I was in small room to get my nails done and it was hot!! The manicure chair and even pedicure chair is uncomfortable. The spa mani/pedi is not worth $94.00 as there are no extra services with it and chairs are so uncomfortable making it hard to relax. Just not worth money based on solely on environment....Favorite hotel in Charleston... Close to restaurants and sights.  Plus good workout options in the hotel and next door (gym, yoga studio and spinning facility all three competing for your drop in).  I always enjoy their breakfast in the morning (the smoothie shot is a nice touch) and the bar for a after dinner drink is a fun option too.However, I've had my worst hotel experience at this property.  During my most recent trip I had to request a room change after being awoke at 1:00am by my neighbors.  It was a room connected by interior doors, and I could hear their every word. Not comforting for privacy and relaxation.  I'm in a hotel 100+ nights a year and this was far worse than the standard talking in the hall and somebody letting a door slam when they stumble in at midnight.If I could give ten stars, I would do it without hesitation. Once we arrived, we were courteously greeted, and the bellman took all the bags with us to our room. The entire hotel was stylish and the room itself enhanced that feeling. The rooms are very spacious with a nice view. The people were very helpful and the beds are very comfortable. The hotel offers free wifi, some people were just not connecting to the right network. I highly recommend this exceptional hotel and I would gladly stay in this lovely hotel on my next visit to Charleston.We were in Charleston for a bachelorette party and the Renaissance was the perfect hotel for the occasion. The location was great -- within walking distance to King St, Meeting St and E Bay St. We didn't have to get in the car once all weekend! The staff is very accommodating and the rooms were large enough and comfortable. We also had a mini-balcony, so it was great to be able to open the door and get some fresh air. Definitely recommend this hotel for a weekend away in Charleston!Fruity water, quiet rooms, location,and awesome food best describes the Renaissance. It is the center of action and ambiance no matter the age group. Need I say more? If I ever come back to Charleston this is the chosen establishment I need to frequent. The service unprecedented, The food is awesome too and that includes room service. I regret to inform my desire to run on the treadmill after eating so much was thwarted by some folks not realizing the 30 minute time limit in the hotel gym, Be forewarned! My only real complaint is the 12.95 fee I had to pay to use internet access at the hotel. I believe this should be included in the price as the price per night for a room is quite high.I was also expecting this hotel to be in line with other Renaissance hotels. The lobby is elegant and nice but the rooms are on the small side and outdated. Staff has been super helpful so far and provided us with early check-in which we greatly appreciated.Clean hotel.  Great staff.  Bt the Marriott corporate policy of not offering free wi-fi is a disservice to their higher end properties like this one.  To pay $450/night and then be told at check-in that Internet is an extra $12 is a joke, and diminishes everything else from that point on.  Wake up Marriott!  It is 2012... not 2003.Oh...but at least it is free in the lobby!  Woo hoo!  I suppose they won't mind if the wife and I hangout down there in our pajamas at night, so we can use our iPads and answer business emails??This hotel was very nice. The rooms were average size, average decor and clean. The staff was very friendly and even offered a ""navigator"" service (we didn't use so cant vouch for how helpful it is). The hotel is walking distance from lots of shops and restaurants and there is convenient parking right across the street in a nice, clean garage. Breakfast and wifi was not included in the room rate - which was definitely on the high end. If i I could, I would probably drop the rating .5 stars for those oversights.  Overall, I would probably recommend this hotel to others.Four star. I am not much of a chain hotel diner but the food was top flight. Grits and scallops rank as my best ever. I doubt one can go wrong with anything on the menu. The place has pride in its food and the servers show it well.Nice rooms and great locationThe ONLY place to stay for the annual Charleston 10K Bridge run. Parked the car across the street and never touched it for 3 days &amp; nights. Small fee for parking - fabulous. The staff is incredible: valet, bellmen, front desk, bartender ( Henry is sooo great at cocktails especially concocting a great drink with Firefly sweet tea Vodka). rooms: wonderfully appointed, great bed. The hotel is on the last 1/2 mile of the bridge run: we run by it and then after the race...walked right back to the hotel. What a super experience: Renaissance has hit a home run here. Look forward to returning for another visit.We have stayed at many of the historic district hotels over the years and this place is one of the best.  Great location. Clean, well-equipped rooms.  The staff are great...helpful and courteous.  Give it a try...you wont be disappointed.","I really enjoyed staying at this hotel.  This hotel was recently renovatated and it shows.  Our room was very clean and beautifully decorated.  The bedding and furnishings were awesome.  Also, the room had a 32"" flat screen.  Not that we spent much time watching TV.  wink winkThe hotel is centrally located.  Their employees were very friendly.  I would definately stay here again.The interior shows its age, but is charmingly decorated, staff were top notch (we made lots of requests and they were all graciously attended to) and it's in a great locale (short walk to anywhere you want to be).Perfect location, clean, great service. The best Valet guy I have ever seen/known/experienced in my life. Every Valet guy should take notes from him. Aveda products?!! love it! The gym is perfect with new equipment, televisions, and balls. Great lounge chairs by the pool, although the pool is atrocious. You can fit maybe 3 people swimming. Ha!Overall, happy with out stay. All the great little details that you want out of a hotel.Not what one expects for $470.00 a night...  even at a $40.00 Super 8, I get free internet!!!  small room, no fridge, no view, no mini-bar, no complementary water, no parking ($17 a day to have it driven across the street), NO comp Wireless internet, no continental breakfast, I returned @ 2pm and my room still was not serviced...00.00 of the amenities a professional traveler expects. Staff were very, very nice but in no way made up for the downfalls... I am NOT coming back to the Renaissance and do not recommend you do either.  Cheers and Safe travels to all.A great hotel.  The staff goes out of their way to be helpful and us very attentive to your needs.  Quiet and comfortable rooms.If I could put 0 stars I would. We've stayed at Renaissance in several countries and states and this is by far the worst. Room size and style is a joke, very outdated and cramped for a hotel of this ""quality"". We tried calling down for more pillows twice and no one answered or assisted. At most hotels they assist you w your bags but they didn't seem to care (or notice) that my 6 month pregnant wife was lugging her bag around. Don't get me started on the fact that they nickle and dime you for everything. Sometimes when you pay $350+ for a room you expect free wifi and some ""extras"".....but not here at this Renaissance. You must pay for it all. Pool is the size of a large hot tub with the view of a brick building. Not sure what all these people are saying about location. It's decent but not great. It's still a nice walk to anything you want to see, I was expecting everything much closer based on other reviews and price. I know Charleston is a little pricey, but their are other hotels much more convenient and appreciative of your business. I will never stay here again!The staff at this property is great and always willing to work with you. I'd say some of the room decors maybe a little outdated.You'll need to walk a little bit (not far) to get to the heart of Charleston so the location is great and the service is great...not sure what else I can ask for.They don't have a fitness center (at least I don't remember one) at this property. I think you have to go across the street to a local fitness center.I never get excited by hotels.  The ones in my price range are pretty much always the same.  Same boring rooms, same hotel smell, same cheap soap, same crappy coffee maker, same tired staff.  Renaissance shook me out of that boring old cycle.  Their desk staff were really friendly, quick, and professional.  The room was very nicely appointed  It actually looked like the photo above (we even had one of those crazy tube pillows).  The soap and other various toiletries were top-notch.  I don't even go for that stuff so much, but I thought they all smelled great (in a natural way, not like synthy-sweet mega brand soaps).Not that we were there to watch tv, but there was a nice big HD LCD in the room.  The view from the third floor was of a jumble of nearby rooftops.  But everything in Charleston is so low I think you could hardly expect a sweeping view.The fitness center was totally adequate.The hotel's location was very convenient to everything.  We saw the City on foot, mostly, leaving from the hotel each day.Parking is located in the garage right across the street.  $13/day, unlimited access.Nice work, Renaissance.I expect a Renaissance to be a cut above some other hotel chains. We did not find this to be the case. The hotel was well-kept but furnishings and carpetting were old. We had requested a king bed but received two double beds - something that might be due to a travel agent problem.  To compensate, the front desk (very nice) gave us ""the nicest view"" - a 6th floor room that overlooked a bunch of small buildings...go figure.The fitness center was limited but there was a gym across the street that worked well for the $10 fee.I always choose hotels based on the criteria of clean, comfortable, good location and price.  It doesn't take a lot to please me. this hotel always delivers.  I'm not a big fan of the ""southern touches"" in the room but hey, do as the locals do. Location and the price I got won me over.After a bit of a rocky check-in from a not-so-happy employee, I don't really have any complaints. The room was very clean and comfortable. All of the other staff I dealt with was very friendly. If any issues did come up, they were quickly resolved. I don't think the pool was heated when I went as it was pretty chilly. The breakfast buffet was really good. Location was GREAT!Stayed here last week for 3 wonderful days in Charleston. This hotel is tucked away downtown. Very convenient. Not over the top fancy, but quite nice.  Starbucks on site. Valet parking. Had a large corner room. No bathrobes. The staff was excellent. Everyone was friendly and knowledgable.  I would look forward to staying here again.I have very few criticisms of this place.  It was one of the best hotel experiences I've had in a while.Our hotel room was exactly as described and was in a quiet location as we requested.  However, you could hear noise from the hallway.  My partner even woke up at 2am because the noise from someone showering next door was too loud.  We would also hear people slamming their doors or kids running down the hallway.There is no place to hang a hand towel by the sink.  You have to fold it up and lay it on the counter.  I would really prefer a nice, simple hook like I find at most hotels.  The only place to hang a full size towel is on a hook on the back of the door.The beds are nice, but they turned out to be too soft for me.  By the end of my three day trip my back was a little sore from sleeping on the bed.The best feature is the heated swimming pool.  No, you won't think you're in Hawaii, but it is warm enough to swim outside even when the weather is 60F and below.  I used that pool twice. The staff were all consistently professional.  I never got the attitude from anyone that ""I can't help you, it's not my department"".  The front desk people didn't hesitate to pitch in and get me my car when the valet was busy.  The hotel operator was very helpful in giving advice about where to eat.I would definitely consider staying here again the next time I am in Charleston.Great staff. Good location. Soft bed. Nice tv. Concierge was outstanding.The hotel is very nice, clean and located in the heart of Charleston, convenient to historic downtown, the marketplace, restaurants, bars and shopping.  We use Frommers as a travel guide and it has always been very helpful.  It is important to note that of all the hotels in the ""expensive"" category in Charleston, this hotel was the only one which charged for Wi-Fi, to the tune of $13 per day.  Also, we self parked at the parking garage across the street, for which we paid the hotel $13 per day.  As we departed the parking lot the last morning  at 6 a.m.,  (there was no attendant because of the early hour) the machine which regulates the gate for exit was malfunctioning. Were it not for the man behind us on his way to work, we would have had to pay additional fees just to exit.  It was a fairly tense moment.The location is probably the best part of this hotel- it is conveniently located in downtown Charleston and within walking distance of great restaurants and shops! We stayed here using Marriott points (30,000 points for 1 night), not sure I would be as impressed if we paid the regular rate. The king bed was very comfortable and the room, lobby and hallways were clean. The front desk staff was very friendly, although I was unimpressed with the concierge who was very blase about giving us a dinner recommendation. In the end we got a good recommendation out of him....  after being told it was the busy season and reservations were nearly impossible.",,,"['couple', 'nights', 'location', 'perfect', 'service',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/charleston-harbor-resort-and-marina-mount-pleasant-3,Charleston Harbor Resort & Marina,3.0,$$$,57,"We finished our stay here. It was a discounted price so we thought great! But you get what you pay for I suppose. We arrived and noticed a bunch of construction.Here is the short list:1. Hotel is under complete renovation (even workmen and orkin on the floor we were staying)2. No pool (that's right it's closed for the time being)3. Moldy mildew smell in room4. Bathroom configuration is completely off. (You have to walk in close door then sit on toilet not vice versa)5. Trolley and water taxi start late in my opinion to take you downtown at 10am (which doesn't allow you much time to beat the crowds - which forces you rent or use your own transportation. 6. Resort fee $12/day (gym, trolley, paper, refreshments i.e. Water n popcorn) plus state tax and tourism tax. So approximately add on 25-30$ per rate to get a better figure of you are budget conscious. Positives 1. Great location just outside the city2. Water taxi and trolley although the schedule did not fit ours.3. The beach and the views  spectacular - my toddler loved playing in the sand 4. They will make you a fire pit. All in all I may go back once everything is all finished and updated for a discounted special.The hotel is in an excellent location. The hotel itself is going through renovations. The staff went above and beyond for us! They built a fire in the fire pit on the beach just for my family. We were the only ones out there. That made our stay so special and we will have those fond memories forever!I understand that hotels have overheads, profit margins and other expenses.  They need to make money. I get it, but...If I'm going to be charged over $250 per night with an additional $12 per night ""resort fee"" I have some expectations.  I expect my room to be in near perfect condition (this isn't a $34.99 per night place).  Please see the pictures of my room, RM 321.  At first glance the room was bright and festive.  After only a few moments in the room many of the flaws were obvious (dust, rust, disrepair, unsightly outlets).  Again see the pictures.Here's the short version.  This was last stay here.  It's just way too expensive for the convenience of being close to attractions and for what you get.  If their weekend rates ($270) were the same as their weekday rates ($125) I would give them 4 stars. But I've been left with the feeling that I've been overcharged.  As an added disappointment, I was told that I could not park my motorcycle under the awning on the first day only to find that another motorcycle has been there for the past two days!  Thanks guys!Unless you get a rate under $188 ($200 - $12 resort fee) you might suffer from feelings of disappointment.Had high hopes for the trip and while some things fell short others surpassed expectations.Best surprise on the trip was the shuttle into downtown that was included in the daily resort fee and the quick access to the water taxi (not included but right at the resort.  One of the concerns I had coming was driving into downtown so having these options and being able to leave the car parked the whole visit was huge.Staff was friendly especially the concierge -Jeffery (I think) who went above and beyond with some recommendations and drawing them out on a map for us which was needed because there was no amenities/attractions book in the room.  several times had to call the front desk and couldn't get an answer and room was not fully serviced the first day.The bar has a cool water front vibe though prices are high which I guess you expect at a resort.The room itself was very small and had a feint fish smell. Couldn't tell if that was from the restaurant, the outside or something else.  Biggest complaint was the only visible outlet was in the bathroom which had no fan.  Had to pull the bed out to access an outlet for the typical cell phone chargers.Pool was nice and chairs comfy, though there were a small family of crabs in the pool so not sure if that is normal or not but was definitely entertaining to see.Overall full price here is way too high, we used a groupon for our rate which is what gets it an okay value rating from usLike an old grand dame who's lost her family fortune, this dump looks like it was once nice.  However, since it's no longer nice, the price is an outrage.  The basic cost isn't that awful but by the time you add-on a ""resort"" fee (that's a joke in and of itself) and all the taxes, it was $170/night.  I've stayed in Hampton Inns, and Marriotts, and Hilton Garden Inns which are more elegant and far less expensive.  The room was small, the bathroom even smaller, and everything was just tired.  The room smelled musky (or like onions or cat pee?), the towels were small and worn out.  We had breakfast in the little restaurant off the lobby and the cook couldn't make over easy eggs! Soon after I turned mine back because they were hard, the table next to us returned theirs with the same complaint.  All in all, find another spot.  You'll be happy you did.Absolutely HORRIBLE service. Left the dock master several voicemails, called every phone number on the automated directory and never received a call back after 2 days. We were traveling by boat from Philadelphia and still never heard back once we were within an hour away. Thank god for Charleston city marina! They were great. If I were you I would go to the city marina and not this hell hole!!Poolside drinks are pricey but it's hot out and I don't care!Other than that, this is a decent resort.  I'd say a solid three stars.  No more though, the pool has been consistently filthy on many of my visits and it's pretty unsatisfactory.  Good location, plenty of parking, and fun activities to keep everyone entertained.I hate to pop the nay-sayers bubble,  but I also booked through Hotwire and I am totally happy with the hotel,  my room,  the drinks, the food,  the view (did any of the negative Yelpers catch either a sunrise or sunset--awesome), the staff,  the parking,  and the free bicycles.  The hotel is going through a renovation (hence a 1-star deduction),  but this is a quality place.   I spent around $120 out the door via Hotwire and local taxes/fees.  Would return in a heartbeat!I've been here 5 minutes and it's going to get 2 stars already.  We booked through club corp which in turn uses a travel agency.  We got the best price u could get.  With that I don't expect the best views from the room. But really? We r on the second floor, and not only do we have the parking lot view, which I would not care, but we have to largest dumpster site right out out window!  I have stayed at cheap hotels that didn't have this kind of view from their worst rooms... Pretty sad.  I would never stay here again!  It's the middle of March, I'm pretty certain they r not booked up and could have given us a better room!! I DO not recommend, they don't take care of the customer to the utmost!! $300 a night and I'm starring at garbage!!*****UPDATE! Called front desk and complained. At 1st they said that side of building is all booked up!? What?  Anyway, it would cost more to move to other side with a view.  We told them how unhappy and we would let our travel agent know.  5 minutes later they called back and gave us a room with a view. Thanks! U went from 2 star to 4*****UPDATE UPDATE**** after spending a night in this place, I would NEVER come here again!  It's hot as heck in this room and it's 1 am.  I'm pretty sure the front desk was aware of this when they moved our room!  The fan is so freaking loud it's ridiculous!!! It is outdated!  The bathrooms are icky. Do yourself a favor, go elsewhere!We love to visit Charleston as often as we can. Every time we do we stay at Charleston Harbor Resort and Marina. We do this because we know we will have great rooms for the price with extras. I enjoy all of the authentic artwork on the walls. We can depend on the extremely helpful, respectful, caring staff that go out of their way to make sure our needs are met. The breakfast is very good. The pool is ok, nothing exciting but with so much else to do it doesn't matter. It is right next to museums, restaurants, and a golf course. There are activities planned if you want to participate or you can check out a bike an go for a nice ride on the bike path. It is always a great experience.Really loved this hotel and the ambiance.  Friendly front desk and staff.  Everyone said hello, even the guy pushing trash from the marina.  Good ol' southern hospitality.  Our room was upgraded to a balcony room with great harbor views.  They have laundry facilities, a great bar,  and several restaurants onsite plus a free shuttle.  Really liked the decor in the room with the bright harbor and beach motif.  They also have bikes you can use.  Would definitely recommend!I would never stay here again. First, my room had not been throughly cleaned when I checked in - there was a used bar of soap in the shower and no shampoo. This morning as I was getting ready I realized there was no hairdryer. It took 15 minutes and more than 5 calls to get someone to bring me a hairdryer. This place is in need of new management that understands the business travelers or really any traveler and cares about meeting expectations. Finally I ordered room service last night and it was not only the worst shrimp and grits I've ever had, they delivered it in a styrofoam container in a bag. That's take out not room service!Average at best. Poor value for the price. Room was small, bed moved with every breath. View very nice. The pool was nice and clean,  no pool service while we were there. The restaurant is good with very nice views of the battle ship. There is construction going on during the day.I would give this place negative stars if I could. It's hands down the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. Don't stay here, motel6 is better. Had bloody sheets 3 nights in a row and terrible service. When we stripped back the bed because we had to change our own sheets, the bed cover was also bloody. Told the staff and nothing happened. And when we checked out and showed the manager pictures, didn't get any compensation or anything. This is the first time I've written a review for a hotel because no one should go through what we went through.We stayed here because of a discounted price we received through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a>.  We ended up spending about what we would have spent to stay at a mid-level hotel. After staying there, I almost felt a mid-level hotel might have been nicer. The room that we stayed in was very outdated. Our view from the patio door with no balcony was of a parking lot visible through two palm trees growing right up in front of the door.There was no place to set up your luggage to unpack because there was very little room between/around the furniture in the room. Nice TV, but no good channels. Staying with a 2 year old and a 4 year old, it's always nice when there's a nick jr or disney jr, but no dice. We turned the tv on the first night and realized there were no good channels, so we watched tv on our own iPads the rest of the stay. Which could have been better if the internet connection wasn't so slow. The mattresses and pillows were very uncomfortable because the mattresses were very dated (I know this because my husband sells mattresses for a living). The pillows were all down pillows, which provides no neck support and leave you a little stiff in the morning. Most hotels provide a couple of different options in pillows, but the Marina did not. The bathroom wasn't necessarily dirty, but seemed very dirty, probably due to wear and tear and the fact that it needs to be updated. Also, they provide a blow dryer in the bathroom; however, the one in my bathroom didn't work (even after hitting the reset button and trying it in several outlets). All in all, I wouldn't recommend this hotel (resort, ha!) to any of my friends. I'm sure there are better places to stay in the area, when we go back this summer, we'll let you know! :)I can't speak for the hotel or the restaurant, but the pool area and the bar are great places to hang out during the warm weather months. The Marina is pretty standard, but no complaints about the slips or the staff.  Definitely worth a visit!I stay here 3-4 times per year I don't understand individuals complaining about the cost as this hotel is the most reasonable in the area with the best amendies. They offer great amendies such as a free shuttle to downtown Charleston, free bikes to ride around town, free internet, a board walk, free concerts for guest in the summer, a swimming pool, free coffee/tea, and a very polite staff.  I love the fact they remember who I am... It's one of the reasons I keep coming back.Spent the past two nights at this wonderful resort. Was a bit apprehensive due to some reviews mentioning construction noise, but we didn't hear a thing. Got a great rate online, nice view of the harbor, and near the USA Yorktown. Breakfast buffet was expensive ($14.95) and the food was nothing special. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.Stay there this past weekend, and it was a dismal stay. The room itself seemed nice and clean, and the staff was good, but so many issues, most small, but a couple were large.1. Poor lighting. With every light on in the room, it was still ""dark"".2. Slow internet. In fact, it would even freeze all together and lock up.3. Curtain wouldn't open. The wand wouldn't pull the curtain open, so I had to pull the curtain from the top to open it, and it cut my hand.4. Shower dispensers not locked. The soap/shampoo/ conditioner vessels had locks, but weren't locked. Anybody could have put anything in them.5. Insufficient fan. The bathroom fan would not clear the room after a shower. I had to use the room mirror to get ready.And these last three, were major to me...6. Nice 42""(?) flat screen TVs, but poor standard def programming. Why have a 16:9 TV when you broadcast those black bars on every channel?7. The ice machine was broke on my floor. I had to go up or down a floor everytime I needed ice.8. And this one made me mad...I had 2 hours to kill, and found a decent movie to watch (even tho it was a poor picture). About half way into it, the picture went away. When I called the desk, they said it was common to lose programming when it rains. Really? I would not go back to this resort based on the above issues.We loved this place.  Nice and quiet and not far from downtown. Fort Sumter is incredibly close by.Our room was big with a nice TV and a soft, comfy king sized bed. It was an amazing value because we booked last minute on Hotwire for $60! Of course we upgraded to get a better view and with that fee, the resort fee, and all the fees Hotwire added on it was more like $100, but that was still a great deal considering all the amenities and the level of comfort/how much we loved the room!FYI though, I did not make use of the internet so no comment on that. Also, we only stayed 1 night so we didn't get a chance to check out the restaurant, the pool, etc (plus it was 50 degrees and rainy, and it's an outdoor pool)!I was also very indecisive on whether to upgrade, and we actually used the restroom in the first room before I changed my mind. When I asked for the room change they were incredibly courteous and got me switched over right away.Also, room service was quick and the food was good.","We found this place online and decided to take a chance.  Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to find a clean, nicely decorated property with easy parking, great access to local venues, and a super-friendly and capable staff.  When we experienced car problems, the staff went out of their way to find us alternate ways to get around including ""Ollie the Trolley"", their own vehicle.  Restaurant recommendations were great and we actually spent more time on Point Pleasant than in Charleston.  We had a great view of the harbor and marina and my only issues were that the beds are VERY soft - we prefer a firmer mattress - and a bathroom door that wouldn't really shut all the way.  We'll come back again.My husband and I spent our 18 wedding anniversary there. We have paid less for more! The room wasn't up to par nor was the dinning! In fact in the dinning area table clothes were stained, I found a bug floating in my coffee mug! I could go on, however it's really not worth it! The desk staff and bellhops were pleasant. What made our anniversary wasn't where we stayed, it was being together! We won't be staying a second time!!!!We had stayed at this Marriott Hotel at Patriots Point on a previous trip to SC but opted for another hotel on this visit. Big mistake. : /  We did manage to make reservations for Easter brunch at the hotels restaurant though. Good decision. : )) It was wonderful. The tables were set up outdoors and the water view was fabulous. The food was very good. They had an Easter egg hunt for the little ones which was so fun to watch! Excellent job! See you again soon.I was a tad bit wary about staying here after reading the reviews, but in the end I am glad I went to experience a stay for myself. My group arrived on New Years Day and discovered that our rooms were facing the construction site (the resort is building a new hotel next to their current hotel). As we were there for relaxtion, we were worried about the noise (and we wanted a better view). We spoke with the manager and he was able to change our rooms (but not until the next morning). Our new room provided a beautiful view of the water and beach area. Every staff member we encountered were very polite, friendly, &amp; helpful. The resort provided bikes to ride, a van that provided transportation to &amp; from downtown, and a full breakfast buffet (which was free with our package). The best part of the stay was the fire pit. The hotel provides the wood and fires it up. We throughly enjoyed our stay and will return again. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because the beds weren't as comfortable as I would like.Not at all what we were expecting.  Attractive hotel, but rooms are kind of small and outdated.  Our particular room had a view of what appears to be a storage area.  We went out from about 9-2:30 and the room wasn't clean when we got back, so I guess we're not getting a clean room today.  Additionally, there is NOT a beach here.  There is sand that ends at very large rocks.  About 2 feet below the rock line is water.  So our beach resort resulted in a 20 minute drive to Folley Beach everyday.  Oh, and there is ZERO water pressure in the shower.  This place isn't bad, but it's not the fancy resort it's advertised to be.Nice place to stay at a reasonable price. It seems like an older ""resort,"" but it was still a good stay (not the current types of resorts that I typically think of though). I got this stay through Priceline, however, they add an additional $12 resort fee. I think that is something that Priceline needs to work out because it was discouraging to have to pay more when I thought it was already taken care of. I guess part of the resort fee goes to a free 4-hour bike rental and a trolley to downtown Charleston.The front desk asked if I'd like to upgrade with a better view, but for $35-$45 more and the only time I'm in my room is to sleep or get ready, I didn't think it was worth it because I don't stare out my window. You also have to pay for WiFi.It has a great location between the downtown Charleston area (5-8 minute drive) or Sullivan's Island (10 minute drive) or Isle of Palms (10-15 minute drive). It does not have it's own beach, so you'll need transportation to get you to one. But it has a pool.The grounds were clean and quiet. The room was brightly decorated, clean, and did the job! However, the shower curtain smelled moldly/sour and the A/C fan was going all night. Some may like that to reduce any outside noise. I didn't hear any other hotel guest, but not sure if that had to do with the A/C or if the walls are thick. Overall a good place to stay, saved me hotel money, and I was able to have some Charleston fun without breaking the bank. I'd stay there again if that is where Priceline gets for me.Beware, our trip on the 4th of July week was not good...This is what was promised and confirmed with our online reservation:*Beautiful Room with Harbor View, quiet and undisturbed surroundings for the 4th of July week for our Wedding Anniversary, and my Birthday...What happened?*Room was above a loud noisy bar.*Room stay was interrupted and changed to a higher requested floor.*Loud Rock Concert barraging the guests to run and hide!*All access roads were blocked off during times of activities...Huh?*Strangers and Visitors running all over the grounds to hotel, not approved.*For staying 4 nights, we were 'promised' by a temporary hotel front desk person (they did not have a regular staff, overworked by the Holiday) one full nights credit - it never was posted to my account.   A very frustrating experience, and just read the other reviews...what a shame.Stayed here while scoping out places for room blocks for our wedding next year at pavilion@patriots point. We got a rate comparable to Hampton inn nearby, but figured this would be nicer, being a ""resort""and all. WRONG. The room is filthy, the bed has a huge sag in the center, and the refrigerator can't even hold one take out box. The bathroom was like something you'd find in a 1986 apartment; tiny, dirty, shower curtain covered in mildew. Just not worth it for the price, and in the summer, it's closer to $400/night. Save your money and stay in Charleston or somewhere else.Just finished a two week stay involving ten other people and nine rooms.Spent a bit of money to say the least.Stopped by the 'Reel Bar"" tonight (9:45pm) to grab a bite seeing how we were exhausted a after a long week with limited wifi, dirty carpets, despondent employees and excessive noise.The bar was empty but for four other patrons, yet the bartender told me to ""Hurry up and order, because it was late"".Really?Wow, what ever happened to customer service?I ordered a plate of hummus and pita wedges and told the bartender I hoped it wasn't too much trouble.He told me ""The kitchen staff wants to go at the end of the day"".Wow, so do I, but not if I'm on the clock.Perhaps they should all quit and let somebody else fill their positions.I hear there are a bunch of people who would appreciate a job right about now.........Booked a stay here through Priceline- $800 for 5 nights- not a bad deal. You get what you pay for.We asked for early check-in (because check-in is at 4pm, which is REALLY late) and got in around 1. Without paying for the upgrade, we were also given a balcony with a view, which was nice.There really isn't a beach here, it's a marina, so there is sand, but you can't wade out into the water. There is a pool, which is refreshing. One down-side is that if you are looking for some time away, you won't find it at the pool. I was completely surprised by the amount of families and children at the pool each day when there are multiple beaches within a 20 minutes drive! We would return to the pool after the beach and I'd have kids splashing all over the book that I was reading or into my drink- however this is not the hotel's fault, but the parents.One hidden fee that we were charged is an extra $12 a day for Internet, TV, the trolley, and a few other things. Overall, this was NOT worth the expense. While we stayed at the Harbor Resort and Marina, we could get no Internet connection in our room and when we moved into the lobby we still had difficulty getting a connection and quickly gave up. Additionally, the TV's cable stinks. One night we decided to rent a movie on the TV to quickly learnt that they did not have that option, nor did they have very many channels to choose from. It is worth it for the trolley if you have a big group of people and use the trolley daily. It's about a $15 cab ride to and from Charleston, so if you use the trolley, you are getting your money's worth.We did not eat at the hotel, so I cannot comment on the food, however we did order margarita's one day and they were $10 for each. I expect high prices for drinks at a hotel, but this was too much to handle. Needless to say we went out and bought our own tequila and mix to make them in our room and save money.On another note, everyone that we interacted with at the hotel were courteous and nice. I'd recommend staying there because the location was great and the price was right.One thing I was suggest doing while you are at the hotel is to run or walk over the bridge. It has a beautiful view and is worth the effort.I was here in October, 2013. Frankly, the service here sucked. The room was just OK.   The location would have been fine if they actually had a shuttle service that was worth something. For the price, I'll look elsewhere next time.I stayed here recently and loved the place. The hotel room was very uniquely decorated, very beach inspired, nothing like I have seen before. The pool and beach area were great, also cold poolside water! The views are amazing. The best perk is the free trolley service to downtown Charleston and Sullivan's Island. The place is a little pricey but it is worth the splurge. I would stay here again.I agree with Erika B. Customer service was CRAP. Reception staff were apathetic, unfriendly, bordering on rude. (What is up with Charleston's poor hospitality?!)  Concierge is absent Monday-Thursday and when reception told me that information they acted like it was normal.  The bicycles that you can rent are also CRAP - they don't have hand brakes and the seat was so low (and not adjustable) that my knees were above my belly button!On the upside, the room was decorated with fun patterns and colors. The pool was lovely (except for all the kids running around) and the sandy hangout area was relaxing. Very convenient location to the marine museum and the water taxi. Not a bad walk to Nature Adventures (for kayaking) and to some great restaurants on Coleman blvd (Coleman Public House and ZuZu's among them!). Also a nice bike ride away from Sullivan's Island. Room service was expedient and polite and the green salad, fish tacos and sweet potato fries were all delicious (from the Reel Bar). In summary - rude reception staff, but good location and decent food.This stay was somewhere between Meh and A-OK, but I think my expectations may have been too high based on this being called a ""resort"", and other stays at resorts in Myrtle Beach and hotels in Charleston.We were in town to attend a concert and I was staying on a Groupon.  And while the price was discounted, it was still up there in price.  I believe we could have stayed downtown for what I paid, and since it's the off-season, most of the ""amenities"" weren't in play here.   The resort fee is $12/per day (per room).  The day we checked in, the gentleman and young woman working the front desk were VERY friendly and helpful, as was the gentleman that I handed the card keys to the day we checked out.  Those I spoke with in between were meh, and the one who got an attitude with my mother after she asked if there was a phone book almost got the wrath.  My moms room was decorated very well - built in cabinets with a cabinet-mounted TV, nice finishes and furniture, with a remodeled bathroom.  My room, directly next door to hers, looked like it was at another hotel except for the wall color and the coverlet across the foot of the bed that matched hers.  Bathroom toiletries are in wall-mounted dispensers which kind of felt cheesy (again, keeping in mind this is touted as a ""resort"").  Both rooms included small dorm fridges, single serve coffee makers, several glasses and an ice bucket.  While her fridge was hidden in the wall cabinets, mine was sitting on the floor (seriously - the rooms were night and day).  My TV was on some kind of energy saving crap that made it too dark to see (I finally figured out how to correct this on the TV itself, not the remote, after giving up the night we checked in and just watching Big Bang Theory on my Kindle).It was very quiet both nights we were there - no hall noise, slamming doors or stomping feet.  The bed was comfy, though I wasn't a fan of the small, mushy pillows.  I did like that the A/C could be turned way down, as I am always hot.  No vending machines, you'll have to pay $3 per bottled drink (there were snacks too) downstairs in the general store (closet).  I didn't have any trouble with the Wi-Fi, I was able to check email and surf.The biggest disappointment was the breakfast that was served.  It was part of the Groupon deal, so we had vouchers.  Had I been forced to pay for that, I would have been livid.  Served buffet style with good choices, but they were all cold.  And I don't mean on the other side of warm, I mean cold.  Eating at 9:00 on a Sunday morning, bleh.  Cold eggs, cold hash browns, cold grits, cold coffee.  The bacon and sausage were delicious, so I made a bacon sandwich (which got me the stink eye from the cranky Yankee broad at the next table, mind ya business!).  The 4-year old at the table next to us, after drinking some of the ""orange juice"" said, ""this tastes like water, this doesn't taste like oranges at all"".  Out of the mouths of babes - the OJ is so watered down that Tang would be an improvement.  And both mornings we went (the second day was stale bagels to go), the young women working there definitely put off a vibe that we were all inconveniencing them by being there.I read another review about the Yorktown view, which was correct - the Yorktown view is a dirt/mud parking lot, a dumpster, a port-a-john, and in the distance is the bridge and the Yorktown.  Depressing.Nothing was horribly offensive, but nothing was so awesome as to justify the rates.  I think my mom was a little disappointed, though she said nothing since I paid $600+ for 2 rooms/2 nights.  This was probably once a grand dame, and now it just seems a little aged, even with the facelift.The room is a little outdated but the view and staff make up for it.  Would prefer the room to be a little bit bigger.  My room had room for the bed and that was about it.Our room was awesome! It was beautiful and we had a ceiling fan, with is a super rare find in hotel rooms! They have beautiful built-ins cabinets and plenty of room/storage for unpacking! Room comes with a nice size mini fridge and a giant TV! The beds were so comfy, sheets were so crisp and soft and the pillows! Wow! The pillows were like little heaven clouds and they load the bed up with them (which is great for a pillow hog like myself!). The bathroom was beautiful, tub was a deep jacuzzi tub, had rain shower heads, plenty of counter space for all of my hair tools and products too! Plus the staff was awesome - especially the guy who drives the trolly; he rocked!!! Unfortunately, I didn't catch he's name but He gave us a list of awesome late night spots to hit up and every time we ran into him walking around the resort, he was so friendly and always made an appoint to say hi! Great guy! We will definitely stay here the next time we find ourselves in Charlestown for random weekend trip!  Oh and forgot to mention our rate was beyond fair for our stay! Actually, I would say we got this place @ a steal for how nice of a place it is! Great job guys! We will see you all the next time we are in town!Sometimes hotwire hits the nail on the head and sometimes it misses completely.  We had stayed in a 3 star hotel the day before in Asheville and were very pleased then we got here.  Outdated does not begin to describe the room or hotel.  Went to check in at 330 and was told the room wasn't ready. At 430 we finally had a room. Our view was of a storage/trash area and parking lot. Not a single ice machine was working in the hotel. Our door lock died and it took 45 minutes to get into our room causing us to miss the trolly. Room was never cleaned. Every night it sounded like we were above a garage band trying to learn their instruments. The beach was sand on rocks no access to the water.  ( not great for my 1 y/o)The pier was so rotten and splintered I was afraid to let my 1 yo walk on it. And the big one ( I'm a Firefighter) I went down the stairs to avoid waiting for the elevator and found the fire door blocked by construction debris. You give me bad service oh well you risk my family's life you're going to know about it.  I told the front desk and the answer was a unconvincing oh we will take care of it.  The next morning when it wasn't fixed I payed a visit to the local fire station.  This hotel doesn't deserve 1 star let alone the 4 it supposedly received.The location is 4 stars. The rooms are 2 stars at best - average 3 stars. It is a glorified hotel. If you have to be on the Mt Pleasant side, it is a good choice. Check out the aircraft carrier also.Excellent hotel, with a great staff.I stayed at the Harbor Resort and Marina during the offseason (around Christmas) and may not be getting the full picture. I understand that there's a 9 month window under which this place gets fully rocking and rolling, with a beautiful beach bar (respite with fireplaces and tiki huts) and a nice pier overlooking the whole Charleston harbor area.Anyway, the place was very clean, with dutiful housekeeping cleaning the tornado we left them every day. The bartender gave me a beer for free on my birthday. (.....And it was Fat Tire.....what?! NICE!) Wouldn't hestitate to give them another try if I came to the area again. Thoroughly enjoyable experience. I'm docking them a star because they accidentally charged us for an extra day (which has since been removed) and because the prices for the incidentals and food are pretty insanely high. I'll pass on the 4$ ""shots"" of water, thanks. They also failed to share our outrage over finding a ""Palmetto bug"" skittering across our floor. (It's a Charleston cockroach.....that doesn't gross us out any less, people)I found this place online, and has become a habit of mine, I called for reservations and found out that this hotel also has a significant discount for law enforcement and government workers, so do not pass this up by booking online.Situated at the end of patriots point the hotel is out of the way from all the traffic and noise of any near by roads, BUT is extremely accessible from Charleston and Mt. Pleasant.  There is free parking in a expansive lot, and I felt my car was safe the entire time.When I checked in the desk upgraded my room without request or price increase to a bay view, which was quite a treat as I could see all the ocean going ships coming and going from the harbor, and I also had a stellar view of Charleston from the window.  I did not have a balcony suite, but beggars can't be choosers.  The room itself was pretty, and I choose that word with care, it was actually pretty.  Brightly painted, bright curtains, white cabinets, flowers placed about.  It felt comfortable and a bit like a freeze frame of what a tourist would think a southern hotel would look like.The bathroom was large and clean, with great water pressure. There was also a mammoth pile of clean towels, so there was zero worry about running low.Outside was cold during my stay, thus no use of the pool, which was nicely situated with a view of the ocean and a tiki bar right next to it.  The hot tub was a different story.  That was fair game even in the 50 degree weather.  I liked the size of the tub, easily fitting 10 or more people, but the water temperature did not get hot.  Warm, yes.  Hot, no.  that was disappointing.Everything taken into consideration, I would choose to come back here for another stay while visiting Charleston in the future.  The staff was giving, and went out of their way with upgrades and suggestions of ghost tours and things to do around the area.  Also, I later found out one of my very good friends spent her wedding night here and could not say enough about how well she was treated.","This was a wonderful hotel located at a pleasing distance from the heart of the downtown historic district.  The location offered water taxies to the popular Market St. markets.  It offered standard amenities that you would expect to find at a resort but the waterside location with the sail boats docked at the marina could not be beat.  We even used the resort bikes to pedal our way to dinner.  The rooms were charming and I would definitely recommend other to stay here and I would stay here again.Don't be fooled by the Resort Name - Over priced, poor service, dirty rooms, poor management- I booked through Travelocity with a special rate (if you call $118 a inexpensive rate). It was a resort with a good location so I did not mind paying for a luxury experience- WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! It started from the second I arrived.First, let me set the stage. Midweek stay, the place was deserted, the parking lot was almost empty and the bar/restaurants had no one in them, the pool/beach area had 1-2 people sitting around. As I stood there waiting to check in, the front desk woman to answer the phone several times. When she finally finished, I presented her with the Travelocity confirmation page at which point she informed me that ""THAT' room is not ready. She did however inform me that with a upgrade payment, a room may be ready immediately. I had just driven 9.5 hours from Washington DC. I was further informed in no uncertain terms that it was a non-smoking facility and and I would be CHARGED if I break the rule. Since I am a non-smoker it really is not an issue for me, but, I really did not like the implied threat. I was so taken back by her comments that I seriously considered dragging the manager up to the room both prior to accepting the room and and pre-checkout to ensure we were all on the same page. I informed the young lady that I was going to use the gym while I waited for the room and of course paid the resort fee, which I have no problem with. She prepared me the guest card and directions. l asked if there were lockers, locks showers and towels at the gym for which she replied, maybe, I'm not sure, yes. The fitness center is located 3.5 miles away at a development called I'ON - it is not on site and has a lot to be desired especially when there are top of the line facilities in the area. The I'ON fitness center does not have towels. It would seem to me that the front desk would know this or would make the effort to find out for a guest. They weree pretty quick to collect a resort fee but don't seem to want to provide resort service. Upon leaving, I asked when she thought the room would be ready and was told check in is not till 4 and it may be ready after I get back from the gym but they will call me and let me know for sure. They did call me - at 4:21PM as captured on my cell phone logs.After returning from the gym I was given room 323. For the prices, even under the Travelocity deal of $118 a night, this room was atrocious. It was beat-up, dirty and I was appalled at what I was given for the price. The ancient TV slides out out of the cabinet when the doors were opened (not level) and it had a terrible picture quality. The bathroom has dirt, mold and mildew imbedded in the tile around the tub. No soap in the dispenser at the sink (for 2 days - staff did not even fill it when they made the room up after the first day). It would be one thing to put up with this while looking at a beautiful beach but I was looking at the parking lot. This is not a resort quality room by any standard. Day 2, I went to the lobby around 10:15 for coffee at the coffee station by the front desk to find both empty. What really got me was the same young lady who had checked me in stood there looking directly at me and seeing that there was no coffee. She made no effort what so ever to assist. The most basic budget hotels do better then this.Nice location but absolutely not worth staying at. I was visiting other people who had stayed at The Charleston Marriott which is located at 170 Lockwood Blvd for a lot less. Good location, nice room, nice staff. I was very disappointed that I had made the wrong choice. Don't be fooled about this place - stay elsewhere.The hotel was OK at best.  Do not kid yourself....this is not a 'resort'.  There are no resort amenities other than a slightly dirty pool and a lukewarm hot tub.  The previous comment about the exercise facility was spot on - they really don't have one if you have to go 3.5 miles to get there.We also had an ant infestation where the night hotel staff told us they didn't have anything to deal with it and we would have to wait.  And no discount. Yuck.  If you stay here rent a car.  There are no taxis and the (oft broken) shuttle doesn't run with great frequency or is full many times.  If you stay for multiple days it will be just as expensive to rent a car as it will be to pay for all the car service trips.  The onsite restaurant is not worth mentioning from any perspective.  Same goes for the bar and general service.  We got a 'wedding rate' that was over $200 a night.  Absurd for what they offer and provide.  Save yourself some serious dough and stay at the Quality and/or Holiday Inn Express nearby.The bed WAS really comfy - just make sure there aren't ants in it first....A late addition.....the rate they quote you for a one way airport shuttle is $35.  We just got charged $65 because their contract guy was late picking us up and we would have missed our plane if they hadn't called a different service.  Why did this become my problem????  DO NOT EVER STAY HERE!!!Be careful with this resort.   First problem was they doubled their rate and their reservation person didn't inform is.  The trolley service into down was very sporadic and not convenient.  Also I got a lot of bites on my ankles.   They may have a bed bug problem.  I'd avoid staying there.Overall a disappointing experience. This place calls itself a resort and I'm still wondering why. There is nothing about this place that Justifies the price or resort label. Let's start with the room. We were given a room with a nice view overlooking the pool and the harbor, but the Windows were crusted over in what looked like a mix of salt and soap scum. The room itself had no dresser, no drawers to put away clothes. There were some cabinets built into the wall but one had a mini fridge in it, the other had the electronics for the television in it. Speaking of the tv,  this one was not formatted to fit the screen and for some reason the volume needed to be turned up to 100% to even be heard, also the remote barely worked and there was no channel guide to be found. Not a huge deal, not going on vacation to watch tv. But it's the little things. Just shows how little they care for the state of their rooms. The iron was broken also, missing a whole plastic panel, with open wiring. ice machine was broken. The bathroom door was a heavy sliding door with no handle and no lock. Meaning to close the door from the inside you had to pull the edge of the door hard and pull your hand in hopefully quick enough so you don't smash your fingers. Again no lock, and even if there was, privacy is compromised due to the 2 inch gap between the door and the wall because of how the sliding door in mounted. The ""Resort"" has no gym or spa on the site. They suggest you go run over the bridge for exercise. Seriously. Also we were excited about using the water taxi and trolley to get to Charleston. Unfortunately the water taxi was not running when we were there and the trolley only runs every 2 hours. Meaning for a 8 pm dinner we needed to take the 4pm trolley back to get ready to take the 6 pm trolley to town to get our 8 pm dinner. It really cut into the time we had to do things in town. Made use of the Reel Bar for drinks, which was totally fine but not special. As a rule we do not allow housekeeping to come in our rooms so I can't comment on those services. All in all its an adequate place, you get a room and a bed, but for the price and name you expect so much more. Unless you're staying for free there is no way I could recommend it, there's just way too many better options in the area.THIS PLACE SUCKS NOTHING LIKE IT IS ONLINE AT ALL. The area its in it Great but the Hotel SUCKS!!  There is black mold in the Air vents if you have allergies BEWARE!!  They had to switch rooms for me because I found two yes... TWO cockroaches in my room.  There is rust all over the bathrooms.  The rooms are disgusting.  PLEASE DONT STAY HERE!!I bought a groupon for 2 nights this week...said kids under 17 stay free but beware that does NOT include their breakfast at $17.95 each...what hotel gives adult a voucher for breakfast but not kids?  I actually called before we left to make sure breakfast was included for kids...was told it was...that was not the case.  The guy @ the front desk told me he ""wrote"" the groupon &amp; I should read the fine print...I did &amp; it said nothing about children having to pay for breakfast.  He argued with me out front and it embarrassed me.  Seriously my granddaughters ate 1 piece of bacon &amp; didn't want more because it was raw....the breakfast at hampton inn is a lot better...also 3 towels for 4 people is not enough...only 2 rockers &amp; 3 tables outside...that is not a resort...its' rundown, needs updating...no umbrellas @ pool..tha a/c fan does not shut off &amp; very loud..that is really not a beach...just some sand brought in...this is definitely not the place to stay if you are looking to go to the ocean...or anywhere...I have never in my life had someone at a hotel call me a liar.I stayed there recently.  I made a reservation and was quoted on the phone a government rate of $141, the maximum government rate for Charlestown (and for my employer).  There was no mention of taxes (assumed there would be) and no mention of additional fees (assumed there would not be). After trying to check in three times over 90 minutes (the room's not ready, and the room's still not ready), they charged a 'resort fee', for WiFi, a shuttle, and the pool. It was $12 a day (""less than we charge most guests!""). I had the choice of either paying them, or leaving.  I paid.   I put it to the clerk that the charge was unethical, and she would not disagree.  (she agreed, actually).  She was nice and helpful.I just checked their web site, and attempted to make a reservation.  I'm through to the paying part, and no mention of resort fees.  Ahh, but if you check the credit card terms and conditions, it is there if you scroll down a popup window: (<a href=""/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbooking.ihotelier.com%2Fistay%2Fistay.jsp%3FHotelID%3D3635%26LanguageID%3D1%26DateIn%3D4%252F1%252F2009%26month%3D4%26day%3D1%26year%3D2009%26length%3D1%26rooms%3D1%26adults%3D1%26children%3D0%26x%3D152%26y%3D17%23some%2520history%2520token&amp;s=785c22bbe66937b860d23ff617a513aea7b311bb15603da9bec02ced2ad941d0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.ihotelier.com/is...</a>).  Others describe this type of charge as arising out of either greed or mismanagement (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elliott.org%2Fthe-troubleshooter%2Fresort-fee-folly%2F&amp;s=e2122d066e330dee8938389f41b78c0f7c5282b4fd2dddf5071a0bd9cdd0256b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">elliott.org/the-troubles...</a>).  In this case, I'm left thinking it is both as the hotel was both. I enjoyed part of my stay there, and I could comment on what was good at this hotel, but I found their behavior totally reprehensible, slimey, sleazy, fraudulent, scummy, shameful,  scam, and/or unethical (take your pick!).  Next time, if it was for work, I would consider going to the Comfort inn or the Holiday Inn (250 Johnnie Dodds Blvd., Mount Pleasant, SC  (843) 884-6000) or the Holiday Inn Express ( 350 Johnnie Dodds Boulevard, Mt Pleasant, SC - (843) 375-2600) down the street.  If it was for pleasure, I would stay downtown, as it is a happening scene.  I'll review Blossom later.This review is based on my experience with the hotel on Friday nights when they put on Party at the Point which runs from mid May to Mid June.  As you approach the hotel at the end of Patriots Point in Mount Pleasant you notice all the natural beauty surrounding the property...beautiful fountains in two small lagoons on either side of the road leading to the entrance, Charleston Harbor straight ahead and to your right, a beautiful marina filled with gorgeous boats also to your right, and if you take a minute to turn around you get an exceptional view of the USS Yorktown. The hotel lobby itself is always in nice condition but the few times we have had to speak with staff they do not seem very willing to answer questions or have much friendliness.  As far as everything else you encounter when at Patriots Point...you cannot find a much more beautiful location. There is a beautiful pool outside, with a man made beach (with the best sand in Charleston) leading up to the rocks, tiki huts, and lots of great views while taking in the music.  The price for admission this year was upped from $5 to $7 and beer prices also were upped to $5/beer. When the weather is right, there's no better place to start your weekend off. Hours only run from 530-930 for the event.I would not stay at this hotel again. The rooms are really small and the bathrooms are cramped. The patterned comforter had some old stains on it and I doubt it was washed. The front desk did not seem very accommodating when it came to requests. We asked where we could get bowls, spoons and milk for the cereal we had brought. The front desk girl has no idea where to get milk. She thought maybe the kitchen. Well, at three in the afternoon the kitchen was not open at the indigo restaurant. When indigo was open, I stopped by asking for bowls and spoons and the girl gave me a hard time saying ""you can call room service"". I asked her what the problem would be if she gave us a couple of bowls and she just heaved and went to get a couple. Definitely not very accommodating. Sorry grabbing bowls is such a pain in the A for you. Front desk people should have answers. Oh, and we came back to our room in the evening to an uncleared room. Housekeeping working till 5-5:30 pm my ass. Find a better place to stay unless you don't have any needs.Beautiful, clean, big place!  We booked a few nights here through Priceline's name your own price and were shocked that they accepted $70.  We thought there would be a catch but once we got there, we realized we just got lucky!The resort is quiet and very clean - it's about 10-15 minutes from downtown Charleston and a $15 cab.  It was nice to come ""home"" here and feel like we got away a bit.  The pool looked great, though we never actually swam, and there were daily activities (hot chocolate, cook outs, etc.).  There is a $12 resort fee for wifi and the trolley, but we took a the trolley a few times and it saved us the $15 cab ride, so it was worth it.The water taxi departs right from the resort, which makes it convenient if you decide to venture into the city that way. We arrived a bit late (after informing them) and they said our room was taken so they upgraded us to a nicer one.  So for $70, we had a room with a balcony, view of the harbor and city, and a ton of space.  It was just the perfect place to vacation.  The bar downstairs was busy but not so loud that you could hear it upstairs.  Would go back here in a heartbeat.So far so good! My first time in Charleston and I couldn't be happier with this place. My  room is fabulous....I guess this is what they call 'southern charm'. The rooms are adorable - hard wood floors, upgraded furniture, bathrooms re-modeled...so cute! Enjoyed dinner at the hotel bar called Reel Bar - awesome food and great service. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend. Best part is....I pricelined it for cheap!We spent 2 nights here after having spent 2 in downtown Charleston.  I have to say we really liked staying on the island.  It was so close that it was no big deal to drive over the bridge if you wanted to go downtown and the views of the harbor were really beautiful.  This hotel experience totally goes to show that it's all about who you get at the front desk.  We booked our room with Am Ex points, so we didn't pay for it directly.  When we arrived, we were put into a ""standard"" room that overlooked the dumpsters (really).  The room smelled horribly of cigarette smoke, but was supposed to be non-smoking, so I called and asked to be moved.  When I went back to the front desk, a new girl was there and she was so sweet and ""upgraded"" us to a harbor view room that overlooked the pool and the harbor.  Anyway, if you are going to stay here, I think the harbor upgrade is a must.""Insects, blood stains, and moist carpet the entire stay!"" When I called the hotel directly to book, they stated I needed up ""upgrade"" and pay more money for 2 queens. I ended up going to <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FQuikbook.com&amp;s=c57c579525640dd7828f0037864aaeadea1abfd3346980f87387daafe800e624"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Quikbook.com</a> and it had an option for 2 queens at the advertised cheapest rate. I went with my friend as a girls vacation before school started. The room reminds is very Vera Bradley-esque. It ended there. When I opened the closet, there were insects. I saw blood stains on my comforter on the bed. The carpets were moist and damp the entire trip. I believe it was never properly dry, and the air conditioning kept it moist. It was hard to walk around bare feet. The staff was nice enough, but after seeing insects and blood within 5 minutes, I was ready to leave. The location is right off the main bridge, so it's about 5 miles from downtown Charleston, and about 3 miles from Sullivan's Island beach. Great location. Hotel looks nice outside, but inside was another story!One of the most expensive places in/around Charleston. Too much to complain about. Did not live up to expectations at all. We booked the Sumter Suite, big mistake. Had to move to a new room due to noise from air condition units and due to the fact that we could not see out the windows that were corroded over from weather. The real kicker for me was the roaches, which they say cannot be helped in South Carolina, no matter where you stay. I don't live there, so I don't know. Second room was a deluxe King suite, and we were very happy with the room and location of the room, but then the roach's brother showed up, needless to say that last night was a bit restless because every time I heard a scratch I thought I was being carried away. We did discuss with the manager and we were refunded part of our money and he seemed genuinely concerned. The resort itself is absolutely beautiful, but prices need to be slashed much more for fall and winter since many of the ammenities are not available: tiki bar not open; fire pits not burning, etc...if they fix these things, they will do ok.Came here in the offseason (Mid-Oct).  Origonally we were booked into a room overlooking the dumpster.    After speaking to friendly staff at the front desk, they graciously offered to let us move to a different room immediately.  I opted to pay an extra $20 a night for a room with a balcony.  They gave us a beautiful room middle unit overlooking the pool with an ocean view.  It was totally worth the extra money. We spent a lot of time when we were at the hotel sitting on the balcony reading and enjoying the weather. The hotel is very nice, staff is very friendly.  We had a few minor issues setting up the dvd player and had a dead battery in a remote control.  Staff came up within minutes to address our problems.  Complimentary root beer floats in the lobby every day from 4-5pm also.  The pool is very clean, they have a nice jacuzzi by the pool to relax.  We scored a great deal (50% off regular rates) to top it off through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>.  We stayed here for 5 nights, and hate to move on to our next destination.  They also have a free trolley from the hotel into Charleston if you need it.  If not, it is a short drive over the bridge (5 minutes into the city).  You are right at patriots point, minutes to USS Yorktown and Fort Sumter tours.  Plenty of places in the area if you want to go for a long walk.  Just ask for a room not to overlook the dumpsters.  That would have been a big negative!  Other than that, this place is fantastic!Extremely pleasant place (fun-colored furnitures) for a very good price. 10 minutes drive from Downtown.",,,"['finished', 'discounted', 'price', 'thought',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-and-suites-historic-district-charleston,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Historic District,3.0,$$$,59,"Stayed here 2 years ago for Memorial Weekend. This place was a zoo but nonetheless it was because it was centrally located to all the fun stuff and its historic value that it had.Good ole Southern hospitality was felt. First, my boyf called ahead of time to let them know we were celebrating a special weekend and if they can accommodate us with anything special.At check-in we learned we were upgraded to a suite. What a huge suite!! Not only that but the hotel offered complimentary champagne and chocolate strawberries. I loved that the boyf thought that ahead of time, but it was nice that hotel management honored his request on such a busy weekend.The decor was rather old but then again if you are staying at a place called Historic, what do you expect. You have to valet because of the location of the hotel. However, the valet was fast and we had no problem. Room service were always available and when I come back would have the boyf book this place again.So disappointing!I travel for work and stay at Hiltons whenever I can. This is not by any means the worst hotel I've been to, but it is not up to Doubletree standards. Let me start with things the hotel can do nothing about. The location is awesome! Right next to the market and walkable to pretty much anything in town. Now the rest. The lobby is beautifully decorated and the staff is very friendly. The breakfast is meager, however. Also, the bar in the evening was in the same area as the morning breakfast. Like they literally moved all the stuff off the table and pulled up some stools. It was bizarre. The room was nice enough and clean. I ended up in a suite which was two levels, kind of cool. But the shower was unacceptable. The water basically dribbled out of the showerhead, no pressure at all. Until they do some renovations, specifically regarding the shower, I will not be back. There are so many other options.Dissatisfied.  As a Hilton honors elite, I expect a clean room and a room with a view. My room had a view of a roof and balcony extended to the large air conditioning unit, overcoming all sounds in my room. When I ask for a different room due to the view and noise of the AC unit, the huffy staffer snappishly states ""sir what would you like me to do about it.""  First you can move me to a quiet room, second you can take your attitude and stuff it.  What a wonderful way to be greeted on a quiet getaway. Will not returnGreat building,  great location (next to the market) however the hotel itself is nothing special. here for the night with wife and kids before heading out on a cruise.  5-10 minute walk to the cruise pier. 2 minute walk to Toast for breakfast -  highly recommended. The suites have a 2nd floor yet the HVAC control is on the main level.  Thus a significant difference in temp was experienced between the two floors.  The rooms themselves were average, small cramped shower area. 2 stars. UPDATE:  post cruise,  our entire gang walked back with bags in tow,  left them with the bell hop/valet before walking to breakfast.  For this,  they get 5 stars! Overall -  meh.  It will do for a night but anything more,  I would reconsider....Wonderful hotel! The location was amazing - super convenient!Our room was more like a suite - it was two floors and had a great sitting area, mini kitchen, and huge bedroom. The bed was comfy, TVs were nice and had a bunch of channels, the showers/bathroom were clean and water pressure was good. The staff were very friendly; the front desk was beyond accommodating. The lobby was really nice and was a great place to take a load off. The only downside was the price but I would expect that for the location and the size of the rooms.Location gets 5 stars. However I'll NEVER stay at this hotel again. Please read on if you care about your accommodations, your money and how you are treated.Layout of room and design off lower interior are. Ok, yeah, you get a cookie at check in. Big deal. That's with every double tree. The big thing is location...you can't beat it. The dining area is ok, and servers are very nice.Issues:-they act like scammers regarding their rates and other fees. They tell you at the reservation stage a rate, what's included , then suddenly during your stay that story changes and they claim it's a AAA rate though you never actually provided or were asked for AAA proof???  When you argue that they charged you crazy lodging fees and dining fees for what WAS free aka comped breakfast, they are rude at the front desk. VERY rude. Especially the guy Jason. He hung up on our party and become very defensive when the bill was questioned. They say that a person greatly defensive when posed a question is already admitting guilt. this hotel staff is shady. -in room there is an ac unit in each room.  It's temperamental at best. One night woke up to 72  another 76 another 64. Had maintenance here twice and one time was told. It was because they don't change filters or clean vents enough.-No water in rooms. They don't offer at check in but when you realize this you call then they say you need to ask the desk for water when there. They don't offer to bring to you. They tell you to come down to get it. I find that funny not because I feel entitled or am lazy but in hospitality services typically they'd offer giving you the options to come yourself!-leaking faucets. Omg, how can they not fix this little random stuff?? A new washer is all they need. I've had to listen to leaking faucets for days.-I was on fifth floor, an honors member suite. It looked clean and tidy but I saw 3 bugs in 3 days in the hotel too close for my comfort. Two in my room and one in hotel hallway on another floor. They looked like roaches. It was enough to cause me to not sleep well. I did check bed but I still felt gross. I also had volleyed say they saw them in elevator and on 3rd and fourth floor.-$40 hotel tax per night??  In addition to all the typical hotel taxes you would pay for lodging state etc? Strangely high. -No shuttle service, no room service after like 7pm. No store on site for guests but when you go out to find store everything closes at Sun <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdown.do&amp;s=e619f4fb71f2e655d782b53b162e878ac505d1db19873dc0779b5348141ad1fc"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">down.do</a> you are stuck until the next day. You'd think they offer a cookie, ha ha!-scent of water mildew as you enter rooms.what's the deal? If they had water damage they've hidden it well.but the smell is coming from SOMEWHERE and I'm on fifth floor!-alarm clock cubes...No led display that's lit. We all had same issue. So it wasn't just mine. So odd. Can't see any info on the screen and you needed to unplug or that alarm hours off all hours. Also one of our room telephones had zero service. They said it was MY NOT HAVING THE LIGHT SWITCH ON. I'm like, no, it's you not having working telephones. Never had a stay like this in twenty years with a Hilton hotel. This place...Never again!Ah, room 373. Inconveniently located behind the gym on the 3rd floor, &amp; certainly not between room 371 and 375, where any normal person would expect it.  That way you can wander around looking for it until you go back down to the front desk and ask where it is.Once inside, after realizing it is not a coat closet, you can focus on taking the coat hangers out of your actual closet to get the roaches off the top of the window box that holds the curtains, which is seemingly designed to have just a tiny enough crack on all sides to give roaches a nice roach sanctuary.  But really, this room is smaller than my bedroom in a NYC apartment.In the morning, you will be awoken as your room literally shakes over and over again over the course of the hours from 6-9am. Is there a fight happening next door? Should you call the cops? Seems to irregular and non-vocal to be a fight...no, that's just the gym weights being slammed against the wall shared by your headboard as they are re-racked!  Why the hotel would arrange the gym in a fashion to disturb a room every morning and night, is beyond me.Bonus complaint: when the sheets were changed the duvet had a brown sticky spot on it.  What even was it?  How wouldn't you notice it since it's in the middle of the duvet?Perhaps the other rooms in this hotel are nice.  But it makes no sense to have this terrible, cramped corner of this building be made into this excuse of a room.This hotel doesn't even deserve 1 star. As a frequent traveler I've stayed in many hotels and this was one of the most disgusting establishments I've ever had to stay in. First off, as other reviewers have mentioned, this hotel has a HUGE COCKROACH problem and infestation. This building needs to be cleared out, cleaned and bombed by an exterminator. Hello board of health, this needs to be addressed! And they are charging over $330 per night! Ha! Let me begin by saying my stay in Charelston was for work and the company booked our hotel rooms so therefore I was not paying for this stay out of my own pocket, thankfully. Although, what is important is that the work days were extremely early and long and included client dinners afterwards each night, therefore getting a good nights sleep was imperative.When I came across the first batch of roaches they were babies, which I found very disconcerting and proceeded to go down to the front desk to complain. The guy at the front desk seemed unsurprised and bored with the complaint. He offered to spray my room the next am when I was out at work and I gave permission to do so. When I came back to the hotel the next night I confirmed with the front desk that my room had in fact been sprayed. When I got to my room and started to get ready for bed, low and behold there are bigger mid-size cockroaches just chilling in the bathroom, on the sink counter where my toiletries were located, hanging out in the trash, racing around the carpet, ya know just a good old roach party going down in my room. I took photos (of course, although my phone camera just doesn't do it justice) and immediately rushed downstairs to the front desk where I demanded to switch rooms. Once again, I was greeted with an almost bored and unaffected, not surprised employee who informed me that there were in fact no rooms available and that they were completely booked. Unbelievably, I exclaimed to him that he was basically telling me I would have to ""sleep"" with the roaches for tonight. He confirmed this and told me they could switch my room the following day. I was disgusted, angry, exhausted and freaked out all at the same time. I obviously didn't get much sleep that night and was completely exhausted the next day at work which was a 14hr work day. When I returned the following night after the long day, they did in fact switch my room to another one on the same floor located right around the corner from the roach room! So laughable it was, they said that was what they had available after I shared my obvious displeasure in the turn of events. They didn't really care. Obviously. And guess what?! The new room had cockroaches too! Wow, what a surprise! Beware of staying in this hotel, especially on the third floor. Also worth mentioning: there were several black hairs I saw in both rooms, one on the pillow, several in the bathroom and shower. I have dark blond hair in case you're wondering. Such a terrible experience, and I will never stay in a double tree ever again.A mixed bag.  Definitely a 5 for location.  You can use their valet (you pretty much have to use their valet to get parking) and walk everywhere in the French Quarter.  The service is marginal - not great, not bad (maybe a 3).  We had a one bedroom suite.  It was nice to have the extra space with a little kitchenette area.  I recommend staying off the first floor.  There is a lot of activity outside at night.  It can be noisy.The fitness center was OK.  Nothing fancy, but adequate.One thing that really bugged me was the lack of attention to the amenities in the room.  The iron was missing, someone had left a toy in one of the drawers, and the safe was locked.  A quality check of the rooms would be a key to improving the experience.Stayed at this location in July of 2014 for a bachelor party.  Hotel is in a nice location and pretty central to downtown.  The front desk people were very nice. The highlight of our stay here was the delicious warm cookies that we received upon arrival.  These where damn good cookies!  We actually ended up buying a tin late one night after getting back. The room was nice enough and clean. Whenever I travel I take a flashlight and do a thorough inspection of the mattress, headboard, etc. Until you do this you have no idea how dirty most hotels are.  This place was definitely clean and I felt very comfortable sleeping on the mattress after finding absolutely nothing (zero sign of bed bugs).The crowd at this hotel seemed to be the young/party type. For a bachelor party, this place was great, but not sure this would be my top choice for a family.  Can't hold this against the hotel, but loud drunk people were disturbing some of the rooms.Fantastic hotel, great location, extremely clean establishment, and the best of the best southern hospitality.  If anything is not right, the staff steps up to fix it promptly.  Highly recommend for business, family, romantic, etc.  Best stay I have had in a very very long time.  Kudos to a well run hotel.  A little bit more money than courtyard and WELL worth every extra penny.I used some of my Hilton points and I've now stayed in this property twice. As parking in downtown Charleston can be a challenge, I've also taken advantage of their rather spendy  Fantastic location that is right next to the City Market and with great access to the downtown area.The first time, I had a bi-level suite with a sitting room and wet bar downstairs and the bedroom area with bathroom upstairs. Very cozy, very quaint, and unexpected. If you're not a stairs person, this might be a challenge. The second time, a standard suite with a sitting area with a separate bedroom area with closeable/lockable doors.In both cases, the rooms were relatively quiet from noise due to neighbors though at one point some inconsiderate folks were shouting in the hallway.Valet parking is recommended. It's $25/day but you have unlimited in and out privileges and they also don't seem to have an issue if you keep your car there for a few hours after the usual check-out time.The free breakfast was nothing special. You'll be better off heading to one of the nearby restaurants for shrimp and grits, or biscuits and eggs.Summary: Great location, good property, great staff.We were in a King Bed Suite and thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  It was quiet and very large.  The couch in the sitting room showed wear and tear but that didn't bother us. We were surprisingly happy.  Breakfast was solid- eggs any style, sausages, bacon, yogurt, granola, bread pudding /pastries.  Front door bellman could have been friendlier but that's a small gripe. Otherwise front desk staff /wait staff at breakfast were excellent.Stayed here while attending the Renaissance Weekend speaker series a few blocks away. It is a very convenient location immediately next to the Market in historic downtown. Valet parking in the underground garage, helpful concierge, small but clean rooms. Fridge in room, microwave at vending areas on each floor. Choose a courtyard room to avoid street noise, which includes restaurant traffic on Market St, a panhandler who plays the melodies of 1980s hits on a xylophone (which projects wide and far) until about 11pm, and masses of tourists on foot. Also be prepared for horse urine smells at the lobby entrance, as the carriage tours hang out across the street.Fantastic location. Nice rooms. Overpriced. Parking rip off.It is next door to the slave market, where there are plenty of restaurants and bars. You can walk to King street where there are more restaurants and bars (and shopping if your girlfriend wants to do that). The hotel is nice, but it usually costs over $250/night on weekends during the spring and summer. It's not worth that much, but it's a good $150/night kind of place. Beware the room service is expensive. It is not like regular room service. They have a partnership with Hank's restaurant next door, so the food will come from there. You will spend at least $40 on dinner, no matter what you end up getting unless it's a burger or an appetizer. Internet access is super slow. If you are not a gold or diamond HH member you have to pay for it. Don't unless you have no other choice. Think of slow dial up. It's that bad.Parking is valet only and it costs $22/night. The valets park in the city garage around the corner. You can park there yourself for 15 bucks (or so I'm told).Ask for room 305. It is larger than the regular ones and costs the same price. It has a huge window overlooking the courtyard.Reservations made by a group we were with that had a full day meeting in one of their conference rooms.  We were in room 475... and despite the smaller than normal entrance door... it was a nice suite, with sitting area and working desk, wet bar and a separate sleeping area with king sized bed and it's own TV.Front staff were very pleasant and hepful.  Breadkast and lunch and snack served during the full conference day was better than most.  conference room was comfortable, with very comfortable seating, chairs and thermostatic temperature control.Overall a very nice experience aside from ONE complaint.. the PARKING... while I don't like valet parking, that is apparently the way to go, but I did park at the deck Friday after 4PM until 4:30 PM the following day for only $20.  It was the Bank of Am. bank parking deck asjacent to the hotel.  Valet parking was $27/day.They are central to the downtown area and only a stones throw from the ""Market""... so if you plan on parking it, and hoofing it around d/town, this may be a desirable location.My girlfriend and me stayed here over the past Fourth of July weekend. We had a very positive experience here. It was located right in the heart of downtown and we could walk anywhere we needed to go. The staff was friendly and courteous. The only problems a that the front desk didn't seem knowledgable about the restaurants in the area but it didn't influence our overall impression of the hotel.Fantastic hotel and stay! They are extremely attentive and kind. The room was huge and very clean. Amazing location! Would definitely recommend this hotel for a visit to historic CHS.Great location but our room was unbearably small and cramped. My hubby and I typically prefer an updated and modern hotel and this was painfully traditional. Not our style. Also, the room was a little dingy.Great service, good staff and the lobby is nice but our room just wasn't that great and it was considered a ""suite."" We wouldn't stay here again for that reason alone.This hotel has a killer location if you're looking to be in the heart of historic Charleston. Sure, it sucks paying for valet, but i enjoyed not having the headache of searching for parking and just walking out of the hotel to start our day. It was even nicer ending our day not having to drive back to the hotel after exploring the bars of Charleston. i did use Hilton points to book the room, so the room price didn't factor into my equation. It's a little trek through the courtyard to some of the rooms. We were in 303 and it was great, had a nice view overlooking the courtyard. Our bathroom was one of the biggest bathrooms i've ever seen in a hotel, so based on other reviews, that must vary by room?No complaints with my stay here.","Octavia in the breakfast restaurant is a real sweetheart. You can tell God has blessed her to serve others. How refreshing. The hotel is fine and a great location. People are great. Not over the moon property but not bad.I love this hotel for its location.  I can overlook some of the faults, and I still like it, but this particular trip wasn't great...The good stuff:  The hotel is right on the market, in the middle of the best part of downtown.  The hotel is quaint, with a nice courtyard and a lot of roomy suite-style rooms.  The service is good, and very friendly.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.The bad stuff:  Our room overlooked a roof and windows into the next door restaurant.  No view, and not great for privacy.  The front room of the suite has no natural light, which makes it very dingy.  The bathroom is tiny.On top of that, we had a couple bad things.  Our A/C unit was leaking water, which soaked the carpet (and luckily not our stuff).  We had to put up with some repairs and a blower running in our room to dry the carpet.  That was a pain.  We also had a bad room service experience on check-out day.  We ordered breakfast in the room to save time so we could get to the airport.  We were told 25-30 minutes.  I called to check after nearly an hour and was told the order was ""on the way.""  They called back 5 minutes later to clarify our order--showing it hadn't yet been started.  When it finally arrived the food was good -- but about an hour later than it should have been, which cramped our schedule.I still like the DoubleTree and will go back, but this particular time (maybe my fourth visit?) was not the best.This is the perfect location to stay when you visit Charleston! You can walk to anything and everything. Plus, the valet service (required, $25/day) includes as many pick-ups and drop-offs as you'd like. So, it's easy to go do things a little ways out of town. The staff is more friendly than most hotel staff I've encountered in the States. And, as you may know from other Doubletree Hotels- you get warm delicious chocolate chip walnut cookies upon arrival! :)Have fun!AWFUL!!Awkward room, stained sheets, broken equipment, worst housekeeping and terrible customer service are some of the qualities of this hotel!We had a bad stay at this hotel but what happened after our stay was over the top. We forgot a book which had sentimental value to me. We noticed it 2 hours after we checked out and immediately called the hotel. I remembered exactly where I forgot and gave specific instructions to the hotel. They said they'd call back later in the day. Next day we called to check status and had supervisor tell us housekeeping manager was off yesterday so they'll talk today and get back to me. Next day ""I"" called and still no progress... After 1 week my husband demanded to talk to the hotel GM. He was responsive. He ""investigated"" but told us that they took all the right steps and we were wrong implying that we were lying in order to get points and offered a lousy 1000 points to make up for it. After we got offended and furious he said he can do 3000 points (1 night = 50000 points). Totally insulting!! We got mad, told the GM to call if he was going to be seriously trying to work things out and never heard back. Every level of leadership in this hotel is disrespectful and Charleston must be a desperate city for this awful hotel to remain in business and still charge over $200 a night. *For further information continue to read below.The Renaissance hotel was over sold so they sent us here to stay. The price is not cheaper although the quality is definitely lower. We were really tired and in need of a decent place which is downtown to crash, so we didnt really have a choice. We stayed at one of the town houses. That was the most ridiculous room I have ever stayed. The room was tiny and the layout was more than weird. Where should I start..There were old stains on the sheets. We had to tweak the tv's antenna cable to be able to watch it. The phone located in the upstairs was broken. When you missed the housekeeping service , all they do is to leave two towels and toilet paper in a trash bag in front of your door. The housekeeping is so inattentive that they didn't even picked out the filled feedback form that is left on the table before us.The only good thing about this hotel is the cookies that they serve when you check in.This is definitely a great choice if you're looking to be close to all the happenings!I stayed here with a bachelorette party and we were able to walk to meals, bars, shops, and a  farmers market. I'm not super familiar with Charleston (read: not at all), but this seemed to be a pretty central location and it met our needs for the weekend.We stayed in two suites, each with two double beds and a pull out couch, which was comfortable for our group of 9.  We did five in one, four in the other, and I was in the room with five and it never once felt too crowded. Granted, we didn't spend a ton of time in the hotel, but for the time we did spend at the Doubletree, it suited our group perfectly.It's nothing fancy, but it was clean (super important) and in a great location. Also, the staff was really on top of it when called for a cart to bring our bags down prior to departure. Seriously, they were at our room no more than five minutes after we called down. If you're looking for a home base for a fun weekend, this is a great option.I stayed here with my mother, my wife and my 7-month old son from 11/24/14 - 11/26/14.  We read reviews that suggested we stay in the bi-level suite, so that's what we went with.  If you're traveling with one other person, this may be a suitable option.  However, the upstairs is simply a loft with 2 double beds, so there isn't a door to separate the upstairs from the downstairs.  Also, the downstairs area was extremely cramped and the ceilings were very low.  On top of all of this, we had problems with our AC.  I called maintenance and reported the issue, only to have them replace the air filter and tell me the problem was resolved.  Needless to say, the next morning our AC was still not working.  I reported the problem and guest services ""upgraded"" us to another suite that wasn't bi-level and did have a separate room.  This room was much better and I wish we had stayed in this room to begin with.  On top of switching our room, I was able to get the hotel to comp us on our breakfast at their restaurant and also comp our $25/day parking fee.  To summarize - this wasn't a terrible hotel as it was conveniently located to the Market and King Street, as well as providing adequate comps to cover the issues we had staying here.  However, I probably would choose to stay somewhere else next time.Perfect location with warm and friendly staff. I stayed here with my family and had a wonderful rest. Room is large enough and very comfortable.You can reach all the best restaurants by walk.Strongly recommended.Wow! Got upgraded to a suite after booking an incredible deal on Priceline. Valet parking is reasonable, especially with the attendants willing to get your car at any moment. The central location is spectacular: 2 blocks to the water and adjacent to the street markets.Terrific, friendly service and ambience from the time you valet your car at check in until the moment you check out of the hotel. Suites are small, but beds are extremely comfortable. Breakfast is satisfying. Order eggs any style from the waiter. In and out privileges with car parked by valet.This is in the best location. I had a great room and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Although I was here for work I unfortuently was not able to enjoy the ourdoor market right out the door. I hear it is amazing. Tons of restaurants/bars/shops in walking distance.I want to give this property a 3.5. Great location, friendly staff (minus breakfast personnel), good room, disappointing bathroom, disappointing breakfast experience. I used partial points for this leisure stay and we were welcomed with typical friendly staff, warm cookies, and an upgrade to a slightly larger room (I think we went from a room with 2 beds and a sofa to a jr. sweet, which gave us an extra TV and  separate bed/living rooms. We found the beds comfortable and were pleasantly surprised that our street-facing rooms didn't mean there was unwanted noise (yay not facing Meeting or Market St.). The furniture in the sitting room wasn't exciting or especially nice, but it was clean &amp; comfortable enough. I'm not a fan of housekeeping stopping by in the evening to leave hard candy, but if you are you are in luck.The bathroom set-up featured the separate toilet and shower/tub with the sink out in the open. I appreciated that the sink was not one of those ridiculously high models that I find in lots of remodeled properties (ugh) and it had plenty of space for two people to unpack. The shower/toilet room was small and as is often the case with this sort of setup there was nowhere to put your stuff while showering by which I men my glasses and clean clothing. I hate resting those things on the tank of the commode. The breakfast buffet was flat out poorly managed. M-F it ends at 10am and on day 1 we arrived around 9-9:30. Ours was included, so the hostess had to check her list(s) for our name &amp; room number. There seemed to be at least two if not three different lists of guests she was checking for our name as the printouts appeared to be formatted differently on the different piles of papers she had. Doubletree: this is not working. A line of people built up behind us. Can we get this staff member a tablet OR just a single list?? Then, we had to wait a few minutes to be assigned a table because although there were empty tables, they had not been cleared or set-up. Doubletree: you need to invest in a busboy for your breakfast service. The waitstaff were obviously overwhelmed by getting people coffee and the very few items they might have requested that were not on the buffet. On day two I wised up and grabbed my own coffee from the service in the lobby as we waited for a table to be cleared. The food on the buffet was unevenly restocked. On day one there was almost nothing on the buffet because it hadn't been replenished (don't worry, I was able to get 3 of the final 6 pieces of bacon). There was some food - cereal, baked goods - but not much else and what was there was minimal and obviously in need of refilling since there were still guests coming in behind us waiting to be seated. Forget requesting a refill on your coffee or water. Just get it yourself from the beverage service in the lobby. I'm not a huge breakfast person, so I rarely go out for it and do not think of myself as overly picky about breakfast service. If you won't hire enough staff to ensure there are clean tables AND coffee and other things are delivered you should almost just downgrade to a serve &amp; bus yourself breakfast room like a lower level property would have. The set-up here could not handle busy late weekday mornings. Bellhops were available when we needed them (to store our luggage) and the taxi they ordered for later in the day was waiting for us as promised. They make use of a nicer grade of taxi service too, which is nice (I don't take that for granted). Thank you for making our departure smooth and providing great service to restore our faith in the property's service.Overall, I'm really glad I had enough points to cover the cost of half of our stay because it is a more expensive part of Charleston to stay and because of the segments that were a disappointment.You know how you always receive a survey after staying at a property? Yeah, I didn't get one of those, which leads me to believe that the management is less concerned with folks' feedback on this property because it is newer and in a great location. Yes, we have come to the day when not receiving a survey makes people suspicious.I just stayed here this past weekend and was blown away by the excellent service and clean rooms, as well as the location.As soon as I walked in, the curteous, welcoming staff welcomed me at the door with smiles and were very accomodating. I asked last minute if I would be able to use my Hilton points, and they helped me work with Hilton Honors to make this last minute change. They also upgraded me for the weekend- woo hoo!My room had a pretty good view of Downtown Charleston from the top floor with lots of natural light. Everything was really comfortable and the room was extremely clean. The hotel is valet parking only, but at $22 (compared to the $20+ for self parking anywhere around the area) it was extremely worth it. The valet were extremely friendly and curteous, always offered to help with bag (if we had any), and it was so nice to be able to just walk out the door to our car instead of trekking to it (it was pretty rainy the weekend we visited).Breakfast here was so-so. There are so many wonderful restaurants in Charleston that I'd really recommend going somewhere else. The staff was friendly, but the food was only okay. We tried it on the first morning as it was complimentary with our stay that weekend, but opted for other breakfast places on the other days.Location of this hotel, as everyone else has stated, is PRIME. It's right next to City Market and only a short walk away from everything else downtown. We only used our car to go to Mt. Pleasant, across the bridge. Seriously, everything is so close- the waterfront, tons of restaurants/bars, shops, art galleries, churches.....the list goes on.The location and service of this hotel is what really make it. I felt so welcome and comfortable- I'd return in a heartbeat. Fantastic.This a great location if you want to walk around and enjoy downtown Charleston.  The fact that they offer valet parking in their private garage which saves you from driving around looking for parking is benefit enough to stay here!!It is expensive, especially during the holiday weekend we stayed here, but in my mind it was worth it to be close to everything.  And, it was in line with the price of all the nearby hotels.The room we had with a king bed felt small, as the bed took up most of the room but it was nice overall.Our party of 4 adults and 3 kids booked this through Priceline.  We got a fabulous price and were in a terrific location.  The employees were helpful in helping the Hubs &amp; Brother find a parking space for our ginormous SUV.  Still, the cleanliness of the suite left something to be desired.  It could've been cleaned a little better.As for as location and price...TERRIFIC!!  Just make sure the room is cleaned better.I have been a long time Hilton Honors member, as well as an owner with Hilton Grand Vacation Club.  My family and I have stayed at many Hilton brand hotels over the years and have never had an issue like the one we just experienced at the Doubletree Hotel on Church Street in Charleston, SC. My husband and I stayed one night on Friday, July 26th, 2013. When we received the bill, there was a $1 charge for a ""Charleston Police Fund Donation."" When I inquired at the front desk about this forced donation, I was informed that the franchise owner of the hotel was on the board of this organization, and he advised the front desk personnel that they were to charge every customer this fee. Furthermore, I was told that they were not required to ask permission or even inform the customer about the charge. Of course, if a customer complained, the charge would be removed. It is my understanding that posting an unauthorized charge to someone's credit card is against the law. However, that is what just occurred at this hotel.  I'm not questioning the value of this organization, and I'm not going to go broke over a dollar. However, using your position as a hotel owner to ""steal"" money from your customers is not legal, ethical, or justifiable. As a Hilton franchisee, this reflects on the Hilton name. I am appalled that Hilton would allow this type of illegal activity. Forcing every patron to donate to your choice of charitable organization by way of an unauthorized credit card charge is not ok!Very pleasant fabulous location. Breakfast staff very polite and welcomingWent here for a weekend get away. The hotel is situated just next to market street and on the beautiful church street in Charleston. The hotel has a great front desk service that are very friendly and helpful organizing dinners, ... The rooms are roomy and we had a split room with living-room and bedroom.  The living room is small but convenient. We had a good bed that is comfortable to sleep in. The cleaning of the bathroom was questionable. The bathrooms are also a bit dated. One get s the sense that this was once a great hotel, but management is really not on top of operations. The hotel has happy hours 5-7 everyday, but it is not much of a bar. There is no pool, ....  so be prepared. This is a place to sleep!They have a breakfast buffet, that is OK but the selection is limited. For anything extra you have to order from the kitchen and the service is SLOW. Like waiting 15 minutes for a plain omelet. Could be a good experience if they tried  a little harder.So still continuing with the Charleston weekend, we had to have some place to crash, but I was surprised by the Doubletree on a few fronts.  First, it was expensive....like NYC prices?!?!?! I realize this place is smack dab in the middle of everything but this is Charleston.....So let's talk about what they don't have..........they doesn't have a pool????  They don't have a rooftop deck area?????  But do give you a warm cookie if you ask nicely? And the cookies are actually good.The rooms...at least the ones we stayed in were like little townhomes.  Two stories with only 1 bathroom, 2 beds and a pull out bed from the couch downstairs.Valet service is available which in a town with very little available street parking I'd recommend you take advantage of it.From the hotel you are steps away from the Market and close to everything.  I found out later there are plenty of nicer hotels and B&amp;B (which includes breakfast and afternoon cocktails) that are in this hotels price range, so if you are going to stay in Charleston/Battery proper just upgrade as you'll get nicer accommodations and more perks at or around the same price.-Perfect location for tourists-Excellent concierge, valet, and front-desk staff service-Terrible housekeeping service (rude, aggressive, unorganized, inefficient)-Did I mention the location?-Rooms are OK - we had a suite in the courtyard (first time my hotel room has had an upstairs bedroom)-Water pressure was weakI'm a Hilton hotel fan, so I try to stay in Hilton-brand hotels as much as possible, hence this particular stay.  If this hotel was in another location, I probably wouldn't be back.Eh....great location, but that's about it....Stayed here last month for a work function.  The rooms were average - could use some updating as I've stayed in newer, much nicer Doubletree's before.  Rooms are also VERY small - at least mine was.  The bathroom vanity was outside of the bathroom, near the bed...strange.  Beds were comfy, stay was quite which I always appreciate.  The biggest challenge of this place is the layout.  It's quite a walk from the room to the valet section to get your car - valet space is also very small and only 1-2 guys working, so expect to wait for your car.  The doors from the outside going in are VERY narrow....made it quite difficult to get in with your suicases.  I appreciate that it's an older building thus narrow doors, possibly odd layout, but found it annoying for me stay.  Overall not bad for the price and location.","This hotel has an amazing location in the historical district of Charleston.  5 stars for the location.  I found the service here to also be great.  I stayed here for a week, and by the end of the week, the staff working in the restaurant made a point to know my name!There are tons of great restaurants in walking distance around the hotel. There are also plenty of cool things to see around the area, and these are all within walking distance of this hotel.The only negatives here are the high price. You pay a pretty high price for a small room, but in my opinion, the location is worth putting up with the  smaller room. I also found that the wifi was very slow, but that still wasn't enough to upset me. If you have never been to Charleston before, I highly recommend staying here!We took a quick trip to Charleston and with only about a week's notice and a lot of things were booked. I looked at a lot of hotels like French Quarter Inn, Charleston Place and some B&amp;Bs and they are were 250 and up a night. Some of the other hotels (Holiday Inn etc) were booked. So, we stayed here even though the reviews on Yelp are horrible (trip advisor was a little better).  The price here was $80 less a night. Here was my experience on the things I dealt with. We had a true suite. There was a room with a couch, chair desk, table, mini bar, fridge etc with lots of room. The bedroom was spacious. The bathroom was really small, but I can live with that. I was a little nervous because we were on the ground floor and I hoped that people going to the bars and walking around, but I never heard anything. The room was clean. Parking was bit pricey but whatever. It's 17-20 at lots of hotels in places with limited parking. The valets were really quick and I didn't have to wait long for them to bring my car around. The lack of a pool kind of sucks, but knew that going in (can still wish though right?). Basically, you're paying for location. The location is close to everything in the historic district. I didn't watch TV at all, but thought it was odd that the living room had a tube TV and the bedroom had a flat panel. Would have expected some continuity. There was an odd noise (somewhat mechanical) coming from below. I have no idea what it was but it wasn't loud enough for me to complain, but if you're a light sleeper, make sure you aren't on the first floor. Overall, it was fine but I will probably stay at one of the super nice hotels next time.Other than the location the hotel is very non-descript. The price of almost 300 bucks a night is extremely high for the quality and cleanliness of the room.  Please get some mildew remover for the bathroom. I had a bi-level suite that opened onto the courtyard. The bathroom and vanity were too small for much of anything. There is no room for luggage in the upstairs bedroom. The noise from adjoining rooms was extremely loud.  I appreciate historic hotels--but they can and should be in immaculate condition. With all of that said--the location of the hotel was amazing. The staff was polite.  However, even though I am a die-hard Hilton guy, I will likely not stay again at this tired and dated Hilton property when I go back to Charleston unless the price is more in line with its quality.Clean comfortable rooms get them 3 stars.  Abysmal service deducts two.  No one offers to carry bags.  No help finding room (in ancillary building).  Building very difficult to find, and person on phone provided no help.  Whoever runs this place needs to be fired, stat.Wifi didn't work.  Person at front desk said they would call back.  Never did.  Eventually figured it out.  Of course, they jam you $10 for access.  (Whatever, it's an excise tax on those who work.)I may have had higher expectations than this place deserved.  With the word ""suites"" in the name, I would have thought the rooms would have a fridge at least.  Not mine.  Even though I got an upgrade, it seems to only have given me a balcony in which the door would not open fully on due to how shallow it was.  Could barely fit, and it overlooked an alley.  Thanks for the upgrade.The people were nice, the room average, the air/heat loud, the TV changed channels slowly, the hot water could boil peanuts,  and the coffee maker was on a tiny stand that would make you laugh.  I promise to upload a photo some day.  For the money, stay elsewhere.   I will next time.Although a bit on the pricey side for event weekends (like the Cooper River Bridge Run), this hotel is located right in the heart of the historic district and within walking distance to the market, fantastic shopping and great restaurants. And with a free warm cookie upon arrival, how could we possibly complain?Our room was plenty big for two people, very clean, and had a small balcony. Obviously with this being the historic district, the buildings are on top of each other so not a great view, but come on - why would you book a room in the historic district and expect one? Get outside and walk around; so much to see/eat/buy, so little time!There are a ton of restaurants within a one block walk and a tiny bar area within the hotel that serves breakfast in the morning and drinks the rest of the day (we couldn't get into any of the rooftop bars due to the CRBR crowd, so went back to the hotel and sat in the courtyard where Chris, the bartender, served us drinks in the afternoon - bonus - no crowds and spectacular service!). Free coffee/hot tea in the morning and a Dunkin Donuts right around the corner if you want to grab a cheap breakfast before embarking on your day of activities. Only (minor) complaint was that the temperature in our room kept getting hot and cold without touching the thermostat; guessing because it's an old building and not enough to deter us from staying there again. Be sure to take advantage of the valet parking. Might seem steep at $20 a day, but they are quick to get your car and parking is at a minimum in this area.Room was clean, the front desk was friendly immediately offering directions for our dinner reservations and bringing out a map for us. Our car was unpacked for us and our bags brought to our room by an extremely polite and helpful young man.Could the couch in our room be upgraded, yes but that's my only negative comment.  The Bed is very comfortable and the location is amazing. We are already discussing adding another night to our stay we are so happy.Charleston is my favorite southern city. The hotel's location in historic Charleston is amazing. We had a problem with our suite being on 2 floors and with the way the front desk initially responded. But I was very happy when a manager contacted me and then compensated me for the problem. I certainly will stay at this hotel again.Very close to the Market.  Excellent base to walk and see downtown.  There are various rooms here,  Some two room, some single rooms.  Mostly remodeled now.  With nice TV's.  Can not beat the freee cookies.Parking is expensive is really the only downside.Loved this hotel...and it was because of the customer service we received. A group of my friends stayed here for the bridge run and the hotel is nice and in a good location. Unfortunately there was an issue with the hot water. While this was inconvenient, the hotel went above and beyond to fix the issue and covered our room rate for the entire weekend. You don't get that type of service these days. I will definitely go back in the future.Under construction. Loud banging and construction workers as my view during the day. Also a strong paint remover smell permeating the lobby and halls all day. My other complaint is noise! I can hear every word my neighbors say in the living room part of my suite. Planned on putting my toddler in that room at night and it isn't working out.Location is great though and the staff is friendly. Room is clean but a bit worn and the bathroom is tiny and really like the bathroom of a 1 star hotel....cracks everywhere, a hospital quality shower curtain that leaks and floods the bathroom....Okay if you are just concerned about location. I don't think I'll be back.Stayed for 3 nights.  3 stars for the room, 1 star for the service.Room:-Clean-Comfortable bed-Small bathroom, poor water pressure-Suite with pull out couch was perfect for our family of four.-Paper thin walls = one of the noisiest rooms I have ever stayed in.  I could literally follow conversations from the room next to me.Service-Really, $10/day for internet access??  Ridiculous.  -Despite the hotel knowing that we had 4 people in our room, every day we got 3 bath towels and every day I had to call to request more.-Every day had to call to receive the paper that was part of my room rate.  Was not delivered once.-Took 25 minutes to get help with luggage and our car ($22/day to park) when we checked out.  Was told they lost our request.-Did not get the promised turn down service for the entire stay.Basically, the location of this hotel is superb.  But despite that, I would not stay here again.  There are other options and the Doubletree was a disappointment.This ended up being a great place to stay!  It was smack down in the middle of it all in Charleston, SC!  We were able to valet the car and walk to everything.  I really liked the rooms since they were suites.  Perfect if you were staying with another couple or a group of friends and wanted to separate the rooms and have some sort of privacy.  We ended up with a fantastic king suite facing the front of the hotel and had a beautiful view of the city.  The sunlight filled the bedroom and living room and it was very clean.  It was nice to have access to two TVs as well as a mini fridge to store perishable food.If I had to complain about anything it would be the small bathroom and the 8:00 bang on the door from housekeeping.  Besides that, everything was perfect and I enjoyed the free warm Chocolate Chip Cookies at check-in!The Doubletree was a bit pricey, especially considering I've stayed in luxurious boutique hotels in Chicago and Atlanta for LESS.  They even make you pay an unreasonable amount for internet access!!  I notice many upper echelon hotels are making people PAY for something that SHOULD be included with the room (especially at the price point).  WiFi is a way of life these days, not a luxury.  That said, we always got clean towels, a thorough housekeeping job on the room and very nice valets/bellmen.  It's close to many different attractions and the location is pretty primo.  The venue still needs some updating and improving, and definitely a good polishing.  Upon observation the environment,  objects, walls, railings, even the steel in the elevators appeared, dirty, worn and dingy.  I also would like to see if they could inject some air conditioning in the elevators, it's only a few second ride, nonetheless you're workin' up a sweat until those doors open (especially in that Charleston heat).  I didn't really spend too much time in the facility, since I was busy with all my Spoleto itinerary.  I would say the Doubletree is definitely a nice place to stay when visiting the area, but I have a feeling there are nicer and friendlier accommodations for the money spent here.  I'll be looking for a B &amp; B or something a bit more charming and personal when I return.  However, that said, I will point out that when I was checking out, I got to see a certain celebrity chef checking in, so it's gotta be pretty good.Yep, it's expensive. What'd you expect? It's a Doubletree. It's in a premium down town location. No, parking ain't cheap -- $20 plus tip valet; $14 self park around the corner on Hayne Street (not owned by the hotel). Again what'd you expect? Of course like many nicer hotels there's a $10 per day charge for wi-fi (although I suspect Hilton Honors members might be able to get that fee waved with a ""Hilton HHonors Guest Pass"" I received a pass because I was there on a negotiated group rate, and our negotiator got free access for all of us, and the above phrase was on the log-in information card. If you belong to HHonors I think you should ask.) Does that cover the typical complaints?  NOw to the good stuff.The staff could not have been nicer and more friendly, whether I approached them at their work stations or passed them in the hall. From the person who met our car and offered to carry our bags to the cleaning crew, all seemed glad we were there. I had a wonderful room in the newer added-on building. You get there by walking across a large interior courtyard. I think you'd get damp crossing it in the rain, because there is no completely covered path from the main building to this one.Room had a hi-def TV attached to a Comcast box (I understand from someone else at the meeting that is not the TV option in the main building). Initially it did not work. A call to the front desk and a gentleman from engineering arrived to check it out in less than 5 minutes. Turned out problem was just some loose wires between the cable box and the TV. Quickly repaired. Football game on!The hotel location was supreme. We could easily walk to anything in the downtown tourist area--which of course was part of the high room cost. Would I stay again? yes. Would I think it was darned expensive? you bet. But I got what I paid for.Outrageous price for what you get.  It is advertised as ""suites"" but I had an ordinary, small hotel room...no fridge, no room for a sofa, absolutely not a suite.  No pool.  No restaurant.  No bar.  For that kind of money I would have at least expected that.  No airport shuttle.  But great location.  The staff, friendly and accomodating.I would not stay here again.  Outrageous price for the low level of what you receive.I have loved doubletree for their roomy suites- meaning two rooms- breakfast included and a nice pool. This hotel featured none of those. A small but comfortable room but in this heat a pool would have been a welcomed relief. Also what is the deal with having to pay for wireless?! For nearly $200 per night, why isn't it included?I was doing a southern road trip with my best friend. Charleston was next on our agenda. We had been so happy with the trip so far. We arrived at the hotel at about 2pm. Valet was confusing as there was no sign and valets were not around. At front desk our room wasn't ready until 4. I understand check-in wasn't until 4 anyway, but staff was rude and somewhat cold. When we did get in the room it was beautiful but the hotel layout was very confusing. They had redone an old building in the back and this is were the room was located. The old building had a terrible smell and seemed dirty. When we went to the concierge to purchase a tour he seemed more concerned with his dinner plans over his cell phone rather than helping us. When retrieving our car to drive to the beach the valet was rude and short. When handing me my keys he held out his other hand waiting for the tip. To top all of this off, when we did check out I noticed $2 on my bill for the Charleston police department fund. Now this is only $2 and I have no problem giving to the police department but to not even ask and to add this to my bill... Once I brought this to front desk she responded with a ,""yeah yeah,"" and removed it. Makes me think how many people don't check there receipts. I'm sure there are good workers but the staff that we encountered was rude and seemed to be annoyed to be bothered with customers. I will never stay at this hotel again and would suggest to everyone to choose another place to stay.Decent location downtown, but considering how expensive it is, you get a lot more for your money at other locations that are within blocks of this hotel.  For instances, Embassy Suites is only a few blocks away, is generally about $10 cheaper, has more room, has a fridge in the room, has a pool, free breakfast and happy hour.  The last time time I stayed here, the light switch in the bathroom did not work.  i let them know the first night, but five days later, still not fixed.  The parking is completey unsatisfactory.  If often took at least ten minutes to get my car in the morning -- this would be ok if they were busy, but in the a.m.s, I was often the only one in 'line', but apparently they need a line to get moving?  Do not get why this hotel is so expensive for what little if offers.  in addition to the Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn, and several local hotels are withing blocks of this place so location does not justify the price.",,,"['years', 'ago', 'memorial', 'weekend', 'place', 'zoo', 'nonetheless', 'centrally', 'located', 'fun', 'stuff', 'historic', 'value', 'good', 'southern', 'hospitality',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/charleston-marriott-charleston,Charleston Marriott,3.0,$$$,59,"Thanks to Marriott Rewards program for 2 free nights at this location. It's not walking distance from the downtown restaurant/fashion/antique districts, but it met our requirements just fine. So, know that there is very little nearby, but you can walk to the river area and view that from the rooms. Since it was a weekend, they gave us breakfast each day for free. Whew!While the hotel itself needs some updating and care on the outside (I saw rusted out areas and some needing paint from the window). Also, the bathroom is incredibly small. I'm surprised they didn't redo the shower. Not what I would have expected from a Marriott, but our stay was free, so I won't complain. Otherwise, it's well decorated.We had dessert and breakfast in the restaurant. My biggest suggestion is they need to do something about acoustics in there. It was insanely loud, especially when kids were running around or busy. Lastly, we got left by the shuttle driver downtown (long story), but I'd encourage you to get there very early or they may take off before the designated pick up time. Thankfully, the hotel manager took care of that situation for us, which was very kind.We booked this hotel for a wedding over the 4th of July weekend.  The hotel wasn't located downtown, but there was a free shuttle that ran every hour for guest would wanted to venture out. Unfortunately, we arrived in the afternoon so we did not get to take advantage of this service.The hotel nice and the rooms were clean and spacious! We had a 2 year old and needed a pak and play and the staff accommodated us quickly.  The bed was really comfortable and I really liked that the thermostat was really quiet. Nothing worse than coming into a hotel with a separate air conditioning unit!We ordered room service for dinner and breakfast the following morning- the prices were very reasonable and delivery was very quick! The food was surprisingly really good. I dared to get the crab cake and it did not disappoint! I like that the standard egg order came with orange juice and coffee!The pool was great, it was clean and not over crowded.All in all, it was a nice overnight stay and I would recommend it to anyone. I wish it was downtown as it was a little hassle that I couldn't take my son to walk around, getting him in the shuttle and down there would have been tough especially if he had a meltdown and I was stranded without a way to get back to the hotel- in hindsight, I guess I could have gotten Uber to get me back...I stayed here with a group of friends for the weekend of July 4th. The hotel is not located in downtown Charleston but about 2 miles away near MUSC. The hotel was super busy since it was the holiday weekend and they had a cookout on the 4th but everything was well overpriced such as $7 for a burger or a sandwich. I expected decent pricing if not reduced prices for hotel guests at a nicer hotel for a special occasion. When I originally booked my reservation, I requested a rollaway bed since there were 4 of us and some people wanted their own bed. At the time of check-in, the front desk was unaware of this request and did not have any confirmation which has never been issue before since I am elite member that has had countless stays. Anyways, I requested it again and they replied that it would be up there shortly. A few hours later, there was still no rollaway bed so I went down and asked again getting the same response. Later that day after we explored Charleston, we came back and there was still no rollaway. I went down and explained the issue once again and was very frustrated at this point but all I received was an apology. It was a terrible experience but I finally received my rollaway bed after asking in person 3 times which is completely unacceptable.On a positive note, the hotel had a free shuttle that ran every 30 minutes to downtown which drops off right in from of Waterfront Park. The previous reviews stated that it cost money but it was free of charge so I am not sure if the policy changed or it was a special for the holiday weekend. That was convenient so we didn't have to try to find parking and drive ourselves downtown at all. As for the breakfast, they had the standard hot foods and pastries along with an omelet bar, waffle station, and made to order eggs. They also had a nice variety of fruit but nothing special as they didn't have smoked salmon nor juice shots as I have had at other Marriotts. Overall, it was a below average stay because it took forever to get my room set up but luckily we weren't in the room much except for sleeping. Expected better service from a Marriott but unfortunately it just wasn't there this time.Convenient location to MUSC and the Children's hospital.  They have a special rate as well for ppl doing business or with family in the hospital, ask about it.  The staff is very friendly.  The hotel is clean and what you would expect from a Marriott.  They have a sundry shop, concierge lounge, bar, restaurant and coffee/pastry counter.  It appears they just renovated.  There is a great outdoor area by the bar with fire pits and comfortable seating.I was not there for a meeting, but they had a good amount of meeting space.They have free parking as well.  They are not far from the hustle bustle, restaurants, history of downtown Charleston. If you are a Marriott Reward member you can get free wi-fi in the guest room and you can sign up at arrival if you are not a member.this marriott was not within walking distance to downtown, but we were unable to move closer.  there must have been a convention or something going on.but we did find perks to this place.  if you are a gold member...free wi-fi and there is a concierge lounge that we took advantage of.   the lounge had nibbles, coffee and a free breakfast.   you can order drinks, which get charged to your room.  during my stay, there was a super friendly hostess, who was able to point out some places to hit during our stay.   she gets the 4th star for this hotel.   the rooms were clean and spacious.   my view wasn't much to rave over and the windows fogged up with condensation.  still, it was a pretty good value.This is a beautiful hotel with lots of potential. Roof top bar is excellent. Unfortunately, they are understaffed and that can be annoying. The front desk supervisor, Danny, does all he can to be professional and accommodating. He is a asset to the hotel but he can only do so much. The cleaning staff do a nice job but are loud and unaware that their boisterous conversations in the hall disturb people who are not leaving or want peace and quiet in the morning. The room service food is outstanding. We noticed they are understaffed also, the manager brought our food one morning.  This hotel is NOT downtown. I still think that it is a very nice property with mad potential. If management focused on these key factors, I would stay here every time I visit Charleston which is monthly.Fantastic stay for the weekend, it does require a quick car ride to the historic district.  There is a shuttle service provided by the hotel or taxis which stay outside. Love entertainment on the rooftop bar on the weekends, pool is clean but does get crowded. We spent our time there mostly in downtown, the breakfast is great (ours was included in our stay, I do not know how much it is individually). There is a Starbucks, a patio area that is ground level with shaded areas, parking later on the evening can be tight. Safe parking lot and well lit.Great conference hotel. Easy check in, good service! Bars and restaurants have good food. Very accommodating!We booked this hotel as it offered the most reasonable rate over a major holiday.The level of service was excellent - from the registration desk, bellman, shuttle driver to the bartenders.  The decor in the lobby area was very attractive.  There is a spacious patio with comfortable furniture to enjoy also.  Our room was nicely decorated and comfortable.  The bathroom decor had been updated but the tub area appeared to be original.  Seems they should have updated that too when upgrading the rest of the room.  Also, condensation appeared in the windows but neither of these interfered with the comfort of our stay.A little out of the way in terms of the historic district but they have a complimentary shuttle that runs every 1/2 or so and the drivers were great about accommodating you.After reading the reviews on several sites I decided to call it home for a week while working  in Charleston.  The rooms are clean  but was just never able to feel relaxed. The restaurant is mediocre at best and be prepared to finance your bar tab if you have a few drinks and a meal. Servers are inattentive and didn't bring salads or appetizers. They did offer to remove them from the bill after we asked about them several times. Drink prices are outrageous so buyer bewareNicely updated hotel. Love the rooftop bar. The staff is very helpful and pleasant. They have a shuttle downtown thst is s plus. You don't have to take your car for the entire stay, which is a plus. There is a fee for the shuttle, which i wasn't informed of when i checked in, i think they should do a one time fee for your stay, but the charge  is $7 per day per person which is a lot. I think overall I would stsy again.This hotel was terrific. All the staff were so friendly and smiley. The coffee shop lady went above and beyond. The restaurant had great choices and the rooftop bar was a great bonus. There's a shuttle that will take you downtown and the pool area looked pretty chic itself. Those pillows I wanted to take with me. I'd always stay here if I were visiting back.Dinner was deliscious, crab cakes. Friends had she crab soup and ribeye with Mac and cheese. Waiters were attentive. No wait.Beautiful hotel, fabulous staff, comfy room, great view. We booked thru <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a>. Perhaps we could have grabbed that rate directly with the hotel;they were so accommodating. They upgraded us to a corner room with windows facing two directions and great views. Manager (Mr Till), clerk (Richard), and bellman (Dan) all great service.This is the worst Marriott I have ever stayed in. Checked in, received 2 rooms, and both smelled like cigarette smoke. One of the two rooms had a mold smell that just hit you in the face as soon as you walk in through the door. The receptionist put us in two different rooms 3 floors below our original rooms, and those ALSO smelled like pure smoke. I thought Marriott was a smoke-free hotel in the US! It isn't here. Even the hallways wreak of smoke.The view is also quite awful. Don't be fooled by the ""courtyard view"". If you are above the 2nd floor all you will see is an ugly rooftop with fans. Everything outside your window is all concrete. This hotel is supposed to be waterfront. It's not. Don't come here. Not worth the $339 I was paying a night per room.Does Marriott know that they have this place? It is like corporate forgot about it. I would agree with the reviewer that said it was the worst Marriott they have stayed at. The lobby, bar, and outdoor areas were very nice. My room was on the 6th floor and it looked a little tired. That didn't bother me. The horrible mustiness was a bigger issue for me. It was awful. I realize that it is humid in the south and that things get musty but this was unbearable. Thankfully, I only stayed one night. In the morning the hallway smelled of sewage. The rooms also don't seem to have a door closer on them so you hear slamming all night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The parking, while free, was a problem because the valet had all of the spots near the doors blocked off. You can pay $10 to valet or drag your belongings all the way around the building. The location is not great. Whenever I travel I like to explore the local neighborhood on foot. Not here. I drove around the block to get my bearings and decided that I was just a couple of blocks from an unsafe area. It is also too far to walk to the historic district.Way overpriced for what you get and where it is.Our room was clean and comfortable and had a gorgeous view of the harbor. The drinks at the bar were tasty, strong, and priced well. There are rocking chairs and sofas on the back deck (again with the amazing view) and complimentary coffee in the morning. All of this was wonderful, and we would stay here again. My only complaint is the shuttle to downtown, as the hotel is not in walking distance. My mom paid the $6 for each of us to ride, and the driver never checked our tickets. (Not once, the entire weekend, and we only paid once and rode many times...) We kept getting told different times about pick-ups and drop offs, but no matter when we showed up to catch the shuttle we almost always had a thirty minute wait. In one instance, the shuttle driver was late because he said the hotel made him sweep up outside the lobby. Another time, he almost made us late for our walking tour because he was planning to head back to the hotel to drop his buddy off first (not a hotel guest!) until we complained! Another one of our shuttle drivers gave the double-bird at a fellow motorist who cut us off in traffic. Overall, the shuttle was not an enjoyable experience...I give it only one star! Crappy room Ac didn't work! Not friendly. But it is in a good area!That's all I can sayThe customer service is amazing at this location. From the housekeeping staff to the front desk when Matt greets you by name and remembers your face from before! The staff here go the extra mile to make you feel right at home when staying in Charleston.Great decor in the lobby. Newly redone rooms. Very clean. Walls were a little thin. Only stayed one night but would stay again in the summer to take advantage of the pool and outdoor area.","The decor at the Charleston Marriott is perfect! Bright and cheery southern decor touches make it so charming! My room was comfortable and clean. The staff were all pleasant and helpful. I loved having coffee on the large patio each morning. The only negative is this hotels location, not within walking distance to any restaurants or sites.The last review from ""Alison"" is not the Marriott....... It is the Courtyard Charleston Waterfront hotel.Ugh! We had a group event here for 5 days and absolutely hated the hotel. I am super easy about accomodations and am always happy with a solid Hampton Inn.  This place is just the worst.  The room had so much mildew that I sneezed non-stop. Others in our group complained of the same thing. I am still recovering from staying here and think I have a sinus infection as a result.The place is so tired and worn out - it looks like a cheap Las Vegas hotel circa 1995. The room was in disrepair and I couldn't believe the ironing board when we pulled it out of the closet - it had a destroyed cover that looked 20 years old.It is horribly located - not near anything you would want to see or do in Charleston.  We spent a fortune on taxis everyday. The rooms are tiny (and so are the bathrooms and showers). There are so many other places to stay in Charleston that there is absolutely no point in staying at this Marriott.This is by far the worst Marriott Hotel that we have ever stayed in.  We were in 2 different rooms that both smelled of mold covered up by Febreze.  The room was in need of a face lift.  It needed painting and freshening up.  We spent one night there and checked out the next morning.  We were suppose to stay 3 nights.  I couldn't stand the smell.  We checked into the Hampton Inn in Charleston and really enjoyed out stay.We just got back from staying a few days at this Marriott.   Though it was not really set up for family fun.......   Everyone at this Marriott was very pleasant.  From the drivers to the maids.   Very Clean and The Pool area was very nice and catered to everyone.  I would recommend this to everyone.We were scammed and manipulated by the sales team at Marriot! We will never do business with this particular location ever again! EVER. Also when you stay there look closely at detail and you will see that its not as nice as they claim it is.I only stayed in this hotel for one night while waiting for our rental house to be available on Isle of Palms. It was fine - clean, quiet rooms, convenient Starbucks counter right off the lobby, nice sitting area outdoors. My issue with this hotel started after checkout. I realized an hour or so after we left that I didn't have one of my bags with me. I remembered that I had shoved it into the closet upon check-in the night before and failed to grab it on the way out. I called the hotel to explain what happened, left my name, room #, and my phone number. I expected to receive a call that they had found my game later that day, but no dice. I called again the next day and spoke to another person who had no idea what I was talking about, and I was told that no bags had been reported found in any rooms. Well, I'm positive that I had left the bag in the room, so what could have happened to it? It was a new bag, with a brand new set of sheets and two beach towels in it. It cost me well over $100 to replace everything that was ""lost"". Very disappointed in their customer service and I won't be recommending this particular hotel to any travelers.We held a four-day event here in their Opal and Topaz ballrooms and were very very pleased. The banquet staff was all wonderful, the servers and bellmen were some of the friendliest people I've met, and everyone we encountered did whatever they could to help us with what we needed. I even met a very kind bellman who, when I couldn't find a bicycle rental shop who'd accommodate me, asked his friend's girlfriend to lend me hers so I'd have a chance to explore the city on my break from work. Talk about going above and beyond the call of duty!I'd give it 5 stars if the box lunches we were provided daily weren't so grody. Almost all of our participants mentioned how bad they were and it reflected poorly on us. Also the whole ""pay $9.95 per day for your internet"" thing, but we got around that with the help of a very obliging salesperson.This is a nice place and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  I was overcharged on check out but they quickly corrected the error with a smile.  The room was fine although a bit small.  The breakfast was truly amazing!  The fresh fruit on the buffet were the best!The rooms are small. But the smell of my room is not appealing.I am 100% sure this was a smoking room in the past and they just couldn't cover the smell.The parking is terrible. However, the Concierge lounge it pretty nice... Well if you are a rewards member.very clean, location is not in the heart of downtown or on the beach but not a far cab ride at all. friendlyish staff but need to be a tad more knowledgeable on the area but cabs and shuttles offered at the hotel right away.Disclaimer: I wanted to experience the downtown, historic Charleston area. That's why this hotel gets 2 stars. (Yes, I'm another Hotwire sucker.)Pros: This is a very nice hotel. The lobby and restaurants downstairs are very tastefully decorated and remind me of much nicer hotels I've stayed at in Las Vegas. Saffire's bar is quiet and reasonably-priced, and makes a nice place for a nightcap. The staff was all very friendly. The Daily Grind is open early and closes late, so you can always grab some coffee. The room was decently sized. The hotel was hosting some sort of conference or workshop, and all of those people seemed to be having a good time. Parking in the hotel lots is free and there were always open spaces.Cons: My room (the Hotwire special) turned out to be a wheelchair-accessible room, which only actually mattered in the bathroom. Everything was low, which wasn't that big of a deal for me, but there was no bathtub. It was a shower stall...with no stall. There was a half-inch lip of tile between the shower floor and the bathroom floor...which meant I had to spend time mopping up the floor after each shower. We ended up using the extra towels as additional bathmats. The bathroom also took forever to dehumidify - I'm talking 45-60 minutes with the fan on. So that was strange. The rooftop bar was closed; the desk clerk said that no one goes up there when it's cold. (Temperatures were in the 70s-50s the entire weekend I was there; they lost some money on that decision, I'll bet.) The hot tub, pool, and courtyard were closed for renovations - which seems odd to me, because other reviews I've found suggest that those areas were renovated in 2009? So...too many things were closed. This hotel is NOT downtown. It's a solid two miles from the hotel to King Street. There IS a free trolley (CARTA DASH) with a stop on either side of the hotel, but it only runs until 9  at night (7 on Sundays), so if you want to experience Charleston's nightlife, you'll need to call a cab or hike it. The hotel offers a shuttle ($), but I didn't bother with that. ETA: Oh! They want $10 per day for wifi! That is nuts. And if you've forgotten any of the basics - toothbrush, toothpaste - don't worry, they'll be happy to direct you to the store just off of the lobby, where you can pay $3 for any one of these items. In summation: if you want to walk around Charleston, this is NOT the place for you. If you don't care about cabs or shuttles, this is a really nice place to stay. If they stick you in a room with a wheelchair shower, try to switch.We were duped by Hotwire!  I chose a 4-star hotel in ""downtown"" Charleston and wound up with the Marriott which is located nowhere near downtown.  At the very least, the downtown area should be walkable from the hotel.  Unless 2.5 miles each way is your idea of a convenient walk, you will likely be disappointed.  The hotel is convenient to absolutely nothing except a VA hospital.  Every time we wanted to go into town, we had to drive and waste a bit of time searching for parking.  I know they offer a shuttle from the hotel at $6/person, but it is fairly infrequent and doesn't make sense to take considering there is a free city trolley that they fail to mention, and if we really were downtown, we wouldn't need a trolley in the first place.   The hotel itself was fairly charming in its lobby and common spaces, and doubles as a small convention center.  The rooms were a different matter.  Walking the hallway of our floor, it smelled of shampoo.  There is no circulation at all, so the smell of cleaning fluids lingers about.  In our room, because there was no circulation, our window was beaded with water drops.  It always looked like it was raining outside.  The only time we could get the water drops to clear up was if we kept the room at a very low temperature.  It was all rather inconvenient.  The tiny bathroom that required a maintenance call didn't help matters much.  The downstairs coffee shop had some rather delicious coffee and sold sports drinks which was great, until I saw that the price for 1 coffee and 1 sports drink cost over $6.  Ouch!  The parking and internet were free, so that was cost effective at least.  Breakdown:(room rate) $125/night + (fees) $27.30/night = too much money for the hotel. We actual stayed at the Mill's House via Hotwire for less money than this and had a much, much grander time in the heart of downtown.Great room - great service. You can tell this is the nice hotel in the area. I do wish that it was closer to the downtown area. Not sure if they provide a shuttle but if they do that would be awesome.I was on a business trip - 5 hotels in 5 days and while I think the overall ambiance of the hotel was great there was something lacking in the room but I can't place it right now. Maybe the rooms were a bit dated in comparison to the rest of the hotel. The conference center area is nice but could use some more labeling as people seemed a bit lost of where to go for their events.I think the staff make this a 4 star review. Also Marriott needs to do something about not providing free wireless - it really is a crime at this point.Good place to stay.  Restaurant is ok.  It is a Marriott, so rooms are sort of good size.  Bed is comfortable.  People are nice.  Valet service is enthusiastic,Charleston Marriott, you suck.  You were oversold and couldn't offer me another room when I wanted to switch.  You gave me a musty room without a bathtub.  Your desks are too high to sit at comfortably and I never got that desk insert you promised me.  Your bathwater takes too long to heat up.  The entrance to your terrace bar is ghetto - it looks like an emergency exit with a sticker on it.  Your stairs layout doesn't make any sense and you elevators are slow.  And lastly, you charge a fee for a shuttle downtown when there is a free trolley that stops right by the hotel that you don't tell anyone about.But you have lovely outdoor seating areas with firepits and a nice view of the water.Peace out Marriott.  We had enough and checked out early.Great hotel, quiet, clean.  Staff is friendly not fake friendly, and so helpful.  Great shuttle downtown every half hour for six dollars for the day.  Good location right next to Charleston PD but you would never know they are right next door.  Neighborhood seems safe and quiet.  Downtown is about 2 miles, not really walkable but close.  One of the best places I have stayed in a long time.  Vast amount of parking and well lit, plus free garage parking if desired.  Very well appointed interior of hotel and rooms.Nothing spectacular about this place other than the restaurant and lobby and even that wasn't anything exciting.  Extremely overpriced in my opinion but I think that's pretty par for the Charleston area.  Rooms were clean, yet small and the outdoor patio area was actually a nice little surprise.  My girlfriend and I were here for a wedding reception and the staff running the open bars seemed to be doing a great job filtering the people their drinks and the restaurant did a good job setting up the food, etc.  My suggestion though is that if you have to stay in Charleston, try and stay right down the road in Mt. Pleasant or at least across the bridge and save yourself a good amount of money!I recently stayed here and was quite impressed.  This is a category V Marriott and it felt like it.  The staff were extremely friendly and the building itself was very clean and well maintained.There is a nice outdoor pool area with several fire pits and outdoor seating.  This restaurant has a concierge level and has both a cafe and restaurant onsite.The parking is free and is all around the location.  The hotel is conveniently located on the west side of town so the traffic is nice and light.The next time I visit Charleston I'll certainly be stating here again --a very pleasant stay.Having stayed at many hotels across the country for both business and leisure, I wasn't really sure what to expect out of the Charleston Marriott.  I'd read other reviews that said it was great, and others despised it.  For me, this was a pretty solid hotel for the money, although the location made it less-than-perfect.Let's start with the good - The hotel entrance, lobby and common areas are all very nice places to sit, relax and enjoy a cup of coffee.  Actually, the lobby is one of the nicest Marriott lobbies I think I've come across.  Service was also generally solid, and between the restaurant and coffee shop (which was open late), there are plenty of dining options.The mediocre?  The rooms.  They were fine, but just didn't have the updated feel of the lobby and were generally small.  The biggest drawback, as I mentioned, was the location.  The Marriott is just over 2 miles from the heart of downtown Charleston and a quick bike ride away, but I wouldn't want to walk it.  Alternatively, guests can take a hotel shuttle or a cab for $5/person.  Or, for similar money, you could just stay downtown.  (Not at a high-end B&amp;B, of course.)Despite this Marriott being generally appealing and a decent value, if you're going to stay in Charleston, stay in Charleston.","I wish you had a no star option yelp. The bathroom was all mildew, dim lightbulbs so you don't see all the dirt.....sofa just filty, bed linens torn, stained rug, dirty wet windows. This hotel needs management because the front desk staff and restaurant employees were very hard working. The public areas are comfortable and the outdoor seating is plentiful, nice pool. However one does like a clean room at these rates.Wow, what horrible deal we got through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotwire.com&amp;s=d1b28cf279608588b1b4e17dd9db61331484f85f0a19df039be53a56d65a4076"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotwire.com</a>  this time around.  We also got misled on the location.  We asked for a Downtown hotel and ended up here. This is NOT DOWNTOWN!  You need a car to get downtown or will need to take the FREE TROLLEY down the street.  Do not take their shuttle that they charge for.  Anyway, the hotel is sort of bait and switch by the fact that they have a lovely reception/lobby area complete with to types of spa water that they keep fresh all day long. I LOVE SPA WATER! lol  I make it at home so I thought this was a treat!  Anyway, we get up to our room and the misery began.The hallway on the 7th floor was so stuffy and muggy, it was odd. No air circulation was going through there.  As we opened the door, I almost passed out.  Now, it was cold outside, I should welcome warmth inside my room, but instead, I was greeted with a very muggy almost moldy smelling room and the windows were all fogged up! I had to keep the air conditioning on during our entire stay just so we could breath comfortably in there.  Sure it got cold, but it was the only way.  It was very uncomfortable to be in that room.  Also, the bathroom was very tiny.  For the price we paid even at a discount via Hotwire, this was such a disappointment.  I could barely move around in there. It was outdated and rough.   The toilet broke within a half hour of us even being in the room. Already had to call down for maintenance.  Also had to call for toilet paper at an inopportune time.  Housekeeper missed the mark there. Makes me wonder what else she missed making up the room.   Parking was free, but the spaces closest to the elevator banks were tight and almost never available.  For the most part, we ended up parking all the way in the back just to make sure the car wouldn't get hit and that we had room.  We had to walk through the conference room area to get to the lobby and then the elevator banks. The one other good thing about this place is the coffee.  It was supposed to be Starbucks but it sure did taste A LOT better than Starbucks at the store. I don't know what they are using down there, but it was pretty decent.  They open early and close late so that was nice.   Also, the rooms offer free wifi which is nice, but it's slow and you get knocked offline a lot, but either way, it's free so I can't complain I guess.I would never stay here again.  Also, thanks to this stay at this hotel, I won't be using hotwire again. They tricked me!  The last time we were in Charleston we got the Mill House Hotel!  Now, that's what I'm talking about.  Ughh..never again.Very nice room, excellent service, varied options for brunch.  If I ever return to Charleston, I'll be staying here!For service.  Ok, I get it if the hotel was really busy the night prior.  I get it that you advertise check-in at 4pm.  But unless its Vegas, who ever has to wait til 4 to check in?  Apparently this Marriott doesn't care about the time regardless.  I showed up at 2:55pm to check in, as a Platinum member.  No rooms were available.  Gave them my cell and went and sat in the lobby.  One hour and 45 mins later I went up to the front desk.  Told him how long it has been.  He put me in a room immediately.   I asked why no one called.  He said the room they had for me still wasn't ready.  Are you kidding me?!  Why wouldn't you ask me if I wanted a room or the one they held off for me.  So mad.  And to boot --- no apology whatsoever, or even acknowledgement that I am upset about all of this.Stayed here 4 nights for a mix of business and vacation. The best thing about this hotel is the people. The front desk staff and attendants are all excellent - very helpful, friendly, and full of ideas to explore their city. The rooms are on the small side but big enough. We had a beautiful view looking over the marsh lands and Ashley river. The hotel is near the Citadel and the minor league baseball stadium (""River Dogs"").  Downside to the hotel is that it is not within walking distance to the historic district. But the on demand hotel shuttle is super convenient, and the shuttle drivers are all GREAT. The morning breakfast buffet is fantastic!  The daily fresh fruit selection is wonderful. Nice to have a ""we proudly brew"" Starbucks in the lobby too. The common grounds of the hotel are all nice with great outdoor seating, a nice (small) pool and great rooftop bar. Overall, would certainly recommend staying here.Clean, nice and convienent location. Staff was very helpful. The outside patio by the pool is relaxing and beautiful. While some reviews say it eas dated, I would say minimumally, and that care and maintinence were superior and are far more important as was the case. Would stay there again if venturing to Charleston.The hotel is undergoing construction in it's conference area and parking garage area. Parking is a little bit of a challenge, but not enough to hinder a rating.This is a Marriott?  This is a Mariott BY NAME ONLY.  The lobby is nice enough but I couldnt get over how small the rooms were.  I paid $220 for a tiny room with a king-size bed, PAPER THIN walls, dim bathroom (I had to do my makeup in the bedroom).  The towels are tinted green - did someone wash them with some green accidentally???  The staff was nice enough but give me a break.  I will never be back here - pay a little extra and stay at a nicer place in town.K and I stayed at the Charleston Marriott, and it was a mixed experience. As the original reviewer noted, the building color is a 1980s kind of daffodil yellow. Ugh.The remodel being done, however, is taking it in the right direction. The pool area is nicely done, and the lobbies on the first floor are tastefully done and inviting.The view from our room on the 8th floor gave a nice panorama of the river from the left (southeast) to the Citadel on the right. Unfortunately a couple of municipal buildings mar the immediate foreground, but the view is otherwise pleasant.The bellhop, Crosby was pleasant and very helpful in wheeling our many bags upstairs. If you stay here, ask for him by name. The room was pleasant and unremarkable. The mini-fridge was helpful, and the blast of the dual-head shower was a welcome relief after a 5-hour drive from Atlanta. The $10 charge for internet---even in the lobby---was no relief at all. For a $160/night room, they are charging for wireless? In 2009? Really? When I called the front desk and ask if wireless is comped for Marriott Rewards customers, he explained that it is for Gold and Platinum (I'm only silver at the moment). He then asked if I had received my coupon for a free flatbread appetizer.....ummm, yes, but what has that to do with my internet question? *sigh*The front desk's recommendation for dinner was *meh*, but there is an excellent book of restaurant profiles and menus. Rather than ask the desk, I'd suggest flipping through that...or coming to Yelp!Checkout this morning was a Charlie Foxtrot. I called at 10:15 to arrange a bellhop and cart at 10:45. Despite two subsequent visits to the front desk and 30 minutes of waiting, no help came. As we carried our bags to the car, three bellhops stood talking outside. Nice.We might stay here again (convenient location, safe, reasonable cost), but the service was on-again, off-again.Great room and great service...no free wifi which is sad.Have never had a bad experience at this hotel.  Check-in to check-out is wonderful.The restaurant's menu is limited, but what they have is prepared wonderfully!This hotel was absolutely beautiful. I was a little concerned about it, when we first arrived. Maybe it was the cheesy yellow exterior paint color. But I had nothing to be concerned about. The hotel is beautifully decorated, the colors are bright and warm. The staff is very friendly. The beds was firm and the linens were fresh and crisp. I also love the lamp style that Marriott is using in their hotels now. The lamps actually have electrical outlets in the base, for plugging in your cell phone charger or i-pod. It's very nice not having to stand on your head looking for an outlet! Nice hotel, I would definitely stay here again.EXCELLENT front desk service.  Very nice room.  Nice hotel.  Nice, friendly bar.  Mislead on the location by hotwire.  Shuttle OVERPRICED...and doesn't run late enough. They don't tell you a taxi downtown..where we THOUGHT we were staying...is less than the shuttle if you are more than one person.Would not stay again...only because of the LOCATION.Nice feature of this hotel is the shuttle to downtown Charleston. Runs every 1/2 hour. We came here for a short vacation which happened to New Years Eve. We took the shuttle downtown on New Years Eve and caught it back to the hotel after dinner. The rooms are nice and clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is vey safe. The lobby and common areas were nicely decorated. On the downside housekeeping didn't leave us fresh glasses (we left a good tip). They should really offer a self serve coffee service in the morning. The line at the cafe was long as they only had one person covering the bar and To-Go counter. If you are planning to spend a lot of time downtown Charleston you may want to go to the  Marriott Courtyard which is located right on Marion Square which is in the middle of downtown with many shopping and dining options within walking distance. The only other downside was that we could not change the input on the TV in the room and the TV was pretty small. I find the input issue strange because we stayed at the Marriott in Myrtle beach on the same trip and one of the features they touted was the entertainment system where you could customize the inputs etc. Overall we had a nice stay. Next time we would probably try the Courtyard just based on location.Friendly staff! I got a great deal. This hotel looks very elegant and my room is comfortable and clean. The historical district is probably less than five minutes of driving distance. The only thing that stinks is the wireless fee. I used my phone as a hotspot and it's obvious a few other rooms around me did the same. Otherwise, I think this hotel was fantastic.Just stopped in for a cold beer on a big night quest.  Nice bar.Stayed at the Charleston Marriott for a week on business. The hotel was nicer than the JW I stayed at in New Orleans. It's a clean, averaged priced hotel in a safe area with incredible staff and it features a good restaurant, a good bar and some incredible meeting and event space. The rates were average for the star/location, the room was clean and of average size and the staff was incredibly friendly. The bar was very reasonably priced, especially for a hotel bar, at $10 for a double Jack and $12 for a double Johnnie Walker (black). Surprisingly, they offered Blue label for $24 but I stayed with my usual drinks. The coffee was better than the Starbucks by my office, Their rib-eye was excellent, the braised pork chop was also really good. The waitstaff were very attentive. Their convention and meeting space was incredible (on par with nice hotels in Vegas just on a smaller scale). The Internet was a little hit or miss. The hotel said they are in the process of upgrading their system so that might explain things. Anyway, I would definitely stay here again...next time, I'm upgrading to one of the rooms with the little balcony's.This is a 2 star hotel W's star price. My experience has been awful. I checked in last night at 2:00 am after a long drive. The parking lot had no spaces. There is no valet!!  I was directed to an overflow lot next door. Ugh. I was traveling solo and didn't relish the thought of grappling with my luggage for a long walk.  This lack of service for a $215 a night hotel is absolutely unacceptable.  I requested security and got an unarmed ununiformed female who would have been no help had I encountered a problem. When I complained about the lack of parking I was told they  were having some parties along with a few Other weak excuses. I would   think the part goers would have been required to use  the overflow parking, not the"" paying dearly for very little guests"".  I called  for room service to deliver coffee the next morning. An hour later it still  had not arrived. I called again. It took another 25 minutes, and even then  my simple order was not right.  The decor is fine. The pillows are terrible.  The mattress could be a lot better. The view of the river is nice.  No  bathtub, no bathrobe.   There is nothing to make this hotel worth the  price. It is rated $$. The Renaissance where I stayed last week was $$$.  I paid about the same or a little less there, and had a better location,  experience, service, and a nicer hotel. Don't get sucked in here. I stayed  here because I couldn't find  a room elsewhere.  I would have been better off in a $60 room on the interstate. I was told this am that they are building a parking garage. And, to be fair, they comped my rm. Service coffee that I waited 90 minutes for. Still, I wouldn't stay here again.This place was top notch all around.  I have never stayed in a hotel that every person on the staff was so friendly and always said hi, how are you, have a good day, etc.  Seriously - every single person in the halls, outside, everywhere were sooo nice.  And it did not seem creepy or phony, just nice people. The lobby and entry area were really, really classy and nice.  And the pool was phenomenal, with beautiful tiles, and music going.  Nice view of the river from many rooms, if you took a walk, or from the roof bar. The room was clean, nice and as expected for a Marriott and I do not have one word to say negative about the whole stay.  We ate lunch in the restaurant which was very nicely decorated, and the food was great too.  Reasonable prices too.  The one downside is the overflow parking lot could be repaved.  But it is 100 feet from the front door so not that difficult of a situation really. One downside is you can not really walk ( 2+miles) to the historic district.......but cabs were there in less than 10 minutes when we called and $6.  So save your money and stay here......and get a great pool!TIP:  I used priceline in the Ashley River Area selection - and we won the room at an $85 bid for a 3 and a 1/2 star.  So try this and use the savings for more great food at dinners....!Thought I'd add my views here to balance things out some in case the negative review was just one persons bad day.",,,"['thanks',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/town-and-country-inn-and-suites-charleston,Town & Country Inn and Suites,4.5,$$,31,"Nice hotel and staff. For a year end stay everyone was very cheerful and attentive. The place is very clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast was great as well as the accommodations. Although it's located next to 17, it's very quiet and private. Highly recommended.I had reservations here to stay for a Bachelorette weekend,  and the hotel was very cute and a little fancy,  but what you would also see typically in a hotel. The associates we very generous and greeted us very nicely. The front of the hotel looks very small, yet it expands to the back a bit farther than you would think, so it's very spacious. Shared a room that holds 2 queen beds and a bathroom with a tub and Walk in shower. The hotel has entrance and exit access from the sides of the hotel for convenience.  They also have a in-ground pool which is centered in the middle of the hotel,  but located outside like a courtyard. They have a restaurant inside the hotel caked Trotters, they have a All-you-can-eat breakfast for $12.99. Had a great experience here, just wished I could of stayed in Charleston, South Carolina a bit longer, the weekend went by too fast. Until next time!!!One of the best hotels I've stayed at during all of my travels! Convenient to the airport and to the historic district, as well as to other sights, it is also close to many restaurants (three good BBQ places are nearby!) and stores (there is a grocery store right next door!), the room was large, clean and very comfortable, the staff were all friendly and accommodating.The rooms have recently been renovated; ours was spacious, immaculately clean, the bed and linens were incredibly comfortable. The bathroom and particularly shower were largest I've ever seen in a hotel.Although the hotel is strictly non-smoking, we had an issue of cigarette smoke wafting into our room the first night. It seems to have come from outside, or maybe a staff break room? Either way, the front desk person was very apologetic, gave us an extra restaurant voucher and luckily the issue did not re-appear.If you make a reservation through the hotel's website, you'll receive one $15 voucher per night's stay (not per person), which can only be used during a specified time frame (i.e. 3 nights, 3 vouchers, each of which can ONLY be used for dinner/drinks one night or breakfast the next morning). The Sunday breakfast buffet is a great deal at $13, and the weekday breakfast buffets are pretty good deals at $11 a person, although one can also order off the menu, as well.We had an excellent weekend stay here! The staff is very friendly and helpful! The hotel is welcoming and nicely done. The rooms are clean and very homey! We had a junior king suite with an air bath tub. It was so relaxing!  We did enjoy breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel but if you enjoy room service they provide that option and the prices are very resonable! I am so glad we chose this as our place to stay!Will recommend to anyone and everyone headed to Charleston. The rooms are clean, beautiful and luxurious, leaving nothing to be desired for the price range. We were delighted to find a minifridge, microwave and Keurig, a spacious shower stall and separate bath, as well as a NICE hair dryer similar to what I have at home. They are also generous with the toiletry items.The beds were very comfortable. My boyfriend and I take our memory foam pillows on every trip, but could have fallen asleep here without them. :)))Housekeeping was cheerful and friendly to our kids. The fitness center is small but well equipped with the basics in new &amp; immaculate condition. Beautiful pool area and courtyard, too! We will definitely be back!!!Hold the phone, I just went to a CVB event that was hosted at this hotel. We got a tour of the rooms and whoah this place is amazing! I'm definitely going to recommend to people looking to visit and stay near me in West Ashley. The event catering was delish; spanakopita, pimento cheese sandwiches, prime rib, goat cheese stuffed cherry tomatoes and in small but generous appetizer portions. Yum!!!!What a posh place in west Ashley!Wonderful hotel! We Picked it because of the price and the pool but it was better than we hoped for. Pretty close drive to Folly beach. Near a lot of great restaurants. We had BBQ dinner 5 min away and it was amazing. Great staff, very friendly attitude. You can drive around hotel and park closer to your room.This place is amazing. Amazing service, amazing rooms, just plain awesome. When we arrived back from our cruise early (like 7 a.m. early), they allowed us to check in to our room at 8 a.m., even though check-in wasn't until 3 p.m. They also gave us a $15 breakfast voucher at their delicious in-house restaurant. The rooms are very, very clean. It comes complete with a fitness center and pool and is within walking distance of a few restaurants and a grocery store.This is an overdue review for my visit to Charleston this past June. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Staff was kind, accommodating, helpful, and professional. The amenities are luxurious and clean. This hotel is affordable, beautiful, and very close to Charleston and Folly Beach. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and can't wait to return!My wife and I stayed here this week and the service here is outstanding. From check in ( Tracy and Pavi ) to the bar and dinning staff they made us feel at home. Breakfast and dinner were also above average. Look forward to coming back to these comfortable and clean rooms.Took our first trip to Charleston and since we are frequent travelers, I can say this is probably where we will stay when we come back... I'm like the other people (stayed there the same weekend as Natalie B's review) - I'm recommending this place to anyone &amp; everyone that comes to Charleston. I'm also writing this review as a retired flight attendant, so I've spent a very good portion of my life in hotels. After traveling across the country (literally West Coast to East Coast) just 4 wks ago and staying in some shocking substandard hotels, I was SO HAPPY to pull up to Town &amp; Country and see how cute &amp; maintained it is. VERY accessible from the Hwy too for out of town travelers, and if you just keep going down Savannah Hwy, you'll end up right downtown Charleston/by the Aquarium etc in less than 6 miles - it's a straight shot, so that was nice too. Plus Folly Beach is easily accessible from here as well.  From the beginning of our stay I was impressed, the desk staff was FANTASTIC, truly some of the best I've encountered checking in (&amp; as I said, I've stayed THOUSANDS of nights in hotels across the country), even more impressive than more 'swankier' hotels. Truly. Parking near our room was surprisingly a breeze &amp; when we stepped into the room we were actually shocked at how really nice it was. The rooms are very spacious, the furniture layout was so comfortable, there was a fridge/microwave &amp; Keurig &amp; the bathroom as FANTASTIC with a great shower &amp; separate bath. I even loved the ""my earth"" soap they had and usually I'm all about my own Aveda products that I bring lol. We got there &amp; we were tired, so we went with room service, food was great &amp; reasonably priced &amp; again, the service itself was FANTASTIC. The gentleman who delivered it was a doll and we saw him several more times thru our stay. Housekeeping did a GREAT job, they even went out of their way to ""de-shed"" my bed the next morning (I have crazy thick long hair that just loves to shed everywhere in the summer - whomever cleaned our room/made up the bed, literally cleared the bed of the mess of hair I shed lol - whomever she was, she's my hero!!).  So in summary, the staff is FANTASTIC all around, the facilities were BEAUTIFUL &amp; the location is really great for non-locals. We'll definitely be back! Thank you Town &amp; Country!If you don't want to pay the big bucks for staying in the historic district, this property is an excellent alternative.  Since it was recently renovated this place is like a shiny penny amongst dull tarnished coins.  The public areas are super clean and attractive.  The choice of colors and wood stains help to elevate the decor.Had we stayed more than one night we may have looked into booking a suite.  But being in town for such a short stay, their standard King was very comfortable.  The bed was definitely slumber inducing, and the room surprisingly quiet considering the hotel was almost full.  It was a blissful night sleep.We loved the separate tub and shower, and the fixtures and counter gleamed.  It was nice to have a small microwave, fridge and a Keurig in the room.  Ice was just down the hall.  In the courtyard area there was a small but attractive pool area and looked like a decent place to chill out after a day of sight seeing.The $15 voucher we received upon check-in was used toward the $10.99/per person, weekend breakfast buffet.  It was a very nice spread, not like the ones found at competing properties.  You really had to be careful as there was so much to choose from....praline french toast, thick bacon, grits, sausage, pancakes, sausage gravy &amp; biscuits, hash browns, oatmeal, muffins, fresh fruit, granola, cereal, yogurt, scrambled eggs,  etc.  The made to order station (only available on weekends) offered omelets and crepes.  Both had a nice selection of toppings and fillings, and both were skillfully prepared and very much enjoyed.  Nice having some jalapenos in your eggs to kick start the day.All in all a big thumbs up.This is a nice hotel for this price range.  Very clean and updated, with a Keurig, microwave, and fridge in the room.  The hotel is made up of several smaller buildings, so don't expect to go to the check in desk with all your stuff and head straight to your room.  I had no problem driving around toward the back of the hotel to park near the building where my room was located, there was plenty of parking available near each of the buildings.  Staff was very nice and professional.Lovely place to stay, rooms were fully equipped and very comfortable, terrific outdoor pool tucked away within an interior courtyard, super friendly staff and fantastic breakfast. Direct book to get a $15 voucher. Great price too! Highly recommend.Very often I have encountered less than impressive hotel accommodations, but the Town &amp; Country far exceeded my expectations! I arrived for a fast-paced wedding weekend and was promptly greeted by a kind and cheerful staff member at the front desk. My room was clean, spacious and fully stocked with things I usually forget to pack (toiletries, mostly). The king bed was a comfortable, welcome sight! The housekeeping staff made a point to say 'hello' in the hallways, and on the day I checked out the front desk graciously held my bags for four hours while I explored downtown Charleston. The breakfast buffet had a large variety of options as well. I will certainly stay here again.Like this place... less in price than some of the downtown places, but MORE bang for the buck.  Nicer rooms, bathrooms, amenities, etc.  Rates are very good and Dtown is only  a few miles away.  Plus guaranteed parking too.  We WILL be back.Visited Charleston for spring break and stayed at town and country. We chose them because of the good reviews and was not disappointed.  This hotel looks very nice. We asked for a double queen.  The room was roomy and one of the nicest we have stayed in.  All the staff were extremely polite and helpful. At first we thought the location was not going to be convenient but it was just fine.  About 5 miles from downtown. No trouble at all. As we visited  downtown we realized parking was a challenge. So we were glad we did not stay in the city. The breakfast buffet is like fine dining. None of that cold  continental stuff other chain hotels offer. Everything was hot and southern. Reserve directly to get the daily $15 voucher which makes the breakfast free.I have stayed here twice in the past year when in Charleston for business and was impressed both times with the quality of the hotel.  The hotel is a lot cheaper than the hotels in historic Charleston and only a 10 minute drive to MUSC.  If you book through the hotel website, you can get a voucher for breakfast or lunch at the hotel.  Breakfast is a buffet and the voucher covers it for one person - the buffet includes yummy fresh made pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs, grits, potatoes, oatmeal, cereals, yogurt, juice, coffee, etc.  Both rooms are stayed in were incredibly nice and comfortable.  They have microwaves, refrigerators, and Keurig machines.  There's a Bi-Lo practically in walking distance.  The bathrooms in the hotel rooms are also very nice with a separate shower and tub and lots of space.  The first time I stayed back in the summer of 2013 they did not have a full length mirror in the hotel rooms but on this last trip they did - I think that was the only con on the first trip.The front desk was friendly and helpful.  When I decided to end my work trip early due to winter weather issues, they were totally fine with me making the change the morning I was to check out.  I really appreciated this.We just stayed here for 3 nights because our friends who were getting married in West Ashley recommended it. Typically we stay in the downtown, historic area, but we decided to try something different this time.We liked this hotel a lot; clean rooms and common areas, friendly staff and convenient location. There is a grocery store within walking distance and a mall and lots of restaurant options  (including Graucho's)  very close. For what you get, it is reasonably priced. However, it is obviously not the same experience as staying downtown; not too far away though.4.5 stars. Great room--comfortable beds, very clean, nice amenities. We enjoyed staying 10 or so minutes away from downtown, historic Charleston (better priced) and it wasn't a bad drive both days of our two day trip. We came in on a Sunday around 2pm and the parking lot was packed (Sunday brunch buffet) but it cleared out not too long after. The only downside was the indoor gym. The setup was really weird and it was difficult to impossible to watch the TV while running on the treadmill. I'd definitely suggest the hotel rethink the gym setup, but that's a minor detail. There are some good restaurants nearby too that don't require you to go all the way into downtown. I'd definitely stay here if I go to Charleston again.","Granted it is not  in a scenic area of Charleston but  this hotel was fantastic AND a great bargain too. Charleston is an expensive place and that makes this hotel an even better bargain. I second all the positive reviews of the facilities. Really pretty place with nice sized rooms. Can't comment on the food since we didn't eat here. The staff was gracious too.Very clean and pretty. Definitely a place you want to take someone you are trying to impress. Also great if you just like nice hotels. We got the Standard 2 Queen Bed room. The size of the room is good enough for a family of 3 or 4. There is a mini fridge and a microwave as well as a Keurig. There is a small closet and a safe. The bathroom is awesome. Bathtub could fit two skinny people. Separate walk in shower. Beds dont look queen size they look full size.That made me sad and is my only complaint.This is a lovely hotel and when the renovation project is complete, it will be a real stunner!  Located just off the south end of I-528 and about 10 minutes from downtown Charleston, this place is a hidden jewel!  And a a real bargain.Our room was gorgeous, well-organized (a corner wet bar contains all the appliances: a Keurig coffee maker, microwave, and refrigerator), the closet has a sliding door and laptop safe.  The linens are lovely and the beds - dreamy!  A spacious walk-in shower separate from the bathtub compliments the bathroom. There is virtually no traffic noise because the guest rooms are located behind the lobby, restaurant, and conference rooms. There is plenty of convenient parking and the property seems very secure.  Don't pass up the Sunday breakfast buffet.   It' is not included in the price of the room,  but worth the experience! Finally, kudos to the hotel staff.  They are friendly, helpful, and were incredibly responsive.  Can't wait to stay here again!I can only talk about our room because we stopped there just for the night and left right away the next day, but I wished I had more days there. We were in Charleston for the long memorial weekend, mini road trip and just had one day in the area. We had no reservation and when we started looking for a hotel room everything was packed. There were tons of people there that weekend and I don't even know at how many hotels we stopped. This was recommended from another hotel that was full and the lady said they still had a couple of rooms. We drove there as fast as we could and they only had 2 Jr. suites.Not much of an option, and it wasn't really expensive, we needed a bed, so we took it.This room was beautiful, big and clean and spacious and fabulous and everything looked new. And there was marble and a beautiful glass shower, and a jet tub in between the bathroom and the bed. And the bed was huge and comfy and the comforter was about 10,000 lbs heavy so you went to sleep and it would not let you get up haha!!!All in all, it was a fantastic room!!!This hotel looks nice &amp; all, but it's just been remodeled. It'll starting wearing down quick. First off, I called to ask if they provided portable cribs (pack'n'play) and the receptionist seemed to have no clue what I was talking about.( FYI every hotel we've stayed in, even low-end, has them nowadays). When we got there to check in i asked again &amp; different lady, but same response. Said she'd look into it, but never heard back. Signs all over saying we are a""green"" hotel and to put towels you want replaced on floor or in tub. We did neither &amp; they replaced all just as any place would. Lastly, the breakfast Buffett, YUCK. We had it on weekday &amp; weekend(more stuff on weekend) and where to begin. Menu says fresh fruit, ummm more like fresh out of a can. The weekend buffet had ""fresh"" not very good grapes, melon &amp; grapefruit along with the canned crap &amp; it was not much better. As well as cottage cheese &amp; stewed prunes so you can guess who the target crowd is. If you're looking for anything ""light"" good luck. Bread, potatoes, &amp; meat is all you'll find here. No cold cereal, no yogurt. Asked for hot tea &amp; I get lipton's which is prob what they use to make their iced tea. Can't believe people come for the buffet that aren't staying at the hotel &amp; lots of them. Oh yeah &amp; both mornings the host was busy texting as we walked in. We were given restaurant vouchers for every day we were there since hotel was still under construction. We didn't even use them all. Can't speak for any other meals, all we had was breakfast. Bottom line, new clean reasonably priced place to stay if you don't mind being 5-10 drive from downtown charleston, but skip the breakfast buffet!!!!!This hotel is beautiful.  I would highly recommend it.  It is immaculate inside &amp; out.  Their restaurant serves up a wonderful hot breakfast including made to order omlets, pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausage, hash browns, French toast, fresh fruit, fresh creamy yogurt  &amp; I could go on &amp; on.  On top of that, the restaurant couldn't be more lovely.  Book directly through the hotel to get breakfast vouchers.  All employees that we came in contact throughout our stay were warm &amp; helpful &amp; even go out of their way for you.  They also have a lovely pool.   We would definitely stay here again.  Classy place for the reasonable rates!My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week last August and we are planning on returning! It was a fantastic deal and the hotel was very modern, comfortable and clean. It was about 7-8 minutes drive from downtown Charleston, but it was perfect for us, since we liked the slower atmosphere. There were many places to eat and shop within walking distance. I had a problem with my debit card when we first arrived, but the staff was very sweet and worked with me.Was in area for a wedding recently, hotel was clean, friendly staff and good value. If in area and don't want expensive downtown location I would recommend.Just finished a four day stay and loved it. Jr. Suit was large and comfortable with a great bed. Hotel was still under construction but it didn't effect anything. Staff was helpful and nice. The location is easy to get to and very convenient to both downtown and Kiawah island.Just stayed at this hotel. The remodel is beautiful! The price is very reasonable for everything you get. The pictures are accurate in depicting what the remodeled rooms like. It's 10/15 minutes from downtown Charleston where we spent most of our time. You won't be disappointed!Cute place, good location near to Charleston but a fraction of the price. Rooms are clean, updated with spacious bathrooms (we had a king room) comfy bed/ linens, loved the Keurig. Renovations going on but you only notice it out front. One thing they needed was a full length mirror in the room...a must have folks!! Oh and we were under the impression we would get a $15 voucher for their breakfast buffet but we only got a $5...although we ended up finding the best diner down the road so it worked

http://www.yelp.com/biz/comfort-inn-downtown-charleston-charleston,Comfort Inn Downtown Charleston,3.0,$$,32,"NOT DOWNTOWNAbout 1.5 miles to downtownRooms are clean and spacious, beds are comfy, breakfast is decent, check in was fine.All in all, average, but if you are looking to be close to town at a lower rate than being right downtown, this is your place.Hotel was easy to locate and has free parking! Such an added bonus. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Our room was great! Clean cool and comfortable. Great place to stay in charelston.Not my favorite hotel. Everything was clean, the staff was friendly, and the free breakfast was decent, but the website advertises it as being close to downtown and it really isn't. We have a nice view of parking lots and a Burger King from our tiny window. Since I am in Charleston, I would like to be able to sit outside, but there isn't really any outdoor seating other than by the tiny dirty pool, which is closed at this time of year. And the internet is agonizingly slow.I would say that if you are visiting the VA hospital across the street, or maybe the med school, this would be a prime location, and it really is fairly decent, but if you come expecting a vacation destination like I did, you will be sorely disappointed. Two stars for false advertisingThis is the second time we stayed here.  The first time was better service but the parking was horrendous.  This time the parking was better even though our car got scrapped.  You get what you pay for as my dad would always say!  The elevators are fast and the ice machine worked.  The free breakfast was okay, always packed with people.  My main gripe this time; we never had towels when we wanted them.  Everyday we had to wait on towels.  So bring your own if you plan on staying here.  Now, we were after Christmas, the place was busy, but again, it was hard to get towels when you wanted them!  The staff was nice and courteous.  The mattress was comfortable for the king size bed.  We stayed in room 301 and there way always noise and banging coming from the stairwell.  Don't know if I would stay here again.It's a typical vintage chain property. Not upscale but not a poke-and-go either. Generally clean and everything works ok. We had a great flat panel TV with easy access to accessory ports. If you're coming for vacation and want to visit historic district or the beach then their only advantage is price. It's not really walking distance to anything and in/out parking is a major pita. Except! And it's a huge exception, if you're here for the hospitals then it's super convenient. VAMC is across the street and MUSC is about a block. That's really the ideal guest here - those who need to be close to the hospitals. There's some fast food nearby and plenty of delivery options but no real super eats in walking distance. Bottom line: for vacation you might rather be elsewhere. For hospital visits it's excellent.Maybe two stars is a bit harsh, but as I think back on my stay, it's the bad things that stand out.  I was in for three nights for business, and was moderately satisfied with my stay.  PROS:-free wireless internet-free breakfast with food that people might actually want to eat-The room and furniture/tv were nice and modern.-The staff were friendly and helpful.CONS:-One night my room randomly started smelling like a bathroom that someone just took a dump in.  It went away just as randomly about 2 hours later.-My room was directly across the hall from the housekeeping hub where they keep all the supplies.  This meant that there was a lot of housekeeping staff talking very loudly right outside my door, starting at like 7AM.  I would have been pissed if I was there on vacation, but because I was working, I was up anyway.-The breakfast area had a very bad fruit fly infestation.  We had to throw out food a couple times because one had drowned in the food/drink.I think a 3.5 is probably a more accurate rating but Yelp doesn't allow half stars, yet. I only stayed one night at the Comfort Inn. I should start our with the positives. The rooms were very clean and comfortable.  The air conditioner kept the room cool and the TV had full cable. The decor was modern, fresh, and appealing. They had a nice continental breakfast available in the morning. Now the not-so-good. I felt the location sucked. Yes there's a free trolley outside but it only runs every 30 minutes and can be difficult to navigate. The receptionist told me to take one trolley to the Visitor's Center, then switch to another trolley to get to where I was going. It sounded like a pain and time consuming so we just drove. This hotel is a good 1.5-2 miles from Historic Charleston. This hotel is very large and there's only two, very slow elevators. There's stairs available but only with outside entrances and exits. It's odd. Also, as others have said - the staff isn't exactly friendly or accommodating. They weren't rude but I felt they provided bare minimum service. All in all - for one night it was more than fine. However, if you're planning a visit to Charleston as a vacation then I would look elsewhere.Price was high for what we got. Paid 128 a night as part of a wedding block deal. Room was ok. Iron burns in the carpet. Shower didn't drain. Breakfast was alright (generic continental hot and cold breakfast) stayed in the bridal suite for a nights. Very large with a nice balcony. There was a late dead cockroach in the bridal suite. Pool was pretty lame and parking was very limited. Not that close to bars and restaurants. One elevator was broken the whole stay (4days) which was a pain and the stairs did not connect to the lobby.The hotel is a mix of 3, 4, and a 5.Location to the Historic Downtown Charleston - there is a free trolley (18 min? ride) that takes you into the Historic Downtown - Charleston Visitor Center. From there another free trolley takes you onto King Street (green line), Aquarium (orange line), and City Market (green line). Just take the purple line back to the hotel.Parking situation - we left our car at the hotel the whole time. We just took the shuttle and a cab at night $8 flat via 7-star luxury taxi. My husband and I thought I was a good deal and never had to worry about parking in the downtown area. The best thing was we kept our good parking spot. Extra Parking - was told you can park in the bank area, especially on the weekends since they are closed on sat/sun.Free Continental Breakfast - was alright. You can get full off the biscuit, toast, cereal, egg, sausage patties, yogurt, waffles, banana.. Sounds like a lot. Foodie spots - there were not a lot of foodie spots around the inn. You are pretty much next to the hospitals, VA center, medical university center of it all. Con - if you want to go to the beach (ie Folly Beach) yes, you would have to take your car. Hotel itself - it looked like the hotel had renovated and looked more up to date. Yet.. One thing that irked me was no security box to store your valuables. Thankfully we didn't bring anything valuable. The room was spacious, somewhat modern contemporary. It's not shabby and a lot better than what I have expected.Service - I would have to say the lack of towels that they replenished. We came back to the hotel room to find only 2 bath towels, and no hand towels and only 1 face towel.A real bummer of a hotel. The door to the room I was originally assigned was propped open and smelled like some type of mold/chemical/pesticide, pretty terrible. After a 30 minute wait, I was changed to another room. I know hotel staff are busy and all, but it's a disappointing introduction to Charleston, SC. I don't recommend staying here - not worth the price or location - there are better hotels in the area to check out.Update - there were also bugs in my room, including cockroaches.Run down, tired building. VERY little parking, room was dirty, nail trimmings between beds and nightstand. This is a cash cow due to being adjacent the VA and MU SC hospitals. Obviously corporate is squeezing all they can out out this facility. It is an insult to a staff that tries very hard to provide excellent service. Shame on them!  Read the canned responses from management with the low ratings on the Choice website. It is obvious volume trumps running a decent facility. This was our 5th trip to Charleston and have used the nearby Holiday Inns previously and they are infinitely better. Stay with them. The round HI is older but much cleaner with PLENTY of free parking. DO NOT help their bottom line. Maybe they will get the message.This is a descent, affordable hotel in an otherwise very expensive city for travelers.  I was able to stay two weekend nights for less than half what other hotels were charging in downtown.  Granted, this hotel is a long walk into downtown, but there is a free trolley that picks up in front of the hotel.  I tried that once but it took quite awhile and still puts you off north by the visitor's center (yet another 15 minute walk into the middle of the tourist area.)  We found that driving and paying to park was still much more affordable than paying to stay downtown - a cab ride back at night cost us $12.On to the hotel itself.  I wasn't overly enthused with the cleanliness of the hotel when I arrived.  The pillows looked dingy and the sheets were super wrinkled.  I also immediately tossed one pillow for the duration of my stay as there were two different, long hairs on it.  Aside from that the room was pretty clean.  There bathroom wasn't shining, that's for sure, and the toiletries were all half used.  Definitely a poor housekeeping crew.  Then the traditional issue with a chain hotel - the air condition.  I set it as low as it would go and consistently woke up in the middle of the night sweating.  It never got cool in our room and it was April - I hate to stay in this room in August!The room itself was updated very nicely with a modern color scheme and furniture, which made up for the drab experience otherwise.  There's free parking, coffee in the lobby, a business center, friendly staff, and again, the trolley outside.  So for the price, it will suffice.Staying in Charleston isn't cheap!  Well getting within spitting distance of either a beach or downtown isn't cheap at least.  And even the hotels in the North Charleston area that are from the nicer brands are pretty pricey.  So when I saw that I could get the Comfort Inn on Bee Street for less then $80 a night I decided to roll the dice and see what I could get.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm no stranger to Motel 6, Super  8, and the like but I have come to appreciate the nicer things in life and I do prefer a better brand if I'm going to be staying somewhere for more then a single night.Comfort Inn on Bee street was a solid 3 star experience for me.  No it wasn't as nice as say a Hilton Garden Inn or a Hyatt Place but it wasn't bad either.  I would rate it a solid value and a good alternative to somebody staying in Charleston on a budget.  Let me list for you the highlights, middlelights and lowlights of my experience.First the Hotel was renovated within the last 5 years.   In this case that means a flat screen TV, a working fridge (cleverly hidden in the cabinet that held the TV), unstained carpet, unworn furniture,  and a decent neutral color palate.  In another 5 years I might have a different opinion but for now the decor and upkeep are just fine.  The hotel offered hot free breakfast every morning that included at minimum, scrambled eggs, waffles, biscuits and gravy and various continental offerings.  The waffles were excellent, and they helped me fuel up each morning for a busy day, while saving me dollars.  Housekeeping was friendly and attentive.  Tipping didn't hurt, but it was nice to get fresh towels each day, especially since my  GF and I use a lot of them.  The bed was comfortable, and the AC was strong.  The pool was clean and of decent size, and the ice machines and drink machines all worked.  The room was quiet, there was neither guest noise, nor traffic noise to disturb our sleep.  Fellow guest were very quiet and unobtrusive (we had the pool all to ourselves the afternoon we decided to use it).  A lot of them were apparently staying there for use of the VA hospital that was across the street.  The staff was mostly friendly and helpful.  Even the least friendly of them weren't  rude, just not quite as overtly cheerful.Some of the issues that were middling for me included parking that was inadequate.  I was here midweek so I always found a space, but I bet parking here on a weekend is a royal pain in the you know what.   The lot is simply not big enough for the size of the hotel, and they have closed off the dirt lot under the freeway over pass that used to handle over flow.  The address IS a downtown address, but it is not within walking distance of any of the things you want to see.  You will have to use the FREE Dash trolly to get to the tourist areas of town.  But in my case that was going to be true for me no matter which hotel I ended up picking.  Hotels in the heart of downtown are significantly more expensive then this place.  Once the hotel had a beautiful view of the Ashley river.   Then some developer plopped a high rise apartment right next to it and better then half the rooms that had great views no longer do.  I was fortunate to get a room that still had a piece of river view.  The bathroom was of adequate size but the lighting was not too hot for a couple of girls trying to put on makeup.  In addition the counter top was tiny and completely inadequate for even one girl to use let alone two.  The TV was nice but the cable selection was limited.Things I really disliked here included pillows that were completely inadequate in size and quantity.  I've seen toss pillows that were bigger and fluffier then these.  Towels were likewise entirely too small.  I couldn't even wrap one around my body after getting out of the shower and I am pretty slim.  Two out of three mornings breakfast had no meat choice.  The first morning we had sausage but the next two mornings there was nothing but scrambled eggs.  That's kinda weak even for free if you ask me.  There were no towels provided at the pool, and no extras that I could use from my room.  There were literally two full sized towels available for two guest each day, and it's not like I want to use a bath towel to wipe off chlorinated water.  The dryer tried to eat my hair.  I've never had this happen before, but some of my hair got sucked in to the back side of the tiny dryer (thankfully not a lot of it).  There really should be some kind of guard on it to prevent that kind of thing from happening.In the end Comfort Inn provided just what I needed for my trip to Charleston, a clean, economical place to rest my head and wash my hair that was convenient to downtown, and the Cooper River bridge.  While it didn't wow me, it got the job done, and it didn't detract from my vacation.  I would stay here again, and I would recommend it to others on a budget.  It was a good value for the dollar and I enjoyed my stay.We had a good stay at a reasonable rate . Clean contemporary room . Complimentary breakfast was above average with eggs , sausage and waffles along with all the other usuals. Served early though 6-9.  So don't sleep in too late . Lol  . Trolly stop is right next to the  hotel for a free and easy ride into town . Friendly staff . RecommendedI picked this because the price was decent and it was near everything in Charleston.Our room looked like it was almost brand new.  The rfid touch cards to enter the room were really cool.They had all the basics, hot water, clean everything, cold AD.The downsides- the parking is a mess.Convenient location. Fairly good breakfast considering it's free. Staff was all friendly. Good price. Next comparable price we found was 20 miles out of the city. And that was only $10 less. Plus the parking is free and on site, and a free trolley takes you down town every 30 minutes.The best thing I can say about this place is that it is convenient to historic Charleston, friendly front desk staff and reasonably priced.   However, this chain has much more comfortable inns.  The night we stayed there the fire alarm went off at 1 a.m. and we all were evacuated outside in December.  As i stood there in my jammies with about 50 other guests, I heard the young man from behind the front desk offer an apology to the firemen when they got there.  Well,  I guess that can happen but from my experience the management appears lacking in many ways so here's my to do list for them:1.  Renew worn out and threadbare linens2.  Discard or donate stained blankets3.  Be sure rooms have washcloths4.  Maintain elevators.  (Both should ALWAYS be working for such a large facility) and4.  Hot water would be nice, too.The hotel staff are very nice and friendly. My father was at MUSC for surgery and had to stay an extra day, but we wouldn't find out until late in the evening. I tried several other hotels on the list I was given by the hospital staff and this was the only one who understood the stressful situation of being in a hospital with a loved one and not knowing exact plans. It was such a comfort to know that a bed was waiting for me and it is within walking distance from the hospital. I got an excellent nights sleep, the bed was super comfortable.This hotel is outside downtown Charleston, but closer to the airport and my new favorite, Hominy Grill.  It was a great place to stay for one night while we were en route to Asheville.  Rooms are clean and updated, and staff were friendly and helpful.  The only gripe is the parking, there is not much of it,  and the spillover parking is in a mudlot.  We didn't have the breakfast, so no thoughts on that.  Overall, a nice, quiet, stay.I enjoyed my stay! Hotel staff were really nice and hospitable. Continental breakfast includes biscuit, sausage, eggs, gravy, and so much more! Rooms were nice and clean. The area is right by the freeway so it is conveniently located right outside of town. The trolley is free and runs every 30 min to downtown.Conveniently located about a 10 minute walk from hominy grill.Overflow parking is at the bank parking lot next door on the weekends.","Stayed here for a night in April 2013. Room was nice and pretty modern. The bed was comfortable. I really had no complaints with this hotel. I had a few problems, my key cards didn't work and they gave me the wrong type of room, I wanted smoking, reserved and paid for smoking, was given non, but the hotel staff was very kind and always fixed whatever issue I had at the time. Parking wasn't that great but it was free so I can't really complain. Overall I would stay here again.This place was downright dirty. The room was damp &amp; smelled awful (there were no windows to air it out). Our toilet straight up wouldn't flush. And worse of all, we found about 3-4 bugs (spiders &amp; mini roaches) in our first room. They did switch our room after we complained.I realize for the location you can't beat the price, but Comfort Inn would have to pay me to stay in one of their Inns ever again. I suggest AIRBNB if you are trying to find a more affordable option downtown.staying here for a few nights. comfortable and the staff are very nice. nothing special but an adequate hotelI had a mixed experience here.  I came down for a wedding weekend, and when I went to check in at 4, our rooms were not ready.  So i asked when I could check in.  I had a rehearsal dinner that night, only an hour away.  I was told 20 minutes.  So I stood in the lobby and waited with all my stuff.  After about 30 minutes of sitting there, I watched person after person check in.  I then decided to walk back up to the desk and ask if I could now check in and if my room was ready.  The gentlemen that told me to wait, then said, why yes your room is ready.  As exciting as that sounds, I was kind of pissed, I had to walk back up.  If you visit this place, you will see why I made this comment.  Their seating is about 10 steps away from the front desk.  You couldn't tell me my room was ready any sooner.  That was really irritating.  On a light note, the stay was not bad.  We had no conversation with the staff the entire time we were there until check out.  The beds are nothing to brag about, as the springs can be felt, the rooms are a average size, however I guess thats what you get for the price in charleston.  Check out day was a breeze, I just walked out.  The one thing that bothered me was when I left something behind.  I called and asked if they could check the room.  They said they would and get back to me.  2 hours went bye, so I called back.  The guy at the front desk, said he would check with housekeeping, a second time and get back to me.  When I say a second time, Im referring to me asking, he didn't even remember having the convo with me about this.  So I waited another hour, and called back for a 3rd time.  Finally I said I will wait till you call them while I am on the phone.  I was irritated to say the least.  After a few moments, he came back on and said he found it, and would ship it right away.  The fee would be applied to my card.  I was fine with that.  Thinking postal service would be maybe 10 bucks for a small Ipad stand.  Boy was i wrong.  Postage and boxing was about $20.  The cost of my item.  On top of that there was a eronius $10 fee that was paid, almost like a tip.  It had no explanation.  I paid $30 to ship a small ipad stand that cost me $20.  Had I known they were going to spend this I would have said don't bother.  However, I still have no idea, where the $10 extra on that went.  Cash back to the guy at the hotel.  Yeah, I had to work hard for that.  I was less than thrilled with the customer service I received here, and I question if I will return.  Im not going to tell you not to go, but, read this and make your own opinion.Very low ceiling with gross popcorn ceiling. The room has some smell I cannot what it smell like but I didn't like it. The coverlet is patched here and there. I don't mind it but it seems some update. I don't think what I paid only gets me a very frugal place with patched bedding. The staff are friendly but they cannot help me on the wireless internet issue. However, wireless internet is free in all rooms without password. The location is good and bad, and it depends what you are here for. There is a free trolley takes you to downtown, and it comes every half hour. It takes you right to the visitor information center. However, it goes one direction only so the trip to downtown is much longer than coming back since it is a big loop. There is nothing worth taking a walk for. If you are here for fun, you have to drive or take the trolley. I didn't enjoy the stay since I like bright and clean room without scary popcorn ceiling. If you are totally fine with these, this place is much cheaper than B&amp;B and you don't have to drive to downtown if you will come back before 8:30 pm.Pros: Friendly staff, comfy beds, free wi-fi, decent showersCons: - The parking situation is really annoying. It's not located in an area where you can walk anywhere conveniently, which means you're required have a car at all times - and yet there aren't nearly enough parking spaces. So you have to park at the bank next door and be met with signs saying you'll be towed if you don't move your car by 7am. - Other details, like dysfunctional vending machines and super slow elevators, were also annoying. - I think it's way overpriced for the quality and location. I got a lower rate since I went at the tail end of a renovation,but the door says that my standard room was $199/night. I wouldn't pay more than $90/night if I went back. - The website says there's a pool and fitness room, but if these things do exist, they definitely weren't noticeable anywhere.A bit expensive for the location which is technically in town but not in a walkable way.  The room (junior suite) was really spacious and clean.  The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of pillows.  The furnishings were not so great.  One of the chairs was completely collapsed in the seat springs.  It looked fine, but then sitting in it was um, stabby and painful.  Hot water was ample and very hot in our room.  The breakfast was good and filling.  The pool was also clean and pretty big for a downtown hotel - it is rooftop on a middle level, but was easy to find.  Wifi was free which sadly isn't a given at hotels.  We didn't have any problem with the elevators being slow.  Parking is a problem if the hotel is full or nearly full.  The lot is not adequate for the number of guests and causes the bank parking issues mentioned in other reviews. Staff was surly as Audrey mentioned.  I stood at the front desk unacknowledged for minutes before the woman working the desk deigned to help me.  Apparently her nail care and personal phone call took precedence over guest services.What Kelly R. said + the hot water hasn't worked in like two days.  It's not bad enough to hate completely, but wow everything (with the possible exception of the breakfast) was in ill order.Don't let the staff call a cab for you.   The cabs in Charleston suck, but the guy the called for me... shudder.reasonably priced hotel in town. It's right opposite the medical center and presumably houses families of patients who are in the hospital. The place is only 2-3 minute drive from the center of Charleston. Very convenient. It's not quite walkable however. It has free wireless, and free breakfast in the morning.Generally clean and attentive. One thing to know is that the underground water system floods in hightide and the road around the hotel can have deep patches of water. It doesn't really affect the hotel though, just to know that these patches of water can obscure the road leading to the hotel.Good price and an ok place.  About 1 mile walk from historic area.The staff is surly and unhelpful. The location is acceptable if you do not mind driving to everything.Good location, clean, and affordable.",,,,"['miles', 'clean', 'spacious', 'beds', 'comfy', 'breakfast', 'decent', 'check', 'fine',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/market-pavilion-hotel-charleston,Market Pavilion Hotel,3.5,$$$$,63,"I've been to Charleston countless times and stayed everywhere in town and around town. I can't believe this is my first stop to Market Pavilion, but I never want to stay anywhere else. I feel so welcomed here. My room is immaculate, this is an important message. Hotels skeeve me out. The idea of stepping into a shower thousands of other feet stepped into, that's clearly not clean... Questionable bedding. I have never stayed in a more perfect room. The shower was hard to leave. Our view of The Market and Harbour was outstanding. The staff was kind. The Pavillion Bar, restaurant, pool, and oh yes the view complete with sunset of the skyline and harbor are amazing. The on site restaurant also wonderful. If we weren't in Charleston we wouldn't have left the hotel.Thanks for a wonderful anniversary. We look forward to staying again and again!This review is just for the rooftop bar.  The first time we came here, we intended to just have a drink and soak up the view and then head out for a nice dinner.  But as we were enjoying our drinks, servers kept going by us with good looking trays of food and my husband just couldn't help himself: he saw waffle fries, he ordered waffle fries.  And that night we had waffle fries for dinner.  The portion was huge (not complaining--we ate every last one!) and we were so full that we couldn't eat anything else.The bar area itself is beautiful, with a good number of tables and the view can't be beat.  If you can manage to be there around sunset, you will not be disappointed.View, food, drinks, service were beyond great! The view was so amazing but really the service was so much better than you would ever imagine. So sweet and southern!  I will be back! Ha ha ha!Wow!!! Let's talk about that view-AMAZING!! I was surprised to walk on the roof and see a pool, a bar, lounge chairs, and high top tables! It was breathtaking! We were able to snag the last table and the DJ was super sweet to bring us our menus. The three of us ordered drink while we looked at the menu in hopes of sharing an appetizer. My drink was perfect-fruit and refreshing. We ordered a flatbread pizza to share and we all were extremely pleased with our selection! Our server, Andrew did a pretty good job. It was nice that the manager stopped by our table asking where we were from. He offered suggestions on other places to go for food and fun!! People were very nice about taking photos for us. The restroom was very clean. As we left and walking through the hotel lobby to exit, the smell of delicious food was overwhelming! The roof top experience is amust for out of towners!!Just reviewing the rooftop bar.Hung out here before dinner at Grill 225. We were lucky enough to find seats at the bar as this place was packed. We ordered drinks and the lobster &amp; calamari ceviche from the menu. The ceviche was so good; it came with blue corn chips. There were nectarine pieces in there as well as lemon grass strips, yum!It is beautiful up here; the views of the water and Charleston were beautiful. We were also in time for the sunset! We will definitely be back here for drinks!Where do I begin? We arrived in Charleston for a short weekend getaway. It was our first time visiting so we were very excited. We arrived at the hotel and ""apparently"" JetBlue getaways didn't book one of our two rooms so we had to scramble to get a second room. Derek and I were given our keys to go up while my parents were dealing with getting the second room for them. After a 6 minute wait for the elevator (we later found out that one out of the two elevators were broken...read below for more on this and see photo) we were taken up to our room which was directly next to the elevator. We were okay with that although that wasn't too ideal, but then when we went to open our window to view our first views of Charleston, we discovered that our view was a brick wall less than a good away from the window. We went downstairs and my parents gave us their room and they were then ""upgraded"". Our second and final room was 75 degrees when we walked in and was being turned down for the night at 4pm. So we couldn't even relax in the room or sit on the bed because it was prepared for sleep. We went downstairs to talk about the air conditioning and my father also called downstairs on his own to see if there was anything that they could do, and off we went for a walk-in the hopes that by the time we got back, it would be fixed. We got back about two hours later to shower before eating at 225 grill and it was the same temperature as it was when we left! Taking a shower was useless because I immediately started sweating after it. I went down to the front desk and told them that I would rather sleep in the hallway and that's when they said they'd send someone up but they already checked and everything was fine. (They absolutely did not check because we later found out that the air wasn't working or on and they finally fixed it while we were eating.)The elevator ride that night after dinner was 15 minutes. The second elevator still wasn't working. Finally we said we were hotel guests and they threw us into the staff elevator. The rooftop bar is very popular and there are lines starting at 5pm. I even said to Derek that I was scared to leave the hotel room because then we'd have to wait for the elevator for who knows how long. Off we went on a walking tour the next morning. We were told by the hotel that it would be a max of 16 people but there were 24 people -We left after 45 minutes. The elevator still was not fixed and it was dreadful waiting for it to come down. That night we had a wonderful experience where we chartered a boat (I did this independently without the hotel) and when we got back we had a 20 minute elevator wait. Then that evening at around 3am there was a group of guys and gals drink and one girl was running back and forth on our floor crying and screaming-obviously drunk. Not the best way to end our last night in Charleston. Steak is good. Go there for dinner, but if you want a carefree trip, don't stay at this hotel.NAY: probably not best to stay here on a romantic getaway.Ahhhhhh....what a place . Rooftop bar and Tuna tower to die for more than enough for two people unless one is your wife, she said order your own!Great view of the city and harbor, special place to catch your breath on top floor of Market PavilionThis review is for the rooftop bar.Outstanding views and DJ'd music.  Good amount of tables lined around the perimeter of the roof top to allow for optimized viewing.The drinks were good, albeit some were over priced (Raspberry Mojito  $16?)The Food was, by far,  the biggest disappointment.  Duck nachos, Beef quesadillas, and shrimp cocktail , all had unusually bad taste and were priced above the marketplace pricing. This is something that can be fixed considering all the great food management talent in the marketplace.We met a friend at the hotel bar, the drinks were expensive but I wasn't surprised given the luxurious feel of the hotel, I was shocked that they charged me $3 for club soda after I had already paid for two cocktails.  We ended the night at the rooftop bar, you have to stalk a table to get one but they are all on the permieter so they all have an amazing view of the city so it's worth it to hover; we even did our good deed and let another couple share out table.I travel often and the overnight staff for 10/28/15 were extremely unprofessional. On numerous occasions we asked for normal accommodations and expected basic courtesy and yet were treated in a bizarre fashion. I want to give the benefit of the doubt here, but the gentleman we dealt with was unable or unwilling to give a tone of understanding to people like us that don't live here and simply had the most basic of expectations. Move on along from this place, or at the lest expect to have a hit or mis experience. But definitely stay away from the kitchen, would be our best piece of advice. To be fair (trying to find the good) there is no reason to question the cleanliness or decent location of the establishment, but beyond that keep your expectations on the lower end and you can get by.Second time here and ended poorly like the first. My wife, who is deaf, has a service animal which resulted in the entire restaurant staff not giving us service, blatantly. After presenting correct identification for our dog, we were still given discontent over our presence. Looks like a nice place but the staff definitely needs some work.I stayed this weekend at the Market Pavilion Hotel.  Once arriving they have very little space for you to pull up and valet your car but it works out just fine.  The check in was easy peezy, and the staff was friendly.  Like others have said they have 2 elevators which because of the massive lines for the rooftop bar can be kind of a pain if you simply want to go to your room.The room was nice.  Beds are VERY comfy, and they have plenty of outlets for all of your charging needs.  The showers were also nice as they had some great water pressure going on, I didn't really want to get out.  The chamber maids were a bit peculiar when they rang the doorbell (yes, every room has a doorbell) and asked us if we needed the turn down service.  2 ladies that spoke very little English asking questions of guests turned a little awkward.  Each floor has breakfast laid out every morning with nice muffins, pastries and coffee.  They also have the NY Times available which was nice to have on a Sunday morning.The cost of the rooms are high, which is to be expected.  What you get is a comfy room, and great location to all of the cool places in town.This review is ONLY on the rooftop bar and it's my favorite rooftop bar in town!  Yes, the drinks are pricy at $5/beer.  In my group, we ordered Coors, Blue Moon, Guinness, and Mich Ultra--all $5 each.  Beware that the beer is not served in real glasses.  This may be a fairly recent change.  I hadn't been there in over 6 months prior to last weekend and don't recall plastic cups in the past.  The cups looks like pint glasses; they aren't red Solo cups.  Also, my Blue Moons weren't filled to the top.  This may be because they pour from bottles.  Now that the negatives are out of the way...  Of course, there is a fantastic view of the peninsula and Ravenel Bridge.  Aside from that, you can actually TALK to other people.  The pop music played is at a nice level.  I much prefer being able to connect with people on a deeper level rather than have artificial small talk with a lot of different people.  Last weekend was chilly in the low 50's and there was high glass railing to block the nippy wind.  Had I known that previously, I may've frequented the bar over the Fall/Winter.I wouldn't call the wait staff overly friendly but they are not rude.  If anything, they are efficient and attentive.We didn't eat here; only got drinks. The offerings are somewhat limited, but when you have a view of downtown Charleston like this, I personally don't really care. I ordered a margarita. You have to be patient while waiting for a table, but again I think it's worth it. Go for the view and enjoy the atmosphere.Spent two nights at Pavilion this week.  Great service hotel.  Friendly staff helpful and always recognized the guests.  The restaurant downstairs is a Charleston favorite and the rooftop bar offers the best views and ambience in the area.   Coffee and pastries on your floor every morning save a trip downstairs or to Starbucks.  Rooms are tasteful and a good value for Charleston historical district.So I read about this place online and heard it was the place to be. It wasn't crowded Sunday night but the views were awesome!My sweet tea martini was good and the Chocolate cookie desert was on point! Make sure you sit in Raquel's section of the rooftop bar! She's amazing and was very delightful. Super informative and extremely friendly!One of the finest establishments around.  Rooftop bar offers great view of the Charleston Harbor and City of Charleston as well as Mt. Pleasant Patriots Point.  The steak at Grill 225 is one of the best in the city.  Highly Recommended.Gorgeous accommodations, convenient location, friendly and attentive staff. Had a great time during our weekend stay here. The rooftop pool is amazing. Amanda Wimbish in the parlor was especially excellent. Definitely recommend staying here while you're in Charleston.We only had drinks on the rooftop, but it was so much fun and chill. Definitely recommend.Skip the $450/night prices at the poshest hotels in town and get a $200/night room rate here in the off season.  The staff is very eager to please and perks abound.  I unknowingly caught a special and got a $50 food/drink certificate to use on premises when I checked into the hotel.  Valet parking, the norm for downtown hotels, runs $20.  Hermes supplies the bath goodies.  Complimentary New York Times are supplied, wifi is free, and the business ""center""--a desktop- allows printing without for no charge.  Rooms have a tub and a separate shower, and are spacious.  The hotel is spotless and the hallways have an unidentifiable but distinctive smell that says ""pampered.""  The theme of the decor (i.e., typical Charleston) is not my personal style but the rooms/halls/reception areas are very well appointed and maintained.There is a gym with free weights and exercise machines, and a rooftop bar that provides a neat vantage point from the epicenter of downtown, right above the historic Charleston market.  In the morning, pastries and coffee are provided in the hallway by the elevator.  There is no in-room mini-bar, safe, or i-phone/ipod player.  The bed and pillows were as comfortable as any hotel in which I've stayed.  In the shower, hot water was hot and unlimited and the water pressure was terrific.  Back to my gift certificate... it didn't go far-- I got a glass of Veuve Clicquot ($23) and a tuna tartare tower app ($19).  The tuna was good but the avocado in it was tinged brown, as though it had been pre-made some hours before and tucked in the fridge.  I went elsewhere for my real dinner.  I will be back to this property, no question!Note that several negative reviews on Yelp under the hotel's listing are by folks who have not stayed in the hotel and thus  mis-filed-- they refer to the Pavilion Bar on the roof, not the hotel accommodations.","For the pavillion rooftop bar. Amazing views. The price of drinks is a bit high, but worth it for the ambiance. The service varies, but I've never witness a horrible service. If you have friends in town, it's worth taking them to see the city from birds eye view. It's nice to see all of the church roof tops. They also have heaters during the winter nights.I reserved this place for my sister's wedding present. She said she enjoyed the place but that she did not have confidence in the staff. From my second opinion, she was quite accurate.My gripes:- I reserved it under my credit card with the impression that this would cover the cost of the room. Apparently not. The groom was forced to pay for the room the night of and I was VERY embarrassed the next morning. At this point I was simply inconvenienced because perhaps I did not read the fine print, or gave the wrong credit card #, or something of that nature.- So I called the day after to refund the groom and pay for it myself. ""Christian"" answered the phone. I explained that a) I wanted to pay for the room and b) I listed my frustrations. He stated that 1) he would email me paperwork to get the payment switched over and 2) a manager would call in regards to my issues. Neither of these things happened. At this point I am now annoyed.- I called the next day after and ""Mia"" was able to assist me properly, in terms of emailing me the paperwork to switch over payment. Thank you Mia.Summary: - I didn't stay there, have heard its a nice location, but serious issues in administrative function seem to exist.I am staying on the concierge floor at $600/night. Great view of the Ravenelle bridge and the custom house across the street and therein lies the rub. A marching band showed up at 11 pm and has been playing for almost an hour. Since I can't sleep and the hotel is powerless to stop it, I am ventilating. Last night, by the way , it was a drum corps. The rooftop bar is lovely but the lobby is full of drunk guys and snotty chicks every night. The elevators are full of drunk sweaty people every night. The room is clean and nicely decorated but I would rather have peace and quiet. But, if you can afford a room fit for a rock star and you party like one, this could be your place. It isn't mineThe wife and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary. What an awesome hotel in a great location and beautiful city. I'm a self proclaimed clean freak....ocd about all things clean and this hotel exceeded my expectations. They were very accomodating when I asked them to arrange for my wife's flowers to be in the room when we arrived, although one of the roses got broken. Not sure if the delivery person broke it or the hotel but not a big deal. The service of the room was top notch as well. Never ran out of towels and room was cleaned even when they came in for turn down. Kim the concierge was awesome! Even took a picture of the wife and I at dinner on our anniversary night at Grill 225, the restaurant inside the hotel.Speaking of Grill 225, this is a great fine dining experience. Thanks to Kim we were served complimentary champagne and then enjoyed a wonderful dinner. We both had filet and they were cooked and flavored perfectly. The rooftop grill and bar is a great experience as well. The view is the best in the city and the drinks although pricey, are great too. The location is right in the heart of everything, a short walk to the battery and all the beautiful scenery that is Charleston. Located right next to the market I thought it would be noisy but it wasn't. We hope to be back real soon!Great view. Only went for drinks. Pricy all the way around. And obviously a hot spot to hang out. Don't be surprised if you have your first few drinks standing while you wait for a table.Was here for a bachelorette party and had to come here for a wonderful drinks and amazing view! JR Yniesta was a doll and made the experience absolutely perfect! Definitely recommend - great drinks, wonderful service and a gorgeous view of the city!If you're looking for the feel of Europe without the jet lag the Market Pavilion Hotel is for you. Romantic, great food, hopping roof top bar with a view and a concierge desk ready and willing to fulfill your needs. 5 stars would have been easy to give to this beautiful hotel IF the fitness center we even slightly up to par. Don't get me wrong, if a lifecycle and treadmill are your requirements, go to town...but if you're looking for a true workout you won't be in luck.But do NOT let the fitness center keep you away! One doesn't travel to Charleston for fitness, we travel here for food, history and good ol' southern hospitality.Ask for JB at 225 Grill and enjoy one of the most professional and quality dining experiences you'll ever get. We will be back.My husband and I chose the MP mostly because it had a pool, which seems a rarity in historic Charleston. The hotel was exquisite and staff was extremely accommodating. The property is within walking distance of all downtown attractions.  We spent most of afternoons on the rooftop pool/ Pavillion Bar and luckily had $50 drink/ food coupons to spend on $15 mojitos that weren't even that great. The service was excellent and the waitresses were always checking in with us or even bringing by cold wet towels. Overall, if you are looking for an upscale hotel in the historic district, this is your hotel.I have not stayed at this hotel. However we went to grill 225, it's restaurant, last night.  We were very disappointed in that they actively offer several differentlobster dishes and that was the primary reason to go there. At 830, they were already out of them and we were disappointed and decided not to stay. The hotel manager, Peter Wright, however this morning heard about this and went out of his way to find me on linked in. And asked me to reconsider his restaurant. We haven't eaten there yet.  That will be tonite. But, I wanted to show this on the hotel yelp to show people what it is like when hotel mgmt understands the importance of good service. Thank you Peter.Bugs, damp room, &amp; understaffed. We were highly disappointed and do not recommend. Our first experience was the front desk attendant who was not at all friendly. She did not give me the food and beverage voucher - After she gave us the key, I had to ask about the vouchers. She had them sent to our room shortly after. We walked into our room to find our toilet running and unable to flush. We reported it but were able to fix it ourselves before the maintenance man got to the room. The room felt damp and had a musty smell, a moisture was in the room that we believe gave us a sore throat the next morning and made it hard to sleep. The air wasn't working. It was about 7 degrees warmer than the temperature set. There were small bugs in the room (looked like fleas, but I'm not totally sure what they were....we felt like we were getting bitten all night). Our sleep was so awful that we woke up around 5:00 to leave. We just wanted to get out of there. When we called to get our car in the morning, the front desk attendant said he was the ONLY staff there and that it would be about 15 minutes before he could get our car. He seemed frustrated on the phone. There was no turn down service or any extras that typically come with higher priced hotels (at least not that we knew about). The rooftop bar was nice but tortilla chips that come with duck nachos were stale. Really disappointed overall and wish we would have chosen French Quarter Inn or Wentworth. I received a call from the general manager after my complaints and tried calling him back last week....I still have not gotten a call back.Hotel was beautiful but the staff couldn't have been worse. First, they changed our reservation for two queen beds to one king and said there weren't any other two queen bedrooms available. They didn't have any cots and said they'd give us another room for $299 a night, thanks but no thanks. Then we asked the maid if she could get us a coffee cup and she replied that it ""wasn't her job."" For the amount of money you pay to stay in this place you would think the staff would go above and beyond to make their guests happy but that definitely was not the case.Probably a 3.75 if I could give that rating. Good service and rooftop bar is great. Nice valet and concierge service that bumps it up from 3 stars. Would stay here again.Went in person to book accommodations for the wknd on Thursday night. The gentleman who provided us rates and availability asked that we go online or call back to book the room we wanted because he said, ""I've worked with better systems in my life than this computer system."" We agreed to call. The bellhop also inquired about our plans and we discussed the great rate offering and the fact that we were switching to Market Pavilion. Called back Friday morning and, low and behold, the rates we were quoted had doubled! I explained that we wanted to book in person the previous night but were unable to--due to the desk attendant. That didn't phase today's attendant one bit. ""Well our rates fluctuate daily but he could also have been mistaken."" Why, if we definitely wanted the room/rate, would we be told to put off booking if they would likely change? What rubbish customer service! If you want a truly lavish experience Charleston Place Belmond can't be matched. Pavillion Bar is great but the hotel staff beneath it don't maintain the same customer experience.After driving straight through from Milwaukee to Charleston, some friends surprised us by taking us out on the town to celebrate out arrival.First stop was the Market Pavilion Hotel's Rooftop Bar, where the staff greeted us and directed us to the table that had been reserved for us.  The night was a bit chilly; but the hotel had plenty of heaters to ensure that everyone was comfortable. The view was wonderful.  The rooftop pool looked inviting.  The music, mixed by a DJ, was upbeat.Our server, I think her name was Lori, was waiting to take our cocktail orders.  The cocktails arrived promptly.  I had a margarita, which was delicious.  I forget what everyone else had ordered; but everyone in our party was very pleased with what they ordered.We decided to order some food.  Lori  suggested the Duck Confit Nachos.  We also ordered the Steak Quesadillas.  Both arrived in a timely manner.  It was explained to us, that the steak in the quesadillas was made up from the trimmings from the prime steaks that they serve in the hotel restaurant. Consequently, the steak in our quesadillas was some of the most tender that I've ever had!  The Duck Confit Nachos were even tastier!  You could tell that the cheese sauce was made from scratch... just the right amount of spiciness!  Another nice thing about the nachos was that the tortilla chips were made of blue corn, rather than the usual yellow or white corn.  I don't know if blue corn tortilla taste any better than the others; the difference was evident though, in the presentation.... the dark blue chips, with the pale creamy color of the queso cheese and the mouth watering duck on top!  Delicious!While we were enjoying our cocktails, we had the opportunity to talk with the hotel manager, Peter Wright (not sure of the spelling), and the beverage manager, Gerald.  Both were very friendly and made sure that we were pleased with everything.  We all had a second round of drinks, and headed to our second location.We weren't staying at the Market Pavilion; but my friends and I were certainly treated as if we were guests of the hotel.  If I'm ever back in Charleston, and need a hotel room, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here.  If my experience at the bar is any indication of what my hotel experience would be like, It would probably turn out to be one of my best hotel experiences ever!Love this hotel! This is where we stay every time we come. Rooftop is the best! The people that work there are so nice and friendly.I love staying here. It is really nice without being stuffy. I like staying on the concierge floor, food, drinks, available 24/7. The restaurant is topnotch , the pool/bar on the rooftop is really spectacular( only improvement I would suggest is they need hot toddies on cool days and nights, they don't do any ""hot drink"").  Hotel is more of a boutique style hotel, in a historic building. Located directly next to the market.Our stay was great! We had a couple hiccups when we arrived: cars were parked on the whole block in front of the hotel so it was impossible to valet. At the same time that we were calling to complain, a valet flagged us down and said that he noticed we had circled the block a couple (3) times. He grabbed the keys and we went inside. At the desk, they told us to come back in an hour (we were early, they told us to come back at the actual check in time) and we were ""guaranteed"" our room. They should have picked their words more carefully. We arrived almost 2 hours later to our room not ready. After some suggesting, we were given a free round of drinks at the bar. Levi was very sweet. I'm not sure if he ever has a day off, but he's a great bartender and they're lucky to have him. The room was comfy, bathroom was spacious and turn down service is always a nice touch. Every employee we encountered was friendly and helpful. It is definitely a little pricier, but the service was worth it and the $50 food and beverage credit nightly was a nice touch. Location is great.Sat at the top bar on the roof.  Ordered 4 total mixed drinks for about $65 with tip...WTF?!  I guess this place is ""Old Charleston,"" and can charge a ridiculous amount.  Lori, our waitress from GA, was sweet and caring.  She gave us good service and recommendations.  I really like the strawberry and kiwi mojito!If you are looking for a elitist atmosphere with overpriced drinks, a feeling that money is the only way to get respect and bouncers with over the top attitude complexes, this is perfect for you.This restaurant and hotel sells itself as a better life but it really isn't.If you don't have a collared shirt, you can't walk in.If you have sandals, you can't walk in but your date can.There are so many better upscale places that will treat you with more respect in Charleston than this.If you want a roof top bar, go to The Library at Vendue.You will have a much better time.Or Henry's.My friend and I visited the Pavillion Roof top Bar on a Saturday in October at around lunch time. We had a little sticker shock, but we were prepared based on what we knew. We had two Blue Moons and an order of the Duck Nachos. We left spending $16 pp before tip, which wasn't actually too bad.I don't know if it was because we were catching up for the first time in a while, the weather was perfect, we were at a roof top bar or their beer is special but they were hands down the two best Blue Moons we've ever had. I think Charleston makes things taste better!The duck nachos were $19, but they're worth it! The base is a bed of blue corn tortillas that are served warm and crispy. The duck goes on next. It's cooked to a crisp perfection and then served covered in a slightly spicy queso. My nose was definitely running a bit from the spice. But, it was well worth it!Our server left a little bit to be desired. He was slow to check on us and the one water refill we got was forced. However, the atmosphere made it hard to be anything but happy. If you're visiting and treating yourself, I'd defintiely recommend a visit!","Truly an European hotel in the heartOf a great southern city. The staff was exceptional. The  Suzann and Kim were more than helpful;  Ravon was also  great. Food was excellent with extremely large portions. I would advise sharing. Steaks were prime and wonderfully seasoned. Desserts were beautiful and sooooo great-- chocolate mouse is to die for. Rooftop bar and pool is a real treat. Rooms were huge with fabulous linens and elegantly decorated. I would suggest you book the concierge level. As an added bonus you receive a voucher for  $50 a day for food or drinks to be spent at the hotel. We loved this  hotelFavorite hotel in Charleston - something special.  Awesome steakhouse Grille 225 in lobby, great rooftop bar, people are great.  Ambiance is amazing and uniquely Charleston.The staff was wonderful.  The room, a corner L shape suite, was huge and the bed was perfect.  The people couldn't have been nicer.  Rooftop has great views of the water.  If you're on the concierge level, you get tea time everyday and small sandwiches and cheese, wine and beer at night.  Really a perfect place for a getawayI did not stay here, but had drinks both at the lobby lounge and at the rooftop lounge.   The ambiance of both is great....the lobby bar is full of nice wood and southern style furnishings while the rooftop bar is modern/stylish and ample.    Great views of the river and the historic district from above.    All staff seemed very friendly and eager to please.   A great spot ....right by the City Market.We spent nearly $300 a night to stay here with a $50 credit and were happy to do so with our high expectations of what the hotel would offer. The hotel is located in the touristy part of Market Street. The stores are littered with junk, children are allowed to panhandle on the sidewalks,  and the streets smell of horse poop and pee.  I would never have stayed here had I been more familiar with the city.Since the hotel's site listed check-in at 3 p.m., I requested an early check-in at 10 a.m. and understood that it could not be guaranteed.  The staff member mentioned that if the room was not available, we could make use of the rooftop pool.  That idea sounded just as sufficient as getting into our room early so we did not fret about the issue again until our arrival at the hotel.The hotel's ""taxi"" partner is the most expensive car service in the entire town, charging $50 for a trip to the hotel (the normal, which we made our own accommodations for on the way back was closer to $30). The white SUV which picked us up was extrememly dated and had stained, old leather seats.  Our driver, however, was extremely welcoming and offered a mini-tour as we traveled the 12 miles out to our hotel. The front desk told us they would call once a room became available.  We decided to go with our plan B of changing and going to the rooftop pool.  That's where the hotel experience slowly began to deteriorate, FAST.  The hotel has many rooms, most of which accommodate 2-6 guests per night.  We were shocked to find that only 12 lounge chairs were available at the pool upon our arrival at 10:00 a.m. TWELVE! Two of which were completely shaded. One family took up the entire back row, and no one was eager to give up their 3 saved chairs next to them for their friends or relatives that hadn't made it up to the pool yet.  Feeling defeated we decided to order a drink to wait it out. Only problem was that the bar didn't open until 11:30.  There were only 12 available towels, so we couldn't even grab a towel, take a dip, and then and sit at one of the 12-15 tables that were set up around the rooftop with a shaded umbrella. Around 12:30, we were able to stalk a couple who was leaving and jump at the opportunity to grab the two chairs they were giving up.  We also simultaneously ordered lunch and a drink.  The drink was really warm, and served in a classy plastic glass that should have been thrown out at the end of last season and was chipped on the rim (seriously these glasses MAY have cost a max of $2, if not purchased at the dollar store).  The $15 sunriser was followed by a $17 poolside chicken salad and a $12 chips and salsa. When the salad came out, I literally laughed out loud. The 5 pieces of once-frozen chicken breast were beyond dry and sprinkled with pepper only.  The avocado was not sliced, it was literally mush and turning brown; and the dressing, which we requested on the side, was drenched over every piece of soggy lettuce in the bowl.  But even the salad was impressive in comparison to the chips and salsa.  The STALE chips and not-even-tostitos-brand jarred salsa was a JOKE. When we complained we were told they could have the cook make a batch of fresh chips- UM, why didn't you do that the first time around? No, thanks.At 2:45 we went back to the front desk because we were dying to grab our luggage and explore the town.  The front desk associate flat out lied to us saying that she had just ""left us a voicemail not too long ago"" .  There was no voicemail, because she never called, but nonetheless she provided us with our room keys and told us that bell service would bring up our bags right away.  An hour and two phones calls later, an extremely friendly, but overworked bellman arrived at our room. The room was not even the slightest bit impressive. The neutral carpet had a huge black stain where the windows were and smelled musty and sour.  The beds were clean, at least, and comfortable.  The Hermes products were the most awful smelling things I've ever had to use and the conditioner did not even begin to detangle my long hair. That night we were carded at the entrance 3 separate times to re-enter the building since they open the rooftop bar to outsiders. That was a nightmare, to say the least. In summary: the management is atrocious; the main bartender (an older, unpleasant, gentleman) called my friend ""girl"" when greeting her;  the matron of the hotel who sat at the elevators gossiped with the main housekeeper in front of guests; the staff joked that they hated their jobs working on ""the plantation"" getting lashings for their bad behavior;  and the GM introduced himself to every group at the pool on our last day to ask about their stay - passing up our obviously young looks to personally meet all those 45 and older, as we clearly weren't good enough for his time. If I had to offer advice, I would tell you to take your business elsewhere. This place is a pathetic excuse for top-of-the-line hotel service.$500 a night, you get what you pay for, if you use it. As you get to your room, yes a doorbell on the outside. Umbrella awaits your arrival in the closet with housecoat and slippers. Fuji waters (no charge). Average size room and bathroom, by the way there is scales if you need to know your weight. Fruit tray right outside your room. Try the off season would not mind it for $200-250 per night. If you stay look into the added value for a price for free snacks and wine in the afternoon. Did not find out about this until we had checked in. Maybe with this the room would be worth the price. Oh almost forgot the bellman is amazing, I do enjoy his humor.Stayed here three nights  for a wedding during beginning of October 2013. Pros: great location in historic district, close to everything; large room, comfortable bed, good water pressure in shower. Helpful and friendly door men out front. Decent number of cable channels.Not so great: Valet parking only as far as we could tell. There's very little parking in the area.Housekeeping was less than we expected for a $400/night room. On one day we had to request that our room be made up, as housekeeping had not come to it, even though we left the ""Service"" sign on our door. They never gave us new soap; they never replaced the provided water bottles.  When I asked about these things, I was told they don't replace the soap until it is gone. Their explanation prompted me to note how much water was left in my wife's water bottle. There was barely an ounce. So, no new water bottle.The rooftop bar is overpriced just like the lobby restaurant. The drinks were weak, and two drinks plus tax and tip will run you $25. The fitness center is small, but the equipment is top quality. The pool was really cold.  Most people just sat on their lounge chairs  and drank or sun-bathed as they read the provided NYT. The elevators to get to the roof are very slow.  There are no stairs for guests (I asked). It was very busy every time we went up there.  maybe that explains why service was so slow.Summary: if you are made of money and/or want just want to be in the center of the historic district, this is the place to be.  It is certainly not a value.  I think I am being generous by rating it at three stars.We love hanging at the hotel bar just to the left of the front door.  Perfect spot for people watching and sipping on Nitrotinis.   The service here is always solid and the vibe just right.   With the full menu available, we've noshed on shrimp cocktail and Caesar salad, both scrumptious.  And the Pavilion Roof top Bar affords a perfect view of the lovely city.Loved this place!!! It was in a fantastic location, the rooms were clean, comfortable, and roomy, the staff was super friendly and accommodating, and we loved the morning coffee &amp; pastries on each floor for breakfast. Such a treat!!!  The rooftop bar was also awesome! Great view, atmosphere, and cocktails. I would absolutely stay here again &amp; recommend it to anyone!The Good:My husband abhors rooms with connecting doors. Seriously will throw down about it. We requested a room without connecting doors when we booked, but as with most hotels, this request is rarely heeded. We got up to our room, saw the door and called down for a new room, which was quickly provided. We always seem to forget to ask if the room is a connector when we check in. You  would think I would remember considering how many times I've sat in hotel hallways waiting for a staff member to come up and help us to a new room, but I don't.We received $50 vouchers for each night to utilize at their bar and restaurant, which we gladly did.Turn down service was a fun luxury I have never watched before. We happened to be in the room when the housekeeper arrived to do it, and she was meticulous in her duty.There was an in-room safe. I love safes.Fantastic service from every staff member. I love when people actually act like they care about their jobs and want to make their patrons happy.There were doorbells for each room. For some reason this seemed extra fancy and made me deliriously happy.Potty phone. If you are still going to bother with a land line, it best be while you are doing the potty dance.The location is prime for anyone hoping to stay within walking distance of downtown Charleston's attractions.The Not So Good:Our view was of the parking lot. Not gorgeous, but I did learn how they bring the valeted cars up onto their deck. They have a car elevator. Who knew?On Saturday evening, we called down to order from the to be expected overpriced room service menu. They were out of at least one ingredient for every dish we requested. When I finally asked her what they might actually have on the menu, the operator stated that because it was Restaurant Week, they were out of many options because they had so many reservations that night for Grill 225. The kicker was that our order would have taken an hour to be delivered all the way up to third floor. Sounds like poor planning to me. We canceled our order and went to Slightly North of Broad instead. They were also in the middle of Restaurant Week but had no problem fitting us in without a reservation at their chef's table.Review is for the hotel! We paid $450.00 a night for a decent room and great location it's the only thing this hotel has to offer. Oh and nitrogen martinis in restaurant downstairs! Lol.  Our view was literally looking at cars less than a foot from our window and we were on second floor. I could basically open the window and touch the car parked. The service from housekeeping is horrendous we only had turn down service once out of 3 nights!! They never picked up the garbage not even the stale cookies from the one night of turn down service. The elevator was down and made line so long luckily we could take the stairs. They should have opened up the service elevator to the public, but they didn't even consider it. I actually took service elevator to our friends floor and was scolded by a Hskpr.  The elevator still wasn't fixed when checking out a few days later.  Keep in mind rooftop is popular so made it a mess for people who couldn't take the stairs on higher levels or had bags to carry. I think there is better hotels for the money!!We have stayed here about 5 times and each time this hotel has been consistent in its great service and room. They have a great bar restaurant on the roof and even in the hot weather it always seems cooler up there. They serve coffee on every floor in the morning with the most delicious pastry I have ever tasted. The only down side is that they serve your drinks on the roof bar in plastic cups because of the pool being close by. This place is close to everything downtown and don't forget to take in a River Dogs game (The Yankees Single At Team) its a fun nite and only costs a couple bucks. Your kids will love it as much as you.We stayed here for 3 nights. What can I possibly say. If you are up in the air about staying here, STOP. Book your room and thank yourself later. The staff was phenomenal in everything from the valet to the waitstaff at the pool/bar on the rooftop.  I will recommend this hotel to all of my friends. It is simply the best in Charleston.We have stayed here four years running. We have had stellar service and wonderful rooms. We have never, ever experienced the unfortunate situations that some of the reviewers had. I don't understand what happened to them. We have drinks at the Pavillion Bar and the bartenders are terrific. Friendly and quick to serve. I think one is Jr. Way to go. The downstairs Grill 225 is the ultimate best.  JB is our favorite wait staff person. Steaks are over the top. We will be back again this year and are looking forward to the friendliest staff and service we have had in the previous years. It keeps us coming back. We could stay at any other place, but we get treated so well here, why bother. Our rooms are always clean and very comfortable. Love the coffee/tea and French pastries in the morning. Complimentry of course. If we don't continue to have the best experience, we sure hope that those in charge will do their utmost best to correct any issues we may encounter.I have been coming to this bar for 10 Years! I Was told tonite that my sandals were not up To dress code! Let's see: IT IS CHARLESTONAnd it's 100!!! Also expensive Steve Maddem SandalsAnd line pants! But blue jeans and sneakers We're fine for some type of people.I was told by doorman that my problem was not enoughTo call the manager. I called her on the phone andREBECCA, let me know that my years of patronageAnd money were not worth her ime andTried to hang up on me.I will never go there again and I would advise the Same to anyone else.Did not stay in the hotel but I did visit the rooftop bar which I must say is pleasantly beautiful! Tall fire pits next to every table keeps you toasty on a cool night. Beautiful pool and a very nice bar. Very pricey though for such mediocre food and drinks. I only ordered an appetizer because the limited rooftop menu only offered sandwiches which were too costly, and $22 (or more) salads! My appetizer was $19 and my martini was $13! Chips w/ salsa cost a whopping $9! My appetizer of Satay Shrimp was nothing to write home about...beautiful display of shrimp (4 jumbo shrimp) but short on flavor with a side of diced fruit which tasted like refrigerator (?) which is the best way I know how to describe the flavor...I guess like freezer burn. Not so good salsa cost me $5 with a side of blue tortilla chips for $4...blah! (didn't know you could go wrong with chips and salsa. My Martini was tasty but not $13 tasty...especially seeing as how I had stopped in at a little dive bar on the way, and ordered the exact same drink (but tastier) for $3!  Maybe it tasted better because it was only $3? Anywho, I never mind spending money as long as it's worth my while and this just wasn't. $65 bucks for nothing memorable!2 stars for beautiful spot but the food is not worth the price!okay, another first for me today. can't believe that there isnt a review for this hotel. i think because so many patrons are older and dont use yelp.this hotel is one of the best. right in the heart of charleston, great restaurant in lobby and at rooftop bar. the bar is a great place to be period. my children loved everything about the market pavilion hotel. the rooms are pure luxury and the pastries/breakfast served at certain levels is fabulous. its everything you would want in a small hotel and more. splurge and stay here.We just came back from a long weekend in Charleston at the Market Pavilion hotel. It is a very nice hotel in a great location with nice amenities, but just seems to be missing in some ways. Pros:LocationDoormen were extremely friendly and helpfulwelcome email a few days before our visit asking to help us with reservationsFront desk staff very friendlyValet parkingbeautiful rooftop barCons:Unfriendly bar tenders in the Pavilion barNONE of the heaters on the rooftop bar work (?!)water for tea was never hotter than luke warm Some of the staff was extremely warm and friendly and tried to help in any way they could. Others (mainly bartenders) were overly pretentious. The bar area seating (3 small tables plus some stools at the bar) were full, but they had a couple of comfortable chairs with a small table just outside the bar area so we sat there. Several times we tried to get the attention of the guy who was waiting on the bar tables and he very obviously refused to look at us. We finally asked a waiter from the restaurant as he was going by if we could get service there and he said no, you can only get service if you are seated at one of the actual bar tables so we would need to go to the bar. When we did go to the bar, the bartender acted like he was doing us a favor by serving us at all. They should be going out of their way to make us want to come back, but they didn't. In fact, it turned us off so much that we decided not to have dinner at the steak house there. The valets and the porters on the other hand couldn't have been more helpful. We had drinks at the rooftop bar the first night and they have beautiful heaters beside every table. It was chilly out so we asked if they would turn our heater on. We were told that ALL of the heaters were broken! I think that the starters on the heaters might be broken, but they need to learn how to light them with a lighter! We didn't go back up there after that experience.  They have a really nice happy hour in the concierge lounge with beer/wine/champagne and appetizers. It is a really nice champagne and the appetizers were all excellent. You could have easily made a meal from them!  They also have a nice breakfast but being a tea drinker, there is nothing worse than luke warm water for tea, and that is all I was ever able to get there. So net, it's a really nice hotel that is just missing being a great hotel. When we go back we will probably try another option.High gilt frame decor might turn off some but I found it a welcome vacation. The food and drink on the fourth floor at breakfast and tea time was a constant delight. Staff friendly. Location lovely. Room large and comfortable. Only downside: workout room from 1981.Just did a few nights here, being a regular patron of the Leading Hotels of the World, there is a level of service we've come accustomed to and this place didn't disappoint us at all, everyone seemed friendly and helpful. It does help to keep a few fives and singles folded and ready to grease the wheels but in a few cases it wasn't wholly expected. The downstairs bar is well stocked although the rooftop bar a little less so, the $50 food and beverage voucher got us started in the right mood. I would have enjoyed the pool a bit more if it were just a tad warmer but the windbreaks definitely made the roof a big draw. We stayed on the concierge level which came in handy with 24 hour access to sodas and water in the parlor that served continental breakfast and afternoon hors d'oeuvres daily. The location couldn't be better, across the street from the 'straw market' and the French Quarter a few short blocks the other direction with easy access to the water..","During a recent stay at The Market Pavilion Hotel in Charleston, South Carolina I was rather surprised by the treatment I received from the hotel staff. The Market Pavilion Hotel's membership as a Leading Hotel of the World and its rating as a AAA four diamond hotel lead to certain expectations for levels of service. My recent stay is actually one of the worst hotel stays that I have ever experienced and leads me to question the rest of the members of Leading Hotels of the World.I have stayed in hotels from Fujairah to Curacao and hundreds within the US. I typically stay in small luxury hotels such as Hotel Providence in Providence, Rhode Island or the Waldorf Astoria, but I do stay in large brand name hotels such as the Ritz Carleton from time to time. I search out hotels excelling in customer service and will rarely make a reservation that is not at the club or concierge level when it is available. None of the hotels I have named are members of the elite group ""Leading Hotels of the World"", but the Market Pavilion Hotel is.I was appalled by several things which should never have occurred in a hotel of this level. This hotel has numerous issues, from poor customer service and a complete lack of managerial ability on the part of the General Manager and Behind Desk Manager to poor cleanliness standards.  The first and foremost issue I experienced upon arrival was the restaurant service at the Pavilion Bar. It took over 30 minutes for me to be seated which I can understand, but it was another hour and a half before I was brought a menu and another beverage. The older couple sitting by me waited for over an hour for a pair of cocktails. We couldn't even get the attention of any of the staff members to complain which was further compounded by the ""Free-for-all"" seating style adopted by the Pavilion bar. Had any of us gotten up to go find a manager, we would have lost our table to any of the 20 people waiting for seats.I called down to the first floor Concierge to inquire about reservations at the Grill 225 located in the hotel. The response from the Concierge was ""there's no way you're getting in there until early next week."" In my experience there is a very fine line between being sassy and being rude. While playful banter is fun and appreciated, I have never stayed at a hotel where it was acceptable for hotel staff to be blatantly rude to a hotel guest, especially when that guest is a concierge level guest.It seems that the above issues are all common place and acceptable at the Market Pavilion Hotel. When I went to the front desk to ask for a manager to complain, after introducing myself, I was told that the manager on duty was one of the food and beverage managers and that they would have him contact me in my room as they were un-available at that time. If that's not enough of an issue, when I received the phone call in my room it was by a young man named Grant who introduced himself as the Behind Desk Manager. In addition to being a different person that I was told I would be talking to, Grant provided no useful input to the situation as the only course of action that he volunteered was to apologize for my inconvenience and offer to tell someone else in management.At that point in my stay, I was sufficiently annoyed that I started writing my review. I went to the Concierge lounge where Hour-devoirs were being served to write while I sipped on a glass of wine. When Mr. Gary Cohen the General Manager came up, he did not shake my hand, introduce himself or even acknowledge my presence when he walked within two feet of where I was seated. As I found out later from Suzanne, he was there to find out who Mr. Cochran was and why he was complaining to the front desk manager.Anyone who is not appalled at this point will find it interesting to know that this all occurred during the first 36 hours of my stay. I was in residence for 5 nights and at the time that this is written a week after I checked in to the hotel, I have still not been contacted by Mr. Cohen or anyone able to offer a better explanation that ""Im sorry for your inconvenience.""Further issues with the hotel were noted during my stay. The ""cascading pool"" had large amounts of dirt on the bottom and hair floating throughout the pool. There were no pool towels available on the pool deck when I went swimming despite the hotel claiming that ample pool towels were provided for the use of guests. Nowhere did I see any indication that the Market Pavilion Hotel should be included in the Leading Hotels of the World other than in the concierge parlor. I strongly recommend that all reviewing agencies put this hotel under intense scrutiny. I strongly advise any travelers venturing to Charleston, SC to stay at one of the other amazing properties in the area and stay as far from the Market Pavilion Hotel as possible, it will only ruin your experience. If you insist on staying, stay on the concierge level and tell Suzanne that Ken Cochran sent you.Just spent 4 days here on a journey through the Southeast. Our room was excellent for the price. Very comfortable with a nice bed-key for me- and every other aspect was delightful. It is a little strange to walk through the bar and restaurant to get to your room, but everything else is wonderful. For the price, this is a great spot  convenient to the heart of Charleston, and walking distance to most everything.  This is a mpdern hotel so it is very comfortable,  with great beds and linens and space that you don't find in period hotels. It was a joyu to wake up and find freshly brewed coffee and a pile of fresh pastries on our floor.  We didn't eat at the 225 restaurant, but it looked very good.  We spent several hours on the rooftop bar and really enjoyed it. Our room reservation came with a $50/day credit toward food and booze, so I splurged on the $19 nitrotinis a couple days, and the $24 filet kebab appetizer. Don't think I would do the nitrotinis on my own nickel, but the filet was a meal and a darn great one. I definitely recommend it despite its cost.All of the staff was helpful and attentive.I would not hesitate to stay here on my next trip to Charleston.This us a great hotel. Wifi bad but I work too much anyway. Paying 199 which is very reasonable - includes 50 restaurant voucher plus free coffee/Danish.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-historic-charleston-charleston,Embassy Suites Historic Charleston,3.0,$$$,66,"This place is really nice!They serve breakfast, complimentary afternoon happy hour drinks, and have coffee out all the time!The atrium area is very pretty. The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable. One quibble:  the rooms are numbered weirdly.  I get there's a mezzanine floor, but why does it share similar numbers to the first regular floor?  That's silly.   Overall, if you're looking to stay in a place that's convenient to all the cool places in Charleston, this is a place you should stay at.Do not stay at this hotel unless you want to feel like you you are staying in a prison cell.  The hotel is dark, dirty, sparsely furnished and the bed is awful.  I woke up with leg cramps from bracing myself against rolling into the middle.   The rooms have very small windows and many have brick walls...hence the prison reference.  There  is construction on all sides, so it is dirty, dusty and noisy.  It is also a least a mile from everywhere you want to go.  I called the front desk and complained about the darkness of the room and was told that the building can't be renovated because it is on the historical register.  Not sure that explains why there are tiles missing in the shower, the hot and cold water are reversed and one of the sinks didn't drain.   On a bright note, the cooked to order breakfast was good and the staff were friendly and accommodating.I would never stay at this hotel again and wish I didn't have to ruin my trip to Charleston by staying there the first time.Loud construction at 7:39 am. Management blamed me for doing an e-check-in. Never againUpdate~General manager called me the next day and apologized, gave me some free Hilton points. Made some effort to take care of  a Hilton Diamond member.Just completed a one week stay at this hotel on 9/11/15.  All in all, just okay.  If you've stayed at other Embassy Suite hotels, this may be a little less than what you expect in terms of the ambiance and amenities.  Pro'sCentral locationFree breakfast and daily happy hourAttentive service (front desk, housekeeping, valet)Con'sVery dim interior throughout, particularly in the roomsParking is off siteGym only has one treadmill and one elliptical machineSuper small poolI feel I need to update this review... After emailing the staff at embassy suites with my feelings and reviews, two days after returning from my wedding and stay at embassy suites, I received an email from their manager stating she intended on sending gift cards to me for a stay anywhere of my choice with embassy suites. 2 weeks have passed and I have not heard anything nor received anything from embassy suites !Hmmm... I was a little skeptical by some of the mixed reviews, but I decided to give this hotel a shot anyway. If you're reading this review, don't be discouraged by the 3 star rating.. it's just that this is an older hotel and I'm used to a little more.... class. I mean honestly, when riding up the elevator... the inside interior made me think of the movie Scarface... like any minute some assassins were going to come thru and shoot the place up... it's just really outdated. BUT! This place is decent. The bed was aight, nothing great. And if you are viewing the pics I took, well we were pretty much staying in the equivalent of a 1 bedroom apt. I mean you can't really get any better than this as far as space. I liked it, because my dude and I need to regroup sometimes... alone. So it was great. The hotel was quiet and the staff were friendly enough. Oddly enough there was water in our room when we stepped out for a bit. Didn't expect this as we had all of our things laid out. Not sure where this came from. Any ""extras"" I receive (because I'm a Hilton Honors guest) are normally given when I arrive. Going into my room unannounced is not really cool, but luckily all of our electronics were still in place. Parking is $16 if you park yourself and $22 for using the valet for 24 hours. The parking deck is barely down the street, and I was told you get to come and go as you please in the 24 hours. Perhaps we'll scope out street parking next time. Now I've seen reviews about the breakfast aaaaand again maybe it's because I have stayed in pretty dope hotels (Home 2 in Charlotte)... I mean the breakfast ain't all that! However, it is better than the usual. My omelet was juicy and seasoned well and my potatoes were good but probably because we were there right when they opened for breakfast. The service was good tho. Nice touch with the staff cleaning off tables immediately after a guest left and picking up our plates when it looked like we were finished. Pretty much like a regular restaurant. They serve snacks mid-afternoon: broccoli, carrots and ranch dressing. Warm meatballs. And some sort of trail mix. Also wine... which I was unable to participate in. Now the location of the hotel was what was happening. We were right next to the Food and Wine Festival, and our hotel was not even a block away from Kings street. Hence the prices of this room. So why just 3 stars? I mean I don't want to get your hopes up, leading you to believe you're staying in a bomb hotel. I mean the prices are justified only because of the location... location, location, location. That's really all that matters...well and a clean hotel and it was clean... and quiet. Question is will I stay there again (because we're going back... only 2 1/2 hour drive). Yep, we would stay there again.This place was a huge disappointment. You walk in to a lovely hotel with decent decor. It feels very Tommy Bahama. There's even a cocktail period from 5:30-7:30 with free drinks and snacks. The snacks and drinks were meh, which was expected except for the mini corn dogs...score!  The hotel staff generally doesn't answer the phone or have any knowledgable advice about the city. The pool is small and unattractive. There's a free breakfast, at the cost of you getting to wake up to clinking silverware and kids screaming and running to breakfast at 7am. The sound travels far too well. I could hear every running step over my head. Then on top of all of that there was construction we were not notified of behind the hotel which literally shook our room from 7:50am to past 8pm. I would definitely not stay there again. The lighting was pretty terrible in the room as well.This hotel does not care about its guests. They scheduled significant remodeling during a weekend without any notice to guests. All public venues closed. Extreme noise and dust. I actually felt very sorry for the employees. 9 o'clock on Sunday night it's still going on. Disgraceful.In the case of this hotel, historic means run down. The rooms are sparsely appointed. My one bedroom suite offered a small sofa and one chair. In the bedroom there was only the desk chair for seating even though the room was large enough to hold more. The queen bed was placed against the wall, requiring one person to climb to their side. This hotel needs to update the quality of mattresses and pillows. The lighting in the living room and dining room were poor. The toilet clogged from the first minor usage. On a positive note, the ac worked great- a necessity in the south in the summertime. The hotel staff was friendly and the location is good. It's easy to walk to most downtown attractions. The rooms are pricey on the weekends and I think that's where most of my frustration stems. I'm getting discount hotel quality but paying for a higher end experience. I'll book elsewhere next time I visit Charleston.This hotel earns and deserves negative infinity. It is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed. The front desk management is unqualified and ineffectual, and the housekeeping is disgustingly unskilled. I visited Charleston in July of this year--unfortunately, for my grandmother's funeral. I made a reservation at this Embassy Suites Historic Charleston. I did check-in late in the evening. The hotel was short-staffed. There was no one at valet upon my arrival, and no one at the reservation desk. After waiting for over ten minutes, a gentleman finally came from the back to acknowledge me so that I could check-in. When I got to my room, and pulled back the covers, OUT flew someone's pantyhose. DISGUSTING!!! Clearly, the room had not been cleaned... Aside from the dirty pantyhose in the sheets, there was grime on the floor and spillage on the bar countertops. The manager on duty, tried to vacuum the floor, but didn't have any housekeeping staff on duty to clean the room or change the bedding. To add insult to injury, there were no other rooms available--so he claimed. I ended up having to go to a 24-hour department store, buy an air mattress, and sleep on the floor of my cousin's house. NOT GOOD!!! I will NEVER stay at that hotel ever again. All Hilton Honors did to accommodate me was refund my points back that I used for this stay. However, my experience deserved being granted additional points and/or some complimentary nights towards future stays. What am I going to do with my 900,000 Hilton Honor points?????????????? I do not plan on using this Hilton Honors American Express card ever again... Not only are the benefits terrible, but, I haven't stayed in a decent Hilton hotel in decades. The service has become extremely subpar over the years.I will post the DISGUSTING pictures, as soon as I can get them off my Blackberry...I've stayed in a handful of hotels in downtown and I must say that I love staying here. The rooms are huge, as expected because they're all suites, but there really is a lot of space between the private bedroom and separate living space. Every morning they have a full hot breakfast with choices like cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, bagels, toast, bacon, eggs, sausage, pancakes, and yes... even made to order omelets! I made sure to catch breakfast every morning but if you go at the last minute, like everyone else, you might have to wait a bit or won't find a seat anywhere.In the evenings they also include a free happy hour although I was only able to take advantage once. The staff were excellent and helped me with a few things throughout the week including getting a couple packages delivered and making sure I received them in time. I also needed to spend most of my day in the room and then heading out for ours in the evening for an event. Every day when I left, I would call down and let them know I was heading out and that the room was available to be made up. No matter how quickly I came back, they had already sneaked through like ninjas to put everything back in order, make the beds, and replenish the towel supply.The location couldn't be better being that you're in Marion Square Park when you walk out the side door. You can walk to anything you might need in Charleston including all the bars and restaurants of the Upper King St area or all the shopping and dining of the Lower King area. Most of the historical and more tourist based activities are down by the Market which is very walkable but a rickshaw (bike taxi) or cab would do just fine for the true lazy vacationer.Old hotel that's been updated, but furnishing are still pretty dated and bathtub needs caulking and has black gouges in the enamel. Excellent, friendly service. Not the hotel's fault but there's construction right outside our window that starts at 7:30 am each morning and ends at 5. Giant drills, cranes and machinery breaking up concrete parking lot. Non stop noise that shakes the room and the entire end of the hotel. Avoid room 121, 120 , 220 etc for sure. Not sure how to avoid this. Construction we are told will last week or longer. Go somewhere else if you want some quiet or to sleep past 7:30 am.Yup, pricey hotel.  For the cost, the room and bathroom were just ok.  I've stayed in nicer, but I've certainly stayed in worse... and we saw no signs of bugs or anything dirty in our room.  The beds were comfortable, the pull out couch was fine, the pillows were nice... it was certainly sufficient.  The common areas were also nice, the fountain in the middle is classy for sure.But its the location that likely drives up the price- it's next to a beautiful park that has a huge farmers market on Saturday mornings, plus it's behind a bustling part of King Street, so you are literally steps away from some of the best shopping in Charleston.  Besides the location, there are two really delightful things about this hotel that make it stand out for me:1. Happy Hour.  Every night from 5:30pm-7:30pm, there's a free happy hour at the hotel.  They put out light refreshments, usually veggies and ranch dressing, and then a rotating selection of cheese and crackers, freshly made sweet potato chips, etc.  But the stand out is the bar.  It's a real, fully stocked bar.  And the drinks are good, strong drinks.  We made dinner reservations every evening for 8:30pm, so we could enjoy happy hour out on the patio, and then get dressed and head out for the night... it was the ultimate pre-party.2. Breakfast Buffet.  Every morning, they serve a full breakfast buffet for guests.  Made to order omlets, pancakes, sausage and bacon and fruit and cereal and pastries and  yogurt and grits and coffee and juice... everything you could possibly think of for breakfast.  This breakfast was worth paying for, but in fact was free each morning.I would stay here again in a heartbeat.We came to Charleston for a long weekend. Finding a good place close to downtown without being too expensive was important. We thought a historic building remade into a hotel would be cute. When we first entered the hotel, it appeared a little small but open and charming.  While the lobby was nice, the bedroom was small and the carpet really old. And the food was really just this side of bad mediocre. While the staff was nice, I can't give this place more than three stars.Beautiful hotel with an extraordinary entrance including exotic birds in a cage in the lobby. Like all embassy suites there is complimentary breakfast which is quite good with eggs made to order as well as a complimentary happy hour from 5:30-7:30 pm with light snacks. Not mentioned on the hotel website is that there is a hot tub in addition to the pool. I was also interested to learn that the hotel was once the old city citadel and you can see remnants inside the suites if you look closely. If it's to steamy to travel to the market during the day there is usually someone selling baskets in the lobby in the evening or you can always use Charlestons rickshaw service who can usually make it there before an Uber and is also less expensive. It would have been a perfect stay except for the construction that stared at 7am! We were on the top floor and it was incredibly noisy and actual shook our bed.2.5 StarsTo be fair, I have to note that I used points during my stay because rates were ridiculous high during the week of my stay.Pros:+ Location- You are within walking distance of tons of restaurants and shops as well within a block of a stop for the free trolley. + Suites- They did offer separate living/working/sleeping spaces+ Room amenities-  They did have a microwave and small fridge+ Lobby- Nice and comfortable couch and chairs to lounge+ Free cooked-to-order breakfast and a nightly happy hour with snacks (if you can eat the food)Cons:- This place is old and the rooms need a make over. It looks like they did work on the bathroom and counter top with sink and holds the fridge and microwave, but forgot about the rest of the room. - The furniture was dated and stained- A/C - it didn't seem to work correctly. It wouldn't cool the rooms with the beds without having the door that separated it and the living spaceOur first hour in Charleston led us straight here. Thanks yelpers.  The fried chicken biscuit is insane.  Get it. Just do it. And get it the way they serve it, at least the first the. Its assumed that the chicken and the biscuit would be top notch, and they were.  The real surprise is the pairing with the pickle and siracha mayo.  The pickle is wonderfully tangy while the spice of the siracha adds another layer of flavor and the creaminess of the mayo ties everything together. Super good.Not your typical Embassy Suites.  Very historical looking.  They brought us waters and popcorn mid day and later cake.  Really nice &amp; goes to show the southern hospitality I'm always hearing about.The rooms were clean and spacious.  Free wifi and plenty of cable channels.  Had a suite so bedroom was separate.  They serve breakfast every morning and omelette made to order which are tasty -- made with real eggs vs. carton eggs.  In the early evening they serve complimentary wine and snacks.  Had a few nibbles while waiting for our cab before dinner.We went to lunch and walked around to explore the town some upon arrival... it started pouring rain on our way back... when we returned to the hotel there were fresh towels waiting in the lobby for us to use to dry off with.  Another nice well thought out perk!I found people who worked in service were over the top exemplary, but the Southern guests or people in general were rude and obnoxious.  One woman couldn't open the door from the patio to the breakfast area... I watched the whole incident where she walked around and started to yell at one of the staff.  He asked if she tried the other door and she was offended and said ""I'm not that ignorant"", which she was because she didn't try the other door!  Anyway, the hotel may want to consider putting a sign up on that other door.  I hate seeing innocent working people getting chewed out for issues that are not their fault.We booked our stay here because of the great location. The common space is very pretty. The room we have is very outdated and dirty. The hvac vents are dirty and gross. The walls have dust clinging to them. The carpet has been patched. The rooms look tried and worn out. The web site shows big bathrooms with garden tubs and our ours is very small with a very small tub/shower combo. The desk has no light on the desk or on the wall, so it very dark. The bedroom area is very small. The front desk staff/concierge service has been less than helpful. They did not have much information on events that were going on right next door to the hotel. The breakfast staff and food has been good. I would not recommend this hotel to stay at. Very disappointing.Dead flies and live spider on the window sill?Great location but room was dirty.  I put out our dishes from room service before we went to our 8pm show...and they were still there when we left our room for breakfast at 9am the next morning. Perhaps they didn't see it? Oh wait! We were nextdoor to the staff only facility door, and I actually saw the housekeeping trolley waiting outside my room yet they failed to pick up the tray. Mildew in the bathroom, peeling paint on the walls and insects (live and dead) in the window. No coffee table and no bedside table. Had to request my room to be cleaned twice in 12hours because it was not done.Breakfast was good with healthy and not healthy options.  Nice historic building but could use some tlc.Staff was friendly,  but need more training.Would not stay again.","**1.5 Stars**Booked a room here for Thursday (8/7) and Friday (8/8) of this week - a suite with 2 double beds.  The place certainly was NOT inexpensive - $229 for Thursday night, $379 for Friday night, plus another $82 for taxes - adding up to nearly $700 for a two night stay.  Spoiler alert: we only ended up staying one of the two nights...As noted by other reviewers, the hotel felt pretty dated.  This was somewhat offset by the historical significance of the building, being housed within the ""Old Citadel,"" which was actually pretty neat.The room itself was spacious, but again, felt very dated and was quite dark as the only windows were those looking out to the main interior of the hotel (i.e. no natural light) and having those curtains open meant forgoing any sort of privacy, as anyone walking down the hallway would be able to see directly into your room.The living room area and bathroom were both fine, but the bedroom layout was a bit awkward as the furniture was all off centered, leaving a large open space with nothing to fill it.  Bedding left much to be desired and was super uncomfortable. The mattress springs could easily be felt pressing into the side of your body and oddly there were no standard size pillows, only small square ones like those you would find on a couch.  Sadly, the pull out couch proved to be more comfortable than the actual beds.Aside from the lackluster room conditions:The hotel was LOUD with kids sprinting around the halls until 10:30PM.  With the rooms all situated around one large common area everything going outside of the rooms is amplified.The bedding was also ITCHY!  We didn't see any signs of bed bugs, but when we spoke to the person at the front desk they informed us that they had received complaints of bed bugs, ants, roaches, and fleas - so, it was quite possible that something was biting us.Needless to say, we checked out after the first night and found a different hotel!The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the fresh cookies at check-in were delicious - but unfortunately that does not make up for the expensive, uncomfortable, and itchy hotel stay.We won't be back.We got in mid-afternoon and were told our room wasn't ready because we'd requested no air freshener or perfume sprayed in it. Told us to come back in 30 minutes. Got back in an hour, spoke to a new clerk. Room not ready, she wasn't very patient and finally told us to go sit somewhere and not stand there. (!) We waited and waited, there was a coffee setup in the lobby but the coffee was cold. We asked the concierge for some hot and after an hour finally gave up. Even with a big urn it doesn't take an hour to make coffee. We timed it, it was over an hour and a half. They were baking cookies to go with said coffee, but no coffee and nobody had bothered to check. Pitiful. Got to our room eventually, after a two-hour wait from when we first arrived. It was on the far end of the hotel, and it stunk of air freshener so much that we could taste it. We propped the door open with a chair to air it out but that didn't do much, so we called and complained. We did use the coffee maker, there was still no coffee in the lobby and we were tired and out of sorts by then. About a half hour later the night housekeeping supervisor called very apologetic, her boss had gotten the message but instead of dealing with it passed it to her and left for the day. She apologized and said she didn't know how that could happen etc. By then we were so unhappy we insisted on speaking to a manager. Some time later the Guest Services Manager came by and said he had a couple of other rooms we could look at. The first one we were shown was not perfumey in the least, why we couldn't have had it to begin with is anybody's guess. He apollogized but had no answers (and didn't seem to care that we'd gotten such a runaround). The room was older. There was a small window next to the bed, up high, and it leaked icy air all night. The carpet had stains. The tile in the shower could have stood a good scrubbing. Given all these deficiencies, we were highly amused when the guest manager said we would get turndown service, consisiting of two bottles of water and a snack (pretzels or chocolate) at 5:30 because we are Hhonors Silver members. Most hotels, the water is in the room. Some time later closer to 6 there was a knock at the door and the maid handed us to bottles of wter and one fun-size Hershey bar like you give out at Halloween. We declined it. It's like they're trying to be grand and haven't got a clue. Next morning we packed up and had breakfast, it was OK. The grits were excellent but the rest was just so-so. The cheap pastries were tired and had no taste, no donuts (they had bagels) and the bread for toast was airloaf. The orange juice had about twice as much water in it as it should have. I imagine the omelets would have been better than the premade eggs but at that point we just wanted to eat and leave. We won't go back. For what they charged plus $20+ for valet parking) we should have had a much better room, meal, and service. One positive note: The concierge was helpful, he directed us to a soul food restaurant around the corner where we had supper. That was the high spot of this visit.Having stayed in a number of Embassy Suites over the years, including several in the last year, I've come to expect a great hotel experience. This specific hotel is known for the fact that it is the renovated Citadel but the accolades stop there. The decorations are not as grand as the other locations throughout the lobby or in the rooms, the rooms are small and the furniture is old. The first night that I pulled out the sofa bed I nearly thought that I was going to fall through the mattress because of the huge dent in it and the air conditioner only blew cold air. The staff thankfully was quite responsive and our thermostat was promptly repaired.Like all Embassy Suites, they had a hot breakfast and I must say that the egg white omelets that they served up were better than others that I've had. The Krispy Kreme doughnuts were a nice addition to their breakfast selection. We didn't rush back to make it to the happy hour so I can't comment on that experience.As other reviewers have mentioned, the location was excellent. Next door in the park was the farmers market, the visitor's center was down the street, King's street was a block away and a nice selection of restaurants and bars were within walking distance. Hopefully in the near future more can be said of this place beyond the fact that it is the former Citadel because right now, the hotel is just that - historical. I think that overall, the hotel was decent and for the discount that we got, it was well worth it but this location struck me as being one of the neglected hotels in the chain.Everything about this place is amazing! The spacious rooms, the free happy hour with snacks, they even put a complimentary makeup remover wipe in the bathroom. That to me, is genius! It came in handy and I was impressed! The bathroom is huge and super clean! It looked like it was scrubbed down and really is very pristine! The only reason not 4 stars is the parking is expensive and not connected to the hotel, it is charleston so I understand but a perfect hotel would have free parking. Also there was no fan in the bedroom and I have trouble without sleeping with one bc I need the white noise. Other than that. This place is DIVINE!Let me start off by saying the staff at the hotel were great.  However, we had to change rooms twice upon arrival because of a water leak and then a room that was much less than the one we booked.  Upon moving into our third room we discovered that it too had a water leak that had been very recently repaired because the carpet was still wet!  Our first morning there, Sunday, there was a church service being held in the park next door.  Unfortunately the band was right outside the wall playing at rock concert volume making it impossible to sleep past 8 am and shaking the walls.  Every morning past that we were again awakened at 8 am by the construction outside (hydraulically driving pylons into the ground) which could be heard everywhere in the city and shook the floor throughout the hotel.  Thankfully the manager at the front desk comped our parking for the week.  We would like to think that for over $200/night parking might be included instead of the $20/day we would have been charged!  Upon checkout we didn't receive a bill under the door as you normally would.  We checked at the front desk before we left for an itemized bill.  Good thing we did because my credit card was about to be charged an extra $325 over what I had booked the room for.  The staff was very helpful but there's no way we will be staying there on return visits.From the outside, the silhouette of an old fort/castle (formerly the Citadel) is amazing and inviting....once you walk inside, the hotel itself is not as cozy nor inviting as other Embassy Suites.    The atrium is basic and bare....the first day we walked by the atrium on our way to breakfast we saw someone sleeping on one of the couches....this person seemed like a homeless guy, not a patron of the hotel... that was a big turnoff.   Location is on the north end of the Historic District, which makes it a bit of a walk to the Battery and the City Market...The breakfast is the basic Embassy suites fare, but the fruit was bland (cantaloupe and melons tasted like nothing)...Breakfast area is very small and even though they let guests sit in other areas, it is not very convenient.  Room was again...basic.    It felt a bit dated.    Overall an OK Embassy Suites, if it wasn't for the exterior, I would have given it 2 stars...""Great location, beautiful building""The hotel is a beautiful Charleston historic landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Buildings. The place used to be Citadel Military College and is right next to Marion Square. The rooms are nicely furnished and some of their walls are the original ones, with exposed bricks and all! Rooms are clean, they offer free wifi, cable TV and nice amenities.A breakfast buffet is included in the nightly rate and there's even a chef making pancakes, omelets and eggs  to order. The evening Manager's reception offers complementary mixed drinks (really great margaritas), beer, wine and hors d'oeuvres. Every Embassy Suites has an atrium, but the one in Charleston is bright, spacious and with gorgeous flowers and plants that invite you to sit to relax for a while. The location is perfect: in the heart of historic downtown Charleston and walking distance from nice shops and restaurants on King, Market and Meeting streets.<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthebilingualtraveler.blogspot.com%2F&amp;s=19bfe74a0d23f418a3441931309ce8641dd171c95557a4b317b6a45afcd52d0d"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">thebilingualtraveler.blo...</a>Just spent 3days at the Hotel and room was spacious, staff was helpful, great breakfast. Location was close to everything and walking distance to shopping food and shopping.This hotel is above and beyond the average downtown hotel. The staff was very good. During the evening turn down service the staff left me wonderful chocolates and a nice note about the next day's weather. I haven't received this kind of customer service in a long time.Sabrina is the best. We would NOT of stayed here if it wasn't for her. She gives exceptional customer service, and should consider working for one of the more customer focused hotels. We were pleasantly surprised, because we didn't have much expectation for an embassy suite hotel. The room was fine, the pool was cool, location was amazing, but the other staff were not up to par. Sadly we will not come back.I stayed here for 2 out of 3 nights for buisness.  The hotel was the Citadel at one time from what the front desk told me although they had no pictures to prove the story.  The room was large and gave me more than enough room to relax and do my work.  The breakfast was free and it filled the tank for my day on the job.  Starting at 1730 they had drinks in the lobby and that was a good way to end a long day of work.  I really like this hotel after spending a night accross the street at the Hampton Inn.  I will stay here again when I return for work or pleasure.Hotel is an epic FAIL!! Very noisy from surrounding bars, and you can hear your neighbors since building construction is old and outdated. Rooms are blah, bathrooms have that dirty feel, and the staff from the bar served wine in lipstick stained glasses. If you can afford better, go to a different hotel.It's all good,,, I've stayed at several embassy suites. This one is cool because it used to be an old armory. The guest rooms are smaller than typical for embassy suites, but what they lack in size is made up for by the uniqueness of the property. It is an old building,,,, like the revolutionary war old!!! But again, it's very unique. I'll definitely stay here again.Our FAVORITE place to stay in Charleston. My fiancee proposed down in the battery while we were staying here. The staff was amazing!! He let them know what he was planning and while we were out, they placed roses, champagne and chocolates in our room. All complimentary! Outstanding customer service!! Also, we really enjoy their breakfast and welcome reception. Everyone we encountered was as pleasant and friendly as they could be. Can't wait to stay again this cStayed here for 2 nights while visiting Charleston for the first time. We thought it was closer to the heart of all the activities so we were a little disappointed with the location. We would recommend self park and not valet just because you probably will not need your car until you leave. Frank the concierge was not very friendly to me and that was disappointing. He had more of a do what I say or you might as well go home kind of philosophy and wasn't that forthcoming about the things I was interested in. The rest of the staff seemed friendly enough, but know that if you're having an omelet made to order it will take some time. They are not as quick as most Embassy Suites. I was impressed with the sweet potato chips and fresh veggies though that we had the first night during happy hour.Really nice place. The rooms are very large with a living room space and a bedroom. My room had two televisions and I really liked the granite counters for the dry bar area and bathroom. Complimentary breakfast in the morning was hot and tasty and they do customizable omelettes which were very good. There is also 2 complimentary beverages offered to guests at the hotel bar every night. Sweet. I forgot my tooth brush, tooth paste, and shaving cream at home and the concierge at the front gave me complimentary replacements, so that's great. I would have given it 5 stars but the fact that I only had one window in the entire suite was a small drawback. I guess that's the price you pay for repurposing a historic citadel buildingThe staff was great. When you valet your car they place three major newspapers in your car for the morning. Overall, I would say that it is the perfect balance between a corporate hotel and a historic building. It is owned by Hilton but there was minimal corporate signage and advertising which is nice when you're staying in the historical district.What's not to like!I am writing this from the hotel room, on our second and last night. My 2 year old son is asleep in a crib (provided by hotel) in the separate living room, and my husband and I can watch tv without disturbing the little one. A 2-room suite is a must when travelling with kids, and this was the only hotel I could find that had this, at that price, with this prime location. We walked everywhere from the hotel, they lent us an umbrella, had our room ready before the regular check-in time, provide a drink reception every night in the lobby, and free hot breakfast. The staff is super nice, the hotel is a historic building and looks amazing, I wouldn't think of going anywhere else if I ever come back, and will recommend this hotel.Stayed the weekend of 10/23 - 10/26.As a Diamond HHonors member, I prefer to stay at Hilton hotels, so as usual I booked this hotel. This was a tremendous stay for me, everyone from the bell-caps to housekeeping were outstanding. I drove my car and used the valet, I was able to call down for my car whenever I needed it. I didn't participate in the breakfast buffet or evening social as we were more interested in dining out at the many top choices in Charleston. We'll be staying here the next time we come to Charleston, its central location to almost everything and the proximity to High Street where many restaurants and clubs makes it an advantage. I have to add something, whenever I walked by the front desk I got a hello from both Rachel and Hanna, I found it odd that these two young ladies were working during each time I walked by the front desk from morning to evening, I found it nice that they were always pleasant regardless of how many hours they actually work.I checked in at 10:30 PM, so I didn't have a chance to enjoy the happy hour.  As a Hilton Honors Member, I was greeted with a welcome bag and water bottles. There was no bellman available, so I helped myself to the many luggage carts in the lobby.  When the bellman/valet appeared he offered to help.  At that point, I figured I was 85% there in loading my luggage.  So as a bellman not so great, but he was a helpful concierge.  He directed me to the 24 hour Walgreens across the park.  The park is a bit dark.  He claimed it was safe (that night it was).  Lily at the front desk was kind during my check in and gave helpful tips.  The rooms could use and update and a really good cleaning.  Luckily, I had a double bed room, or I would've enjoyed the DNA and hair of the prior room occupants in one of the beds.  The rooms are large, for a centrally located hotel, that is a plus.  My room was on the ""construction"" side of the hotel.  They don't start that early thankfully, bit I was greeted at 5:40 AM with the hum of machinery somewhere in very near vicinity. Staff was nice, but for the price and the room cleanliness/DNA issues, I give a solid, ""meh"".I've been here several times and I've finally heard the poops.  Haunted.  Yep, ghosts.  He even has a name, ""Half Head"".  The corner rooms, on the mezz, have had numerous complaints of a teenage boy with only half a head coming and visiting them in their rooms at night.  Apparently he's a friendly bloke, and not out just for mischief.  I think the true attraction is how close it is to King Street, where there are lots of restaurants and stores.  Walking distance.","Walk through to see the place, but keep on walking... Very cool that it is the old Citadel restored but other than that, stay somewhere else honestly.  The location is great but there are some other kick-butt hotels nearby for $200 a night...I've stayed at this hotel 3 separate times...and there's a reason. Dated. Super dated. If the location wasn't so great (right on Marion Square) and the staff not so nice, we'd be looking at 3 stars.  But honestly, for a few nights, it's a comfortable place, with traditionally spacious suites and a pool/gym downstairs.  Happy hour each evening for free drinks and light apps is a nice touch. Those who like a hotel breakfast will appreciate the nice free buffet downstairs. But again, don't say I didn't warn you.  The fixtures look like they're from the 90's, and the decor is terrible maroon/evergreen and in some places tacky floral.  Get out of the room, enjoy your time in Charleston!The location is great.  Albeit not too healthy, the breakfast in the morning is great and made to order.  And the staff was nice and knowledgeable.  Sorry folks I hate to write a negative review...BUT...I really didn't like the room, we didn't have a single window in our room.  It felt like a prison...I travel a ton for business and I am used to staying in similar hotels and this probably my least favorite ever.   They also had a bird in the lobby that you could hear all the way on the other side of the hotel with the door closed.  I am not sure whose idea it is to have a squawking bird in the lobby.  Also, the pictures i looked really do not represent the experience I had.Always a good stay here. We stay here when family is in town and we want to bar hop for the night. Can't beat the managers special (warm up for the night) and free breakfast in the morning. This hotel is dated but that adds to the historical charm. Definitely not your typical Embassy. Staff are very friendly and helpful.Stay here for 2 main reasons: convenience and space. You will get a spacious room and never need a car because you can walk everywhere. Start your day with a breakfast of omelettes cooked to order, and then you can spend your dining budget on the endless options of wonderful cuisine downtown for lunch and dinner. The hotel hosts a daily happy hour that serves mediocre wine (I'd recommend skipping it) and cheap beer, but it's free so one can't really complain. Visiting Charleston means eating a lot of great food. So when you are looking for the fitness center at this hotel, you could miss it if you blink. It's in the pool house building. I did not sense that it is used frequently judging by the dust and dirt on the otherwise decent cardio equipment and free weights. You're better off going for a run along Meeting street to the battery.Overall, it's a great hotel for the two reasons mentioned above. But for the price point, I'd expect it to be a little bit better.Great rooms with a historic touch. Managers reception, great breakfast. Walking distance to many of Charleston's best attractions and restraunts.Channel 70 crew arrived in the wee hours in a cold, pounding, rain after six hours in a bouncing rental van. The desk clerk had us checked in mere nano-seconds. Yes! A few hours later, we caught the very end of breakfast. The cook asked us if we wanted seconds as he was getting ready to close the line. Nice.The following morning, a garbage truck somewhere below my window substituted for the morning wake up call. Not fun. Also, the desk is sometimes slow to answer calls, but  not enough so to be a game changer.Overall, this ES is at the top of its form. (now, if they could  just get rid of early AM garbage trucks)Aesthetically, it is a beautiful hotel.  Room is really nice with a separate living room and a bedroom with an exposed brick wall.  Bed was comfortable.  However, the walls are PAPER THIN.  The wall in the bedroom...could totally hear conversations going on in the other room and last night...could totally hear the couple making love (headboard creaking and all)...ewwwwww.  And the doors to all rooms face into a noisy courtyard that makes it impossible to not hear kids screaming and running around in the halls early morning.  Impossible to sleep in.  You can also hear doors slamming.   The location is great and you are paying a premium for that location.  This is a renovated building (used to be part of the Citadel)...a recent one at that. Would have expected that they would have put a little more thought in the construction.Great staff! Excellent service and in a very great location. The price was affordable for our suite top notch service. Although check in was at 3pm, the Manager allowed us to check in at 10 am!!! Now that is service :) Highly recommended and while the pool wasn't the best and the food wasn't the best, who stays at their hotel at all when you are in Charleston???? Go explore some of the best restaurants in the nation !!!!!What a disappointing experience. My husband and I attended a wedding in Charleston and this hotel was listed as an option by the wedding party. The exterior and the front area if the hotel lead you to believe that you will have a 'Charlestonian'  experience but once you get past that it is a tired motel experience. Our sleeping room had a king bed crammed into a room that was not big enough for a Queen bed. There was only room for 1 bedside table. It smelled like a 'motel' and all of the accessories from the toiletries to the coffee were low-end. The only that wasn't low end was the $384 bill for 1 night. Charleston hotels are expensive but you should at least enjoy your accommodations--skip this option!Very nice place.  Stayed four nights - just the wife and I - and had an overall good experience.  Always love the suite so we each have a tv and a place for ""alone"" time.   Breakfast is, of course, included and was very good.  I had a made-to-order omelet 2 of 4 mornings.  Bacon they prepared was especially tasty.It's the old Citadel and the windows in the rooms (at least the one we were in) are not at eye level; not a real problem, still plenty of natural light in the bedroom.Service was generally very good although housekeeping only left us one bath towel one day but a call to the desk rectified this.Great location as long as you like to walk - which we do.  Had no problem walking to Battery etc.  Several nice restaurants a block or two away on Kent (the hotel is on Meeting).Definitely recommend.  Sadly this is the end of our New Orleans/Charleston vacation.4 stars for the staff but 2.5 for the hotel. The free breakfast was great, be sure to have them make you an omelet to order. The room was big but so weird with the windows 6-8 feet above ground. I had to climb up on the ledge to look out. I had small cockroaches in my bathroom each night and when I looked under the sink I understood why. There were big holes into the wall around the pipes. The place had some upgrades but still felt dated. My shower had more water still coming out of the faucet than the shower head but the staff did say they would work to fix it. Just an odd feeling to the place. It was in a great location. Walking distance to everything! So a very mixed review.Stayed here earlier this week for the third time.  The rooms get 1.5 stars - they really did a cheap job when renovating.  And the wireless is slowThe positives are a good location and nice staffPlus, if it's important to you, they have three types of microwavable meatloaf for sale in the pantry off the front desk...We stayed at this hotel because a block of rooms was reserved there for the wedding we were in town to attend. It's a very historic looking building with an inviting lobby and very friendly staff. The breakfast is top notch for this level of hotel. We enjoyed everything about our stay, except for the paper-thin walls between rooms. If our neighbors were having a conversation in the bedroom, we could hear every single word. This wasn't the case in the living room, probably because the sound of the fountain in the courtyard helped drown it out, but it's odd to hear someone next door so clearly it's as if they're in the room with you. The hotel is in a great location to local attractions, and all things considered, we'd likely stay here again.This hotel is really great. It's not fancy, but it's clean, economical &amp; well run. The free (cooked to order) breakfast &amp; free drinks &amp; appetizers at 5:30 is a huge savings for a vacation or business trip. It is located well, especially since North King street is up &amp; coming &amp; really close.  We didn't actually discover it until our last night, but still enjoyed all the hip new clubs.  No disappointments here at all!Very good hotel choice if staying downtown. Big rooms/suites, excellent service, and daily happy hour. Walking to King Street is easy, and close to some good restaurants and bars. This is my choice when possible. Stayed several times, never had bad experience.Although pricey, as even with my corporate discount it was $179/nite, plus $18/day to park, this is a fine hotel. Rooms are very clean and spacious. Hotel has a nice open, airy feel to it. Staff is helpful and friendly. Hotel is located in a great spot to where you can walk to the tourist hot spots. This used to be an old fort, and my room still had a gun port in it. Cool.You do get free breakfast which is pretty robust.They will even cook an omelette to order for you. There's also a happy hour around 5:30 each night where you get free drinks and snacks.The hotel and rooms are very clean. The staff is prompt and friendly. The hotel is walking a short walking distance to King street and a little longer to market street. Perfect place to stay while being a charleston tourist.Refer to Daniel C review on 3/11. Staff A++location AInside/outside seating AAmenities (happy hour,food,breakfast)-AShower BCouches in room (mystery stains) D+Overall wonderful experienceOur family stayed here for 3 nights.  Great location for walking to get food and seeing the sights.  The rooms are nice and clean.  Staff was very nice.  The breakfast in the mornings was good.  Something for everyone.  Make sure to try the made to order omelet bar.  Evening drinks and snacks were good.  The pool is ok, I saw a mouse climb up the wall while I was watching the kids play in the pool.  The gym is small but has 2 treadmills and some other type of machine and plenty of free weights.  All in all I enjoyed this hotel.","Clean, helpful and courteous staff, comfortable, great amenities, good breakfast, free drinks 5-7PM, and they accommodate smokers. Their food isn't bad for hotel food, but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here with so much other excellent dining in the area.so much better in pictures! I love the fact that this is a converted space and wasn't torn down to make room for some generic thing, but I thought the hotel was kind of creepy. The rooms are as said, very basic, not horrible but not all that great either. Not all that big. The beds are very comfortable, and a few other nice things - breakfast included and there is an evening happy hour thing also included. Location is pretty good, you're near upper king and Marion Square.Ok, let me start by saying that in the last three years I have spent more nights in a Hilton property than my own home, not necessarily a reccommended accomplishment, but it does give me a good frame of reference. Great interior.  It is actually the original Citadel. Very friendly and attentive staff. The rooms are older but have been remodeld and nicely updated.  There is a nightly manager's special with complementary drinks and a great free breakfast.  The only issue I had was that the work out facility was sub par to some of the other Embassy's I've visited.  Not bad,but almost as an after thought.  It's kinda of hidden in a room off the pool.  If I could have rated it 4 1/2 stars, I would have.  Nice place to stay!Very solid hotel.  The rooms are basic and dont have attention to detail (i.e. none of the clocks are set right or to each other).  But they are large, have a kitchenette, great TVs, comfortable beds and nice coffee service.  The hotel is in a great spot.  We will stay here again.The staff was very friendly and helpful. The happy hour was a nice bonus. The first room wasn't wonderful. It felt very humid/wet and had an odd smell but we assumed it was because it was hot out and maybe some smells were from the  market. Yes, it was weird that the floor was damp... And then it rained terribly one night... The ceiling started leaking and water dripped onto the carpet and one of the chairs. It started slow then really picked up. We had our answer. This was, obviously, not the first occurrence. They did switch our room for the last night with no issue but never offered anything to make up for the inconvenience. The new room felt better. The style of the building was neat as it is the old Citadel. The breakfast was great and the omlet chef was very nice. Make sure you buy your own bottled soft drinks as they were 2.50 in the hotel concession area. Very close to the main shopping areas of King Street. Short walk to the outdoor market. The Saturday market sets up along the side of the hotel and is full of awesome vendors.This Embassy Suites is one of the best that I have stayed at; friendly employees, clean rooms, a wonderful breakfast, and in walking distance from historic Charleston.  Even the parking attendant talked to us about our trip and how we were doing, as well as the bellboy who did the same, telling us about the time he and a friend hitchhiked to San Francisco and lived in the Haite Ash berry and saw all of the hippie actions and things that happen in that neighborhood.  The building was an old citadel and has hard wood floors in the lobby, plus some of the old architecture throughout the hotel.  Breakfast was pretty good with fresh orange juice, fluffy pancakes, and tender sausage and tender, crispy bacon.  I did not go down for happy hour, but it sounded good.  So, for a clean hotel, particularly one of the cleanest Embassy Suites with a friendly staff to mach, the Embassy Suites Historic Charleston cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!",,"['place', 'really', 'nice', 'serve', 'breakfast', 'complimentary', 'afternoon', 'happy', 'hour', 'drinks', 'coffee', 'time', 'atrium', 'area', 'pretty', 'rooms',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-roof-plus-mount-pleasant,Red Roof PLUS+,3.0,$$,20,"I'm in their bed right now! Ohh... risque!It's a Red Roof Inn... so the rooms face outside. If you can get over that... and realize you're paying less than $100 for a hotel room near Charleston then you'll be okay.The building is older... but that's about it. This hotel is branded as a Red Roof PLUS+ (plus plus!). Nearly everything has been refreshed. The rooms have wood-like floors, modern cabinetry, lots of charging plugs near the bed, and even one of those fancy vessel sinks. The TV is a brand-name HD screen with ALL HD channels... which is nice for a hotel of this quality (2-star). There is free WiFi throughout but don't expect it to be super-duper high speed. At 9:30pm it's only .52 Mbps UP/ .26 Mbps DOWN. Yes.. POINT 52. But hey, free is free. Overall, compared with staying in downtown Charleston... this place is nice, cheap, and less than a 10 minute drive across the big bridge. Bottom line: Give it a shot! It's better than a normal Red Roof!Website says they have free breakfast. They do not even offer grab and go or ANY breakfast.. They advertise this as a ""plus"" property but it has no better amenities than any of the $49 a night red roof inns across the country. In fact they charge extra for a fridge and microwave in the room here...I am trying figure out exactly what the Plus in Red Roof Inn Plus is for.Is the Plus for the clothes that was left in the drawers from the prior guest that the cleaning staff did not find?  Or is the Plus for the group of Walmart remodelers who start drinking beer at 7 am and grill out in the parking lot just below our room  that the front counter person approves of?  Or could it be for the domestic that was taking place in the room next to ours?  Or maybe it stands for the internet connection that did not work and the hotel staff that seemed unconcerned?Not really sure what the Plus is for?!Over all the rooms we recently remodeled and looked very nice and the hotel is located in a very convenient location. Don't ask for a refund for your bad experience because the counter girl will just tell you it was not their fault.Safe travels!Decent place to lay head for the night for an economy hotel. Clean. Pool small but nice for a dip to cool off. No complaints.We were impressed with the appearance and the upgrades they've done to the rooms. The bathroom was HUGE! however our room didn't have an iron, and they do not provide maid service on day 2. (No fresh towels, bed was not made). It is in a great location to downtown Charleston and all the attractions.It's a basic hotel but it was comfortable.  The bathroom is a tad bit small &amp; there were black marks on the ceiling that probably should be cleaned but overall it was what decent.This is the second Red Roof Inn I have ever visited and I was not disappointed. My wife and I arrived way before check in time (4:30 am) and the guy at front desk said he would help us out and have a room ready in an hour for no extra charge. He gave us some info about local 24 hour places to grab some early breakfast and then gave us a map of Charleston. The room was great and had everything we needed for a quick overnight visit. Everything was very clean and the shower was a good size. We needed a razor and an iron which they had in the lobby for no extra charge. The location was great as we were right off the Mt. Pleasant entrance to the bridge into Charleston (which means we were only like 10-15 min to anything in downtown Charleston). In addition, there are a few restaurants and shopping centers right around the hotel. We would definitely stay here again.1st night: so far so good. Quick check in, friendly staff, and choice of lower level room. The room was really clean, hardwood floors (yay!), and overall very clean. Bathroom is a little small, but not a deal breaker. Plenty of hangers, and a small safe, if you need it. FREE WI-FI, which is a definite plus. Overall, pleasantly surprised.Very dog friendly which was the main reason for booking, a little disappointed they did not have simple breakfast in the morning.  The rooms were clean and the location was great. Very close to the downtown Charleston atmosphere.Not sure what the new PLUS is for. We stayed here a couple of years ago, and were very happy with the location and the convenience of the hotel. So, when we were returning to Charleston for a couple of days, we immediately booked with Red Roof Inn. We were ahead of schedule, so a few hours before arrival, we called to see if we could check in early. We were surprised to be told that the ground floor room we had requested (I have bad knees), SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, MIGHT be available, if the people currently in it checked out. If they decided to stay, our RESERVED room would not be available, but we could have a second floor room...no elevator. Fortunately, we were able to get the ground floor room,,,the one we RESERVED WEEKS ago! The hotel is very convenient to several shops and restaurants, and provides easy access to Charleston. However, the PLUS isn't clear. I could never get my tablet to connect to wifi, although my husband had no trouble connecting his laptop. I assumed it was a glitch with my tablet, but when we checked into the LaQuinta in Savannah, it connected immediately. There is no coffee maker in room, no breakfast, no ironing board or iron, all of which are included in competitors' rooms, often at a lower price.Those things are not a deal breaker, but not being assured of a reserved room in a busy city like Charleston is absolutely unacceptable.Last winter looking for a break from a frigid and snowy northern VA winter last March, I was looking for an affordable and dog friendly hotel in Mount Pleasant, SC near Sullivan's Island. (My favorite vacation spot). This RRI was a perfect match.  No more than a 10 minute drive from the ocean (SI), its location was perfect. It is close to all a vacationer would want: Whole Foods, Starbucks, drug stores, pizzaria, and more. Mt. P is a charming little town.  The RRI staff was efficient and friendly and the room was comfortable with HD flat screen, clean, good shower water pressure, fast wifi.  FYI most of the rooms facing the pond do not have microwaves and mini fridges.  This was a challenge to eat healthy as most of my dinners were take out. Next time I will book early to secure a prime room. Speaking of the pond, it is beautiful with a spacious attractive bench overlooking it. A couple of mornings I had my coffee there and the budding spring weather and tranquil water was a great start to my day.  One negative is the cigarette butts on the ground below the bench.  The staff works to remove them, but can't keep up with the daily influx of lazy inconsiderate smokers. My dog loves the water, but I was advised by the lady who checked us in to beware of the pond due to a recent alligator sighting !!!  When I return to Mount Pleasant my dog and I will eagerly return to this Red Roof Inn.For a Red Roof Inn, I was quite pleased. The front desk clerk (I didn't catch her name) was sweet and very helpful.When we arrived to Charleston after a 6 hour drive, I logged onto Expedia and started looking for hotels. This place came up and I'm glad it did. Certainly the most affordable hotel I could find on the strip. We got the deluxe room for only $10 more from a standard room. Pet allowance was a deal breaker for me because I had my puppy with me and there was no extra charge for pets. The rooms were very clean, comfy beds, and a fridge/microwave which is always nice.Tip: the even numbered rooms are facing the main road in Mt. Pleasant and all of the odd numbered roads are on the other side of the hotel, overlooking a pond. I like the hustle and bustle and lights so I'm glad we were given an even numbered room. Would I return? Absolutely.Recently refurbished! Beautiful, smoke free, comfortable room. Flat screen TV, Wifi, super easy online booking and a really great price. Very satisfied.I paid for a deluxe room and NO coffee maker?!!! Microwave and refrigerator but no coffee maker seems ridiculous and the room with one would cost me $10 more a day. I will never stay here again.I was very iffy about this place at first but after looking around the area for a hotel and prices it was very affordable. This is a newly all renovated place and is really nice. The staff was really friendly and helpful and I would definitely come back! Only down fall is you will hear noise from out side with other people walking past and talking but everything else was great. I would recommend this red roof especially for the price. If you don't want to spend all your vacation money on a hotel I would say stay here. It's the perfect location for everything. Your near all the restaurant's and shopping and your around the corner from the bridge to take you into downtown Charleston. It only takes like 10 minutes from hotel can't beat it at all!!!!!I had no problem with this hotel. However, I should say that it is a Red Roof, not the Waldorf Astoria or Ritz Carlton. If you want a 5 star Pamper the customer to no end hotel, then get one. That said, my room was clean, the front desk clerk (Becky was on duty when I checked in) was fantastic, being friendly, efficient, and helpful.My room was clean, everything worked, etc. In other words, it was a clean place to store my stuff, shower, and sleep. If you have a choice, I'd recommend getting an Odd Numbered room, as they are in the back of the hotel, overlook a pond, and are away from the main road. The location is good, right off Route 17 near Patriots Point, and there are a couple of small shopping centers nearby. It is also about 5 minutes from Downtown Charleston, so the city is accessible without paying city prices...The bed and pillows were quite comfortable to me. The only drawbacks were a small, but functional bathroom, and no continental breakfast, but those aren't dealbreakers for me. I would stay there again if I'm in the area.It's a Red Roof Inn so it can only top out with three stars. However, it's a great bargain in Mt P. Great location.First room covered in dog hair second room had bed bugs. staff super friendly but you can't polish a turd:(Just avoid this hotel, it needs too much work to save the money you would by staying here with bed bugs.What a shit hole! When we reserved our room they told us that there were coffee pots in the rooms, micro waves, refrigerators and no bed bugs.  they were wrong on all counts.  Of course the worst were the bed bugs.  We had to leave and find a different hotel.  They denied that that they had bed bugs and would not refund our money.  Maybe it was my fault, after all what do you expect for $ 100""per night. Any where else but  the Red Rash Inn.I had gone to Priceline to book my hotel, and this was what was chosen for me. I was a little iffy since I had heard Red Roof Inns aren't great, but this place was decent. Maybe I'm used to hotels, and didn't pack a hair dryer because I assumed it would be in the room - nope! But the room was clean, small, I got to check in a couple of hours early and the front desk attendant was very nice and accommodating. Even when I went to check out, I needed to check into my flight, and the woman at the front desk let me use one of the computers. It was in October, so an off-season in SC, and the gate was locked around the pool. I asked if the gate could be unlocked just so I could lay out, and they had no problem doing that! The walls were kind of thin, there was a dog in the room next door and kept whimpering all throughout the night when no one was in the room. I would have liked to stay on the beach or in downtown Charleston, but overall this place was good for someone just using it to put their things down and sleep.",,,,,"['bed', 'right', 'red', 'roof',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/harbourview-inn-charleston,Harbourview Inn,4.5,$$$,39,"I went to Charleston on a weekend girl's trip and we stayed at Harborview Inn. This hotel is in a great location, the staff is superb and ultra-friendly, the perks are the icing on the cake. The size of the rooms ( and bathrooms) were phenomenal. The futniture, fixtures, and hardware were a breath of fresh air because it added to the charm of the city....felt like someone put thought into the senses of and with the customer in mind.There was enough counter space which was surprising.My room was near the atrium, unlimited coffee, tea, hot chocolate (with marshmallows). They also served wine and cheese on a daily basis. The main lobby felt like home. Great view, wood burning fireplace, and an open business area. We arranged a travelzoo deal which included a daily breakfast. Delivery and variety did not disappoint.The location was great. Next to shops, snacks, restuarants, bars...all walking distance!I'd definitely stay here again...and again.My girlfriend and I were heading to Charleston from Savannah right after all the flooding from hurricane Joaquin, we were debating on if we would make the drive because of all the road closures..We arrived downtown without a place to stay, so we drove around looking for nice parts of town, since neither of us had even been to Charleston.. We were down by the water and came across the harborview inn. The hotel was classy looking and appeared to be super expensive, we were sure it was out of our budget. After googling some amazing reviews we figured we would call, just for the heck of it.. We spoke to a very nice gentleman named MIKE.. We asked if they had a room available, and they said they did. The price was less then expected, but still out of our price range.. After explaining to him our situation and price range he put us on hold and came back with a rate we felt we couldn't refuse.. Wow are we glad we did..After entering the lobby we knew we made a good call. We introduced ourselves to MIKE and gave him all our info for check-in. MIKE said that our room wouldn't be ready for awhile, but maybe he could find a room that was ready. Well he upgraded is to this amazing room that blew is away.. Can't say enough about Mike and Jack.. Jack is the bellhop and valet.. Thanks guys for making our stay amazing !!For being a local, I don't get the opportunity to stay in hotels often, but when downtown flooded and I had a work obligation for the weekend, I found refuge in this lovely little hotel. Small enough to feel boutique, but large enough for some killer amenities. You can't beat the late check out, breakfast, complimentary wifi and great view! I'm well traveled and have stayed in some of the best hotels in larger cities, and this room is up with the top! The bed may be the most comfortable I've ever slept in a hotel, and that shower- heavenly. I'll be recommending this to anyone I know staying in the area, it's well worth the price!5 stars for us! We were spoiled with having a room close to the front desk so we were just steps from the wine &amp; cheese in the evening, the cookies &amp; milk at night, and the cozy fireplace with the pretty view of the harbor. Not to mention our balcony view of the harbor! Very cute! Would definitely recommend this little gem on the harbor :-)Location cannot be beaten. Right in the midst of the French Quarter with all that is Charlestown at your feet. An assortment of continental style breakfasts are include with your accommodations as well as Happy Hour wines and cheeses. The service at these ""included"" amenities are lack luster. The woman pouring the wine at Happy Hour was pouring as she was looking down at her phone and either texting or reading texts. The room service server was in such a hurry to drop the breakfast tray and run that she missed out on the cash tip we were going to give her. Rooms comfortable and the beds snuggly. We would return to the Inn on our next visit.I had a work emergency arise and had to cancel my reservation 48 hours in advance of my scheduled arrival.  The immediate response was to bill me immediately for (1) night, which I find utterly ridiculous.  Life happens, emergencies happen, and most certainly work emergencies happen.  They should be flexible and instead they choose not.Oh well, regardless of its great location I will continue to visit Charleston and using other properties.Perfect.  Amazing location, great rooftop terrace, extremely comfortable bed, really nice shower and bathroom.The price was a little much for someone who doesn't make a ton of money.  But wow, there is nothing bad to write about this place.  They do wine and cheese from 5-6pm (free) daily.  Cookies and milk from 9pm+ (free), and breakfast delivered to your request (as long as you fill out the paperwork).  Coffee and tea (frees) always out in the atrium, as well as fruit (apples, bananas, oranges).  Not to mention the staff was extremely nice, well, except the girl who delivered the food for breakfast, i don't know what it was, but it stuck out really poorly mostly because all the other staff was so friendly from the front desk, to the bellboys, to the girls who help with the wine and cheese.Don't even consider staying somewhere else, stay here.The perfect spot to stay when you're in Charleston! I was in town recently for a girls weekend and can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel.   From the time I made our reservations by phone to our check out, we had an extremely positive experience.The hotel is in prime location literally across the street from Charleston Waterfront Park and minutes from the Water Taxi. Everything is within walking distance so there is no need to rent a car or drive. We had a room with 2  comfy queen beds which were comparable to what you'd see in a Westin or W. The room was very spacious as well as the bathroom. There was also wait staff that would come to our room every day to do ""turn down service"" which I am not used to and seemed a little funny to me. The coolest part was the complimentary breakfast that was delivered to our room. We had to fill out a breakfast card of what we would like to eat and hang it on our doorknob the night before with our desired breakfast delivery time. Like clockwork, our meals were delivered to our room. Make sure to tip!They also offer complimentary cookies and milk from 9p-10p every night as well as complimentary fruit, coffee and tea downstairs in the lobby. We were out late a few nights and for security measures, you need your hotel card to even enter the hotel which I liked. Don't think I will stay anywhere else the next time I am in town. This place is one that I would highly recommend. It is a little pricey but is worth the cost when it comes to the perks and location.Stayed here for 6 days in February. Booked the romance package, which came with Valet parking, private carriage tour of Charleston, champagne in the room, breakfast in bed daily, red roses upon arrival, and a $100 gift certificate for the High Cotton restaurant. The location of this hotel is convenient, right by numerous restaurant and bars and close to the King street shopping area. It's in a beautiful neighborhood with plenty to do and plenty historic buildings. The service was good, but they forgot the champagne. The hotel does not have a working kitchen for hot food, so room service is not an option and the breakfast in bed meant continental cold foods only, but they did offer tea and coffee. But it never bothered us, as Charleston offers a wide array of good quality restaurants nearbyGreat bed, breakfast and wine and cheese hour. Super location with views of harbor and great access to restaurants and historic district. First class staff with spacious room and amenities. Would recommend and return.  Valet parking on premise.Really excellent stay.   Great breakfasts and amazing service.  One night we did not get turn down service, but that was literally my only complaint!  They could change up the afternoon snacks a bit (jelly beans, etc). The chocolate got melty in the hot weather when we would walk out with it. Would absolutely stay here again the next time I'm in town. I felt like it compared to a nice ritz carlton.As a result of researching hotels for a Charleston trip for my wife and me, we picked the HarbourView Inn because of its amenities and location in the French Quarter on the Charleston harbor waterfront.We were given a water-view room that was very well appointed, sufficiently spacious, and extremely quiet, comfortable, and clean.  Our amenities included complimentary afternoon wine and cheese in the atrium.  The continental breakfast was inclusive and delivery options included our room, the atrium, or the hotel's rooftop.  We chose the rooftop because of the nice views and the fine weather.  We breakfasted at the hotel three mornings and were wholly satisfied with the quality and variety that included yogurt, parfaits, fruit, cereal, and baked goods plus drinks.Our service was excellent.  All of the members of the staff, including the parking valets, were very courteous and helpful.  In particular, our receptionist/concierge Jessica was a standout.  In addition to being very gracious, she provided us with numerous excellent dinner recommendations and called to make reservations for us. The location of this hotel could not have been better.  It is in close proximity to the historic residential district, topnotch restaurants, the Market area, and other city attractions.  The free DASH city trolley bus stops across the hotel's front door and will take you to many attractions outside of walking distance.The HarbourView Inn is a first-rate hotel in an ideal location and staffed with very accommodating and professional personnel.We stayed at The Habourview Inn for four days/three nights while visiting Charleston.Overall, the experience was definitely nice and pleasant. Here are some of the positives:-Friendly staff for the most part (everyone was helpful and meant well)-Nice rooms with large, remodeled bathrooms -Cool common areas (a large atrium, front desk sitting area, and rooftop patio)-Clean rooms and Free WiFi-Free morning breakfast (not full service by any means (continental style with pastries, fruit, yogurt, coffee)-Free wine and cheese hour in the early evening and warm cookies at night with milk (marginal quality, but nice touchesNow to some of the negatives:-The whole guest experience was not worth the very hefty price tag. While the free food and drinks were nice, it was really annoying not having a full service restaurant in the hotel (although there are plenty of places nearby). We ended up going across the street to The Vendue for some delicious breakfast. The water in the lobby was not refilled often, and the coffee was often cold in the later morning.-For parking, you must pull your car around to a front parking spot on the street. We found the valet guys failed to come out sometimes, and we often had to go inside to find one. We would also call for our car and not see it for a least 15 minutes-Somewhat minor... But there is no onsite gym. The front desk said we could get a ""discount"" at a local gym. The gym ended up being pretty far away, and the gym attendant said there was no discount for hotel guests and charged us $15.00 each for a quick workout... (Might not matter to you though)This is definitely a great option in Charleston near many great restaurants and shops. With the hefty price tag, I would definitely rate the whole experience as 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to four for the delicious evening cookies.Great hotel with outstanding service! Delicious complimentary breakfast each morning. Very convenient to several excellent restaurants and good shopping. The nightlife in this part of town is also a lot of fun! Spent my 50th birthday here and had a wonderful time!Great location. The rooms were large and very high ceilings. Great atmosphere. The breakfast service to the room was a nice treat. Only wish they had a Resturant for hot food for breakfast. The wine and cheese hour was well attended. Unfortunately there was not a lot of seating so a number of people were sitting on floor. You could take it back to room but we wanted to visit with friends. The cookies and milk at night were a nice treat. Would definitely stay here if when we come back!!!Really enjoyed this place!  The rooms are a nice size and the beds are SUPER comfy.  The lobbies are beautiful as well and serve complimentary coffee and tea.  The location is PRIME as you are walking distance from many great restaurants, shops, White Point Gardens, etc.  It doesn't get much better.  Also, you can get breakfast delivered to your room, the atrium, or the rooftop in the morning at the hour you choose.  The breakfast foods are from a local bakery called Saffron, and they are quite tasty!  Also, the staff is very nice and accommodating.Beautiful and clean hotel that makes you feel right at home. The harbor is a stone throw away but quiet enough to make you think your on your own island. The added bonus of breakfast served to you, wine and cheese in the afternoon and cookies with milk for dinner is just the icing to the cake. I will definitely be back.Stayed here for 3 nights and loved it!The location is perfect as its on the water plus walking distance to any type of restaurant you want to go to downtown.The staff was helpful in suggesting different options for some of the touristy activities in Charleston.Onsite parking is nice and I was able to get items out of my car when needed. But I prefer not to have to valet a car. Although having my car parked securely inside the hotel garage made it secure and a nice benefit.The hotel itself is like an old mansion, and not a hotel. The rooms are very nice and furnished like an old mansion. There's no awful standard hotel furniture here. All the furniture looked more like an expensive antique.The beds and mattresses are great. Hotel was quietIf you want 24/7 room service and the amenities of a huge hotel you won't like it here, but for friendly service, something unique, great location and a comfortable bed you can't go wrong at the Harbour View Inn.A great hotel.  The staff was very polite and helpful, the room was nice and very clean.  But the best little secret is the breakfast, it is free and great.  We also loved the location, quiet but close enough to some of Charleston's best restaurants.  We will be returning when we make it back to Charleston.As Inn's go in Charleston, this is a very good place to stay since it is located in the center of the main part of town.  Close to restaurants, shops, art, and a quick drive to get over to Sullivan's Island for some beach time.The staff is very professional and helpful.  Afternoon snacks and drinks are a nice touch and they valet your car.Pricing is way under $300 per night and a value considering some of the pricing of other places in and around this establishment.","This hotel had it all. The check in was adequate but there are so many amenities that come with the hotel. They were note explained well to us. Our room had a view of a power station but who cares! The room was fabulous. It was huge. Turn down service in the evenings with robes on the bed and chocolates. The hotel uses an aromatherapy throughout the facility so it has a wonderful fragrance. They serve complimentary wine and cheese in the evening, cookies and milk at 9 PM and breakfast is served when you want and you have options of having it in the atrium, your bedroom or on the terrace. The location is fantastic, right by the river and park. There is a free shuttle pick up right outside the hotel. Easy walk to The Battery, Historic District, French Quarter, and City Market. They do encourage valet parking and it is $20 a day. We kept a set of car keys and were able to retrieve items from our car that we didn't want to carry into the hotel.There is no restaurant on site and no bar but the evening wine is free so no complaints. We loved our room and the little perks that came with the reservation. We would come back here in a heartbeat. It is a bit of a splurge for us but it was a very positive experience. The aromatherapy just made me feel happy when I stepped inside the facility. Oh the little things that mean so much!Everything at this establishment is top notch!  In the heart of a downtown convenience is a huge priority and the valet service is absolutely perfect.  Since everywhere in downtown is walkable from here it just makes sense to flip them your keys and head out!  We stayed in a room with french doors opening to a balcony overlooking Waterfront Park and the harbor.  If we could afford it we would stay here every weekend!  Highly recommend.This is a wonderful hotel -from the courteous staff, to the wonderful breakfast in the morning and drinks and cookies in the evening.  The location was perfect - on the water and close to everything downtown.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Charleston for a visit. Located right on the harbor as the name would indicate.The rooms are a good size with a beautiful bath, comfortable, four poster beds, nice linens. There is a large piece of furniture which houses the television, plenty of drawer space, small refrigerator and safe.There are many lovely amenities in the hotel. First of all, a complimentary breakfast, very nice choices, which can be delivered to your room, the atrium, or the rooftop in nice weather. There is always coffee and tea available in the atrium. Wine and cheese in the afternoon and cookies and milk in the evening. The staff is attentive and eager to please. Be advised that not every room has a view, so book early.If I ever have the occasion to visit Charleston again, and I hope I do, this will be where I book my accommodations.This is my 2nd stay at this hotel.  The first time I had a great room (king size bed) and wonderful view from my balcony.  Upon my return to Charleston it was an easy choice to stay here again, but I regret my decision.  Upon my 2nd visit, we were given a room with 2 beds and when asked about a King bed which was requested in reservations, we were told it wasn't available on the one night of our 2 night stay.  In addition, we had no view, but of the power lines from our window.  The weather was bad, so walking around wasn't an option, but staying inside and renting a movie wasn't an option either.  They have about 5 channels on the TV with no Pay for View or Movie Channels available.  In addition, the maids have the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  During my first stay I was packing to leave prior to check out time (a few hours prior) and the maid started banging on my door.  I announced I would be awhile and to come back later.  5 minutes later the maid started banging again...I again told her I wasn't ready...again, she came back within 5 minutes and started her banging again...this happened about 5 times within 30 minutes. I finally came out of the room to discuss with the Housekeeper about her need to bang on the door at 9 am when check out time was 12 noon.  She did apologize, but I wasn't sure if she understood what I was saying.  The second trip the Maid didn't even knock on the door, but walked in without announcement while my Husband was in the bathroom.  And then she seemed ""bothered"" we were occupying the room during her time to clean.  We left the room briefly, but with the rain decided it might be better to sit in the sitting room while she was cleaning.  When we walked back towards our room the maid from my first visit was pushing her cleaning cart through the hallway.  We were walking by as she pushed her cart in front of us and said ""excuse me"" as if we were in her way.  I wonder how much training the housekeeping staff has had for their positions...certainity no customer service. While the towels were plush, I am not crazy about shower curtains especially at a 4 Star Hotel. The bathroom had empty boxes that would normally hold shower caps, q-tips, etc.  It was humorous that 2 boxes were displayed as an amenity, but were empty. The positive of the hotel is obviously its excellent location for enjoying downtown Charleston, the Bell Staff is polite and helpful, the beds are comfortable and we enjoy the warm cookies in the evening, but for the price it isn't worth the stay and I'll be staying somewhere else in downtown Charleston.  The late afternoon wine &amp; cheese gathering isn't great either as an employee stands behind the bar with the wine and a pile of dollars she puts out on the bar as to encourage tipping...so tacky.I have to add after I wrote this review the hotel followed up with me from my in-room comment card.  They offered me a complimentary night at the hotel on my next visit to Charleston.  I have taken them up on it and will attempt to stay here again in a few weeks.  I appreciate their efforts and look forward to their improvements.I loved this hotel more the longer I stayed.  The front desk was so helpful for dinner reservations as well as tourist attractions.  They were friendly, helpful and entertaining.  The rooms were comfortable and well appointed.  The parking was convenient and the location was great.  Free breakfast was just and added plus.  It's a great place to stay!Amazing hotel with great service!  Very helpful staff with wine and cheese and milk and cookies as well as turn down service and a room service breakfast.  Great location for walking on King Street, and the market place - would recommend this hotel to everyone traveling to Charleston.Fantastic hotel. The best we have stayed at in Charleston. Clean,well-appointed rooms. Great facilities and delicious breakfast options. Nothing bad to say about the place.I'd consider myself a no-frills lodgings person- give me a coffee maker, give me a fridge, give me a room that doesn't have dirty touch marks on the doors and light fixtures (and properly working climate control) and I'll be happy.So for me, the Harbourview Inn was a bit of a dissappointment.(please note my stay was in July 2007, so things may have changed since.)I do give it a reluctant 4 stars.  I stayed in one of the historic suites.  I liked the cookies, tea and coffee.  Nice touch.  I liked the rooftop deck and view of the harbor and adjacent park.  The valet service was very good- the valets at the time were polite and helpful.  Having a memory foam mattress was a nice plus.  The room safe was bulky and secure.The window shades needed a lock to stay open, and in our case, I had to use a luggage case or magazines, otherwise it hung loose in the middle of the window.  Its in a great location, close to everything with a good rooftop view of the harbor, which is reflected in the price.  For what I paid, I thought I would be getting more for what I paid.  I was a bit underwhelmed.  To that extent, the next time I'm in Charleston, I'll probably end up trying another place.Overall, though, you'll probably be satisfied with your stay.Mister picked this hotel because it was #2 on Travelocity. It's cute, small and the rooms are nice and clean + it's away from the touristy area of Charleston, so it's quiet. The hotel is also just off the tourist center, yet close enough to walk almost everywhere. And the hotel staff were so helpful with suggestions and directions. Our room had a King Tempurpedic bed and though it was right in the Atrium, it was very quiet.  I recommmend the Harbourview Inn- when we come back to Charleston (soon I hope), we'll stay here again.While it's true the staff was very nice and the rooms were clean with comfortable beds, I'm not sure that is all I should get for $350/night.  The wine/cheese was laid out in a dark, crowded area of the hotel.  Why they are not playing up their strengths (the view) is beyond me.  Both mornings we went down for breakfast, there were 2 bran muffins in an otherwise empty plexiglass case.  Again, not what I'd expect for the price.  3 baskets of cookes on a cart by the front desk being picked over by kids isn't exactly appetizing either.There is no fitness center, business center, bar, restaurant, or sundries shop.  Those were all major disappointments.  Also, we had a penthouse room that was MUCH smaller than we expected.  Maybe 200 sq. ft. not counting the bathroom.My husband picked this place because he thought it was the best of the best, but after our trip we realized that there would have been many better options for us for about $150-$200 cheaper/night.  I say save the money and spend it on dining and shopping!This is a very nice hotel in a great area of Charleston. You can very easily walk to restaurants, shops, historic sights, and more. We stayed here for 3 nights without a car and didn't miss having one! Every morning we had free room service breakfast included. Our room was very clean and there was a rooftop shared deck where you could sit outside. No complaints- this is a safe bet if you want a clean, nice hotel in downtown Charleston.I went here recently for a 4 night stay. My first impression is the staff was great and very helpful as this was my first time in Charleston. The rooms were very clean but a little dated in the decorations. The stay was very enjoyable. Free breakfast brought to room and a treat of cookies and milk if you like at 9:00pm. I saw where someone posted that they only had 5 channels on their tv. They said it was raining that day. I must say it rained while I was there but I would not let it stop me from getting out. I couldn't see staying in a hotel rain or no rain and watch tv. The hotel is in a ideal location. You are very close to all the nice resturants and scenic sites. There might be more impressive places to stay in the area but you will pay alot more for it. In all I would do it again. I would recommend if you stay try to get a 4th floor room overlooking the harbor. That would be a difference maker alone.Perfect! Staff was great, room was great, evening reception was great. I have already booked another stay.The Harbourview Inn is a lovely place to stay while in Charleston. The Inn location was great and close to riverfront and all the best restaurants in Charleston. The staff was extremely attentive and quick. Our room was beautiful and extremely clean. We particurlarly liked the Tempurpedic Bed, a great little touch. We enjoyed our stay at the Harbourview Inn very much.Great location.  Great views.  Great staff - very friendly.  Included in price: afternoon tea, breakfast in your room, wine and cheese, and cookies and milk.  Rooms are smaller than I would have expected for the price.This is a very nice hotel in a great location. I stayed here for one night with my family and we were very impressed with the service and amenities. We loved all the extras included in our room rate - wine and cheese in the evening, milk and cookies at night, turndown service with chocolates, and breakfast! I will definitely stay here again on my next visit to Charleston.My husband and I stayed here for our wedding back in 2008.  It was a fantastic hotel, located right in the center of everything.  We stayed in a historic wing room, and it was great.  The staff was fantastic, and even though it wasn't cheap, we were willing to splurge - it was our wedding weekend after all, and it was totally worth it.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.I was really pleased with this hotel, and it was a very reasonable price. Absolutely all the appointments were up to date in the rooms and the bathroom was especially well done. Staff were really friendly and the location was excellent - centrally located yet at the end of a nice quiet street. We had a room with beautiful exposed brick and amazingly high ceilings. The breakfast was more than generous and I love that they bring it to your room. Free wi-fi too. I love this hotel!",,,,"['went', 'weekend', 'girl', 'trip', 'inn', 'hotel', 'great', 'location', 'staff', 'superb', 'ultra', 'friendly', 'perks', 'icing', 'cake', 'size', 'rooms', 'bathrooms',

Once there, my room was not ready so I had to wait in the reception area.  The rooms were clean but not really any views of Charleston.  The best part about this hotel was the free nightly happy hour and breakfast.  Those two amenities made up for the wait for my room.Stayed here Sunday - Tuesday for convenience. The lobby is nice, there is a large atrium and a bar right in the center. The elevators are quick, free breakfast in the morning with a made to order omelet station, fruits, cereal and pastries. Our room (322) was....outdated and not very clean. The carpets were old, the shower had stains and cracks, we found various hairs on the bed sheets and towels that were not ours...I know...it makes me cringe just thinking about it. There were also various strands of hair in the sink, stuck on and dry. We knew the hotel was at capacity so there was no use in trying to switch rooms. The view of this room is an empty parking lot.They offer free happy hour from 5:30-7:30 (beer and wine only) BUT beware, the free drinks are located at another small bar behind the buffet, if you order from the bartender she will charge you, I actually got a little annoyed that she didn't clarify this for us. Other guests we were with are the ones who informed us that the free drinks were located in the back. The light snacks are cheese and crackers and chips and salsa. Mike &amp; Chuck the bellman/shuttle drivers were GREAT! They were so helpful with my bags and happily drove us to two separate destinations on two separate occasions, one was downtown. You can't beat that! When Mike checked me into my room he also asked me if the temperature was ok and then he adjusted it for me...I have never had a bellman ask me that so I was super impressed! There is a convenience store in the lobby with sodas, toiletries, traveling trinkets and clothes! You can charge any items to you room which I found convenient because the credit card machine kept saying ""connection error.""Unfortunately Mike and Chuck could not make up for the state of our room!Not too happy with the management at this hotel.  Stayed for a convention. On night one we realized our room was a single when it should be a double. Management didn't fix it, their solution was to bring up a comforter for the pull out. Didn't get much sleep that night and my back still hurts. The noise of the lobby kept me awake as well.The happy hour and breakfast almost made up for it.We had Internet access but it was very spotty and only worked in certain areas of the room. Hard to get any work done when the Internet keeps cutting out.On our last day we asked for late checkout since our sessions didn't end until 11:15. They very reluctantly gave us 11:30 when I know others staying here got 12:00 when they asked the previous day. Don't make excuses to your guests, be a problem solver and make it work!We stayed here Saturday night to Monday morning last week for my boyfriend's cousin's wedding. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised! The layout inside is typical of Embassy suites (see pics). We had a suite - 2 double beds in the room, one roll-out sofa. Nothing bad, nothing spectacular. The things that stood out the very most to me were - 1. The beautiful ballroom (we stayed in the hotel for a wedding. The wedding and reception were in the same venue, where the convention center is.)2. Happy Hour. FREE happy hour in the main lobby from 5:30-7 daily. Have you ever heard of such a thing? Not I. Not til this place. Granted it's not top shelf but who would expect that anyway. Dollar tips and happy sips!3. Breakfast was amazing. (See my pic.) probably the best of Hotel breakfast that I've ever had. It's a breakfast buffet of pancakes, French toast, eggs, home fries, fruits, cereal, juices, milk, coffee, yogurt, pastries, AND an omelet bar where they make customized omelets to order!4. Towels. This may seem like a minute detail but I LOVE hotels with towels that aren't stiff or extra bleached, these were just....clean! Their towels were all newer and I just loved it! Another plus - this place is close to many things, even Walmart. AND right across the street from Tanger Outlets. Yay!I'm a fan of this place and would definitely recommend it to others!Very poorly managed, pretty much sums it up.  Had expected HHonors Diamond treatment only to find out that this place is filled with surly staff who could not give a rip about any requests.  Even though it was not fully booked the night before or after, an early check in (I'm talking 3:40 PM) and late checkout (asked for 12:00 noon) both proved to be impossible.  MyWay treats in the room? -- forget it.If you're staying here (which I will not be, ever again) be warned that weekends are filled with family reunions (you can tell them from the tee shirts) making the breakfast a feeding frenzy and leaving a lot of trash in the hallways.I was (am) pretty disgusted with this place.I want to start by saying that I travel often and I have stayed at a few Embassy Suites in different cities.  This hotel was booked by our Family Reunion committee, so prior to my arrival, I contacted the hotel to inquiry about shuttle service from the airport and to the downtown area. The staff were helpful and friendly. The hospitality increased when I arrived.  My shuttle driver who picked me up at the airport was a wealth of information.  He informed me about the complimentary evening appetizers and breakfast.  I was glad to hear about both. The staff also told me about local public transportation and this came in handy during the weekend.  Check-in was quick and easy and when I saw my room, I was pleased - it was spacious and clean.  I decided once I got settled to check out the managers reception (complimentary drinks and cheese/crackers, hummus, and tortilla chips.  It was a great and a nice way for the family to meet and greet before the official family activities began.  The staff were attentive and so nice with all the chaos going on (During my stay-three family reunions and a large church convention) to maintain good customer service when large groups are involved.  Overall, the experience was Outstanding!!  I would recommend this hotel to everyone if this is a convenient place for you to stay.  If you don't drive - Uber Car Service Is Available and they were provided great service too!!Side Note:  Tanger Outlet Mall is 2 Minutes Away - Hotel Shuttle will drive you there and you can call for a pick-up when done.Bed bugs.  My husband is covered in bites and he was there for 3nights. When he called them to let them know the manager apologized and offered 1night stay.  Uh...I don't think Its worth another night with bugs eating us while we sleep.  GrossHappy hour is so good.  We stay here every time we visit Charleston and we are never disappointed. Clean rooms, courteous staff and wonderful breakfast and happy hour. Good job guys!My wife and I stayed here for a convention paid for by my employer.  Since we didn't have to pay out of pocket for the room our expectations of the experience were initially indifferent.  I have to say I would pay full price to stay here again.Our room was clean and large.  The furniture was very comfortable and there were two flat screen tv's.  All the service we experienced was courteous and polite.  Every question we asked about the building or locations around the area to visit were answered promptly and with enough information to prevent the need to ask a follow up question.  I didn't eat any of the food there using their room service option but I have to say that their complimentary breakfast with their cook to order omelets was amazing!  And their happy hour had good beer options and snacks.  I wouldn't argue with the quality of their complimentary meals and drinks.My wife and I could stay here for an extended time and feel comfortable spending most of our time in the room.  My only issue was the fact that they don't offer free internet to non-members and their pay-per view channel charges nearly the same amount as it would cost to see a film in the theater.I had an accident in route to embassy suites this am. They actually sent an courtesy van to see if I was ok and if I needed a ride. So nice.It's a standard Embassy Suites... Maybe even above average.  It's a good location for the convention center or outlet malls.  Otherwise you better rent a car.  If your stranded car-less at a convention it's a great location!  Close to the airport!  Plenty of 'off campus' food and shopping options within a mile.Harold's Hotel Happy Hour is the best well known secret ever!!Can I say I'm a big fan of this place?Anyone staying here get's to have free Happy Hour!  From like 5:30pm to 7:30 pm.  Yes it's two whole hours and there's snack food included.There's no choice for the beer on tap but they did have Miller Lite on this night in particular.I try to get there as often as I can as they are so good to me.BTW: dont' forget to Tip.  Just because it's free doesn't mean the bartender is working for free as well.  After all it's not like it's self service.The room we are in smells of cat pee. The floor is gross. The beds are small and uncomfortable. They charge $3 for a bottle of water in the room. I paid the $3 because they also have regular glasses instead of individually packaged disposable cups and I will not use a real glass at a hotel (and you shouldn't either). I woke up this morning feeling disgusting. I will never stay here again.And they charge for local calls. Seriously? What hotel does that anymore?!My husband and I chose this hotel because the hotels downtown were insanely expensive. We much rather would have stayed down there but we ended up saving a ton so it was worth it to us. The rooms are quite large and clean, which was nice. The staff are very accommodating and friendly. They offer breakfast included in the rate which is almost inedible but free so there's that. Tip: stick with fruit and cereal, the cooked food might actually make you sick. The walls between the rooms are quite thin so you do tend to hear a lot of what is going on with other people. A lot of families stayed here, probably because it's more affordable and we heard a lot of children. They might have a shuttle that goes down town, but don't hold me to that. My husband and I drove into downtown. The hotel does have a parking lot which is included in your stay. Overall, my husband and I were happy with our choice because we ended up saving over $100 by staying here.I've always liked the attention to detail and nods to luxury of Embassy Suites in which I've stayed over the years. This particular one, however, is an exception. Catering to convention groups, the North Charleston Embassy Suites appears to take its guests for granted. The first check-in clerk we had gave us confusing and erroneous information about amenities as well as transportation. We opted to consult the other clerks after this experience. Our room furnishings displayed signs of becoming threadbare and in need of cleaning. There was no caffeine coffee in our suite. Wi-fi costs $4.95 a day. The maids neglected to clean our room one day, even though we were out of it most of the day. Finally, this was the first hotel of its level I've been in in years that doesn't provide complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby. I had to schlepp over to Starbucks, a 5-minute walk across the boulevard, to purchase hot drinks. This locale does provide the usual Embassy Suites evening cocktail/snacks as well as included breakfast. All in all, however, we found it to be a comparative disappointment.I arrived around 9pm, the front desk staff is a bit novice. Beautiful lobby.the rooms are big, beds small. Maybe full size but definitely not queen size! Not at all plush.heres the kicker, there is NO free wifi in the room! You have to pay 9.95 per day, per device. This is not the dark ages. Even the HOJO has free wifi. Free wifi is available in the lobby... thats like 100 strikes aganist you.The breakfast was what saved this hotel. HOT FOOD. And you can also get it made to order. Eggs are terrible.Nice bar area with good selection of wine.  Good place to get a drink before going to an event next door at the Performing Arts Convention Center or the Coliseum.We booked this room through a hotel booking website for the final night of our vacation &amp; got a stellar rate on the room. The bummer was that they didn't have a king bed left &amp; my husband &amp; I had to sleep ""1950's style"" in separate double beds. Overall the staff was super friendly, the room &amp; bathroom were super clean, the beds were super comfy, the free cocktail hour was appreciated, &amp; the free hot breakfast was fabulous. They also had little Charleston Chews in the candy dish at the reception desks (cute),Yes, it is a 15-20 minute drive to historic Charleston...but looking at a map prior to booking could have told you that fact (unless you have a teleporter or flying car, then Go You! :-) ). Overall, we would gladly consider staying here again when visiting Charleston.Nice hotel. Checkin was efficient. Rooms are suites and nicely done. Very close to airport. All the action however is downtown which is a 20 minute cab ride.My favorite hotel from my recent cross-country tour. Unusually good breakfast, generous cocktail hour, and clean, up-to-date rooms. It is not close to downtown Charleston, and that's a consideration, but I travel for a living and can honestly say this hotel does everything right.","Great rooms for a romantic weekend getaway. But location is not good for walking around the city it is very far from downtown. $15 per person for city shuttle and the last shuttle comes back at 10:20pm on a Saturday night. We thought it was way too early. The breakfast bar is just ok. Pancakes were rubbery and the potatoes were not good. the fresh omelet bar had a very long line every morning. :-( I would have liked a fresh waffle maker.We will not stay here again. We went down for the complimentary drinks. There was a Labrador, a pet, in the seating area on top of a table barking. Nobody made it stop. Eventually, the owner took the dog to a room on the second floor. I asked the girl at the desk if pets were allowed in the rooms. She said, ""Yes"".We took our drink to our room. We then found out they charge $10 per device in the room. Really? WiFi charged per device? Can you get any more greedy?Definitely not coming back.The hotel itself provided 5 star service, pleasant staff, free happy hour and breakfast, BUT the food SUCKED.  The breakfast line was long, and the poor breakfast lady overcooked everyone's omelettes  b/c she was doing 5 omelettes at a time.  I ordered room service for 2 consecutive nights, disappointing both nights.  Minus two stars for the bad food.This is a great, clean hotel, with a very friendly staff.  The free breakfast buffet is amazing and  is comparable to a $15 breakfast you'd get at a nicer restaurant.  They also offer a free happy hour which is a bonus.  The only knock (and the reason they lost a star) is the $9.95 they charge if you want free wifi in your room.We have attended a few events at the convention center and they were all wonderful.Getting ready to turn in on night two of a two-night stay at this establishment.  Too early to write a review?  Perhaps, but I will live on the edge and say that this was a fabulous stay.  We were in from VA for an Irish Dance Competition.. our daughter did quite well, thanks for asking.  That competition was at the attached convention center, and of all the events we have been to, this was by far the most well thought-through venue for such an event.  With hundreds of Irish Dancers at these events, all dancing and practicing in corners and hallways, you can imagine how many times I've nearly lost an eye just walking to the BATHROOM... but not at this convention center.  The traffic patterns and general flow of the facility made such accidents nearly impossible.  The room is great, breakfast and happy hour are included, and wonderful.   Only complaint I have is about the in-room refridergator... had to turn it on when we got here... took several hours to cool the sodas we had with us.  Minor complaint. For those Yelpers who complain about downtown Charleston (which we spent all day exploring by the way) being nine miles away, well... try using a little technology and pull up Google maps before you book your next hotel!  Not a surprise that this hotel is located outside of downtown... it is clearly NEAR THE AIRPORT!  Good grief some of you peoplemake me worry about the possibility of an intelligent future of humanity!  Enjoying our stay... and the drive to downtown is not so bad that it can't be managed... unless of course, you can't use a map or GPS device.  Embassy Suites.. nice job!Copy of my letter to the GM: It is not often I can take the time to write about my travel experiences, but my recent stay the the Embassy suites North Charleston SC deserves a moment of my time.From check in to check out the entire experience was a pure delight. My business travel schedule has recently increased to weekly trips from my previous schedule of only 4 - 6 trips annually, and to be able to actually enjoy this experience in North Charleston was a welcome surprise.I wish I could remember name of the front desk supervisor who checked me in (Tues March 22, 2011- m/blond hair, probably late 20's to early 30's) but he took the time to find me a quiet room in a far corner, high floor in a hotel booked to capacity.  Most appreciated after being in loud airports for 20+ hours!Regarding my room service meal Tuesday night for dinner, I can say categorically it was the best hotel room service meal I have ever had- full stop.  My wife and I are admitted 'Foodies' and have eaten at many of the finest restaurants in the world including Alain Ducasse Paris, Eric Ripert (Le Bernardin, NY), and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in London.And while I cannot in good conscience rank the food in the same league as those meals, I mention them just as a point of reference that I hold the quality of my meal at the Embassy Tuesday night in such high regard, especially for Room Service!  I enjoyed it so much in fact, I took a photo of it on my iPhone to I could attempt to re-create it at home! (Photo attached - Seared Sea Scallops, Mushroom Risotto).The freshness and preparation of the scallops were both perfect! The risotto was amazing, and the sauce brilliant.Further, the server (Hal?) who delivered it presented my meal and beverages to me most happily, professionally and seemed GENUINELY thrilled to be doing so.And finally, BEYOND FURTHER, I happened to mention to him that there was a spot of mold on my ice cubes taken from the 8th floor ice machine (to be expected from time to time, especially in the humid southern climate)  and asked him to please notify management so it could be addressed.  He agreed to do so and with great courtesy and wishes for an enjoyable meal he left my room.About 5 minutes later a knock on the door. It was my waiter, returning with a full metal pitcher of ice he had collected from the kitchen ice machine! Unsolicited! Absolutely refreshing to experience initiative and courtesy above and beyond the call. I have been a loyal Hilton Honors guest for several years, and our entire family have long been Hilton loyalists back to my father and grandfather.Please know that my experience this past week has only increased my loyalty to and appreciation of the Hilton / Embassy brands and I will make you my first choice whenever possible.I've stayed here a few times over the years, and though the lobby is nice, the rooms are outdated and in need of renovation.  The floors and interior of the rooms are of questionable sanitary condition.  Though the staff is friendly enough, this hotel is a bit on the noisy side, and parking is horrid after 6pm, since the coliseum is within the same lot.  If you are in the area, I'd recommend staying elsewhere, homewood suites is definately a better property if they have availability.If you go when they are having reunions or meetings in the area then you will hate it! Other than that, it is okay. The bartenders were a little rude. The housekeeping is slow. The omelet guy was the best out of Every Embassy I visited from any states.The food for our meetings is great. I love the staff and the venue. Im a local and I often stay here for a change of scenery.My mother run a convention for kids and for the last 6 or so year we have chosen this place to hold it. HOWEVER one would think knowing that kids were coming in the would offer a family friendly menu in the dinning room. All I wanted was chicken fingers that didn't cost 22 dollars via room service...but no I had to order this fancy smancy chicken dish. I do not have expensive taste! BUT....The one thing that blew my mind was the shuttle folks. TAMI AND CHUCK. WOW!!!! They were great!! The shuttle was only 5 bucks verses 25 for a cab. And not only that these guys went above and beyond to help us out and make us happy. They even stayed on longer than they had to, so we (A group of 8 people) Could have dinner and see a tour so we didn't have to blow 25 more each on the cab system. So bravo to the shuttle people and poo to the food. Other than than the hotel is a hotel is a hotel....the bed a soft though :)Nice hotel, airport convenient.  But...if your objective is to get downtown and say, have dinner at someplace other than the Wendy's nearby THIS hotel, don't stay here.Was in town for a convention and the facilities are exactly what one needs, but all the FUN is at least 20 minutes by cab.  Work a deal at the front desk here to make sure you can get BACK to the hotel from downtown, or better yet...STAY DOWNTOWN!We stayed here this past week and the front desk was rude on the 2 occassions that we had to deal with them. Definitely not what I expected from an Embassy Suites hotel. Our flight was delayed and we did not get to check in until 1am friday morning. The lady at the front desk didn't say hello, welcome, or anything. Then went on and acted like she was busy and we were interrupting her (even though there is NOBODY ELSE around at that time). I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt that it is 1am but she forgot to give us our ticket/card for the free breakfast and manager's reception. When someone notified us that we need it in order to get free breakfast and drinks, we went up to the front desk and requested it. This time the MANAGER of all people was rather rude to us. When we said we never received the ticket/card, instead of asking for ID, he went on to ""quiz"" us such as our home address, our work address, etc. I felt like a criminal that needs to prove my existence. When we said a friend booked our room under the ""friends and family discount"", he went on to quiz us even more about this friend. It's a friend of a friend okay, jeez.. It really affected my experience with Embassy Suites. I used to rate Embassy Suites at the top of my list, but now I know that customer service isn't the same at all locations and will have to consider somewhere else next time.",,,,"['flew', 'trade',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/king-charles-inn-charleston,King Charles Inn,4.0,$$,79,"Got a great rate for the King Charles Inn on Travelzoo, plus with free parking in the back, we couldn't pass it up. When booking I had no idea how convenient this hotel is to everything you want in downtown charleston! You are a few minutes north of the historic district, and about 10 minutes south by foot from upper King street, apparently the new spot in Charleston for the cools restos and bars! And around the corner is the shopping district of King Street, my first stop after checking in because I forgot my sunglasses! (Thanks Forever 21!)Everyone was super friendly and accommodating, from Malcolm the nicest bell boy, to the check in staff, to the housekeepers! The rooms were well sized, though I accidentally got 2 double beds instead of a King bed for me and my boyfriend! I'm sure I could have asked for another room, but we were just ready to hit the road. The bathrooms were well sized and well stocked. The one complaint, though obviously not the fault of the hotel, is that it is on a busy street, so you hear the traffic at all hours. Particularly Monday morning, which was trash day, as well as the fire trucks coming down from the station just up the block. Perhaps the rooms on the other side of the hotel were quieter, but it was fine. Finally, the pool/deck is under construction, which wouldnt matter because it's the winter, however going through the deck is the easiest way to access half of the rooms, so its a bit of a trek to get to them without this shortcut. Alternatively you can access these from the parking lot, which helps a bit on the long journey lol.The King Charles Inn has everything. It's centrally located, has a phenomenally accommodating staff, elegant rooms, and fantastic foods and little ""extras."" We were extremely pleased with our stay here! The rooms are a little on the small side, but the bathroom is large and everything is super clean. The hotel staff set up a pack and play crib for our 8-month-old baby prior to our arrival. There are fridges in each room and free water bottles. Everyday, they have a ""happy hour"" from 4:30-5:30 which includes cheese and olives (and of course wine which you can purchase). From 8-9pm, they put out freshly baked chocolate cookies (mm'mm!!) and tea. They breakfast is also nice and comparably priced to the local breakfast places. The best part of this hotel is its convenient location which is right in the heart of Charleston, within walking distance of multiple restaurants, tours, museums, etc. And as a super bonus, there's free parking which is great!Not impressed with this place at all.  The entire weekend, my friends and I (there were 4 of us total on a girls trip) were treated as if we were an inconvenience.  The staff was not friendly and did not seem eager to help with answering any sort of questions or providing suggestions on where to go or how to get there.  One staff member did recommend the pedi-cab, but there are only so many times you can pay $25.00 to go a mile down the road.The area that it is in was also unimpressive.  There were a few places to choose from to eat, but none that we wanted to visit...so we did have to travel by pedi-cab, taxi, uber the entire weekend.  The rooms itself are quite small, as are the beds.  I kind of wish we would have paid cheaper to go to a larger hotel, even if it was further away it may have been better customer service.Nice hotel in a great place. It's an older hotel, no views really, but the service, the rooms, and the location more than make up for it. You can walk most of downtown from here. Because who wants to drive in this area? My wife and I have been coming here for our anniversary for years and they always leave a small bottle of Lamarca in the room for us. How many hotels remember you and show appreciation like that?Arrived and was pleased w the hotel.  This is our first night and when I pulled the sheets back to get in bed, what did I find, "" pubic hair in the sheets!""  Not cool.  One more night left.  Had to get sheets from the front desk and re-make my bed.  Pretty irritated Update:  our second night was much better w free drinks offered, chocolate truffles, and like I mentioned before, a very friendly staff.  By no means would the incident keep us from staying here again, or keep us from recommending the hotel to friends.Not impressed with the hotel. It's not in a part of Charleston that I would have rather stayed in. The hotel is old and the corridors are tight. Our room was a ""long""way from the elevator and I have a bad back. The term "" boutique"" does not apply to this hotel. The pictures are deceiving. I am a hotel designer so I am picky. Probably have to drive to the restaurant I want. Suggestions for dinner were not good. Luckily I look it up on Yelp and wasn't up to par with my taste!The location for this place is ideal. I can only think of the words elegant and essential. I suppose it's okay to refer to this as a boutique hotel and I think that is a compliment. If you are looking for a behemoth, keep searching this one is just so nicely appointed and comfy that I cannot image a better place to stay if you're looking to to be near the heart of downtown. At the core of the success here is the staff. They are dedicated to customer satisfaction and take professionalism to the next level. They remember you and they make you feel welcome at all times. It's difficult not to love a place that also offers free parking as an amenity. If you are coming to Charleston to see the town, then you can basically leave your car where you park it and walk to any place you want to visit. This is great for that historic feel you are probably looking for if you are spending time in Charleston. If you want a cookie cutter with a neon logo on it, you may be disappointed. But when the staff members remember our names, what we like to eat or drink and what we're planning to do with our days, I think it is a huge win. I was NOT just a room number here. I will be back and I would recommend it without ... wait for it ... reservation.Great location, rooms were a little small but we adjoined two to fit 6 (2 smaller kids). Great service, nice staff. Pool was closed for renovation which was a little bit of a bummer given we didn't know it. Parking was free and accommodated our big rooftop box. Overall experience, great! Thanks!I stayed here this past weekend with 7 other gals for a bacherlorette party &amp; it was the perfect spot for us. We had conjoined rooms &amp; enough space to all get ready. You can only imagine right? Our rooms were clean &amp; the beds were comfy. The hotel is super cute inside. The decor is elegant/southern chic. Free parking is a huge plus &amp; it was centrally located to everything we were walking to. I would definitely stay here on another trip to Charleston.Found this inn on yelp and was completely pleased. Quaint, charming, quiet, elegant. Staff was very attentive. Bar is elegant. Breakfast on the terrace. Walking distance to the Historic District. Very pleased. Also must check out Justine's Diner around the corner..We really liked the hotel!  Dave checked us in and was super nice and helpful.  When we walked back thru the lobby later, the hotel clerks greeted us by name!  Our room was very comfortable, clean and nice.  We even had windows that opened! The location of the hotel is right where you want to be.What about parking, you may ask? ... FREE!  Amazing!  And I noticed that the doormen seemed to keep an eye on the parking area.  We found plenty of restaurant choices near, I know we'll be staying here again!I stayed at the King Charles INN over columbus day weekend. I was greatly disappointed. The Inn appears to be a beautiful and charming boutique Charleston hotel on their website, unfortunately the pictures are deceiving. The second we arrived I knew I had made a huge mistake! The ""Inn"" in reality actually looks like a slightly dressed up Days INN or Best Western and during our stay l found out that our instincts were right, The King Charles Inn is actually a Best Western. The hallways are depressing with low hanging ceiling tiles, the rooms are small and drab with an unpleasant odor, and industrial size air conditioning units.   With that said, all of the above wouldn't have been as huge of an issue if the cost had been appropriate to the room/hotel, ie. if it were say 120.00 dollars a night. Then fine I would have been slightly disappointed that I wasted my romantic getaway with my husband staying at this hotel in Charleston but at least  I could have explained it away to myself by having saved money. The real rub came when I had to pay the exact same and infact more expensive room rate than some of the most beautiful real boutique hotels in the city that night (I made my husband stop in at 3 or 4 hotels on our stroll through the city to cost compare - it was really upsetting as this hotel was of equal or greater cost). I would have to say the lesson to be learned here is do not falsely advertise your facility, it is not a boutique hotel so don't make it appear that way on your website. If you don't give your clients false expectations, you won't have disappointed patrons. This is an average hotel charging boutique rates. If you are looking for a romantic getaway and are couple or family that is used to paying in the mid 3-400s/night then steer clear of King Charles Inn and book at the Vendue or any other number of beautiful boutique hotels in Charleston. The one positive thing I will say regarding this hotel is that the staff were all lovely.So delightful! Great city-center accommodations! Clean and elegant! Superb caring staff! Nicely appointed rooms with soft linens and comfy beds were a super place to sink into after a day of shopping on King Street, which is only a block away. Will stay here again for certain!Great little hotel a half step from the heart of downtown.  From the free parking, to the friendly front desk staff, to the clean and comfortable rooms, this hotel is an easy choice for visiting Charleston.  The location is ideal for walking to any restaurant or shop downtown, which is a huge plus because parking can be a nightmare, and just as easy to hop on the highway and explore surrounding neighborhoods and towns.  The price, while not rock-bottom is fair considering the ammenities and their competitors' pricing in the area.  Overall, had a nice stay, and would absoutely book here again.Great stay here in June for my bachelorette weekend. We got two adjoining rooms which was awesome. Unfortunately even though my maid of honor had requested an early check-in for us weeks in advance because we were all getting there early in the morning, we did not get our rooms until late afternoon. It was okay because we got to hang out by the pool but my maid of honor felt really bad because she had spoken with someone who said an early check-in would be no problem for us and then we didn't get one. The AC and fridge in our room did not work well, but other than that we had no problems. The staff were really great especially the guys at the pool!! We only encountered one rude employee and that was Selena at the front desk who told us to be quiet when we were walking in Saturday night. The location of the hotel can't be beat, definitely recommend!Great location. Since the rooms were booked as a group we did not follow up on what type of room we had. Our room had a standard bed with 3 very small uncomfortable pillows. We have had cruise ships rooms that were larger. We tried to move to another room but it was too late, all the rooms were booked. Still a great place just make sure you know in advance about your room accommodations.The location is central enough, on Meeting Street, and since this was my first time to the city, that was super important as I could walk everywhere I needed to. One thing I noticed quickly about the area in general is parking. Thankfully King Charles Inn has parking down below the hotel, but that fills up quickly and stays that way all afternoon and night, only clearing out a little around checkout. There is some parking across the street which is where I left my rental car for a couple days.The accommodations were pretty nice from my perspective with the classy Southern decor all around. I had a deluxe King for a couple nights which was enough space for all my luggage laid out. Not much of a view from my room, but lets in enough light. The front desk was courteous every time I entered or left. I did not partake of any of the other amenities or their restaurant / bar. Plenty of great restaurants nearby.Staying in downtown Charleston is not cheap, especially when making reservations only a few weeks ahead in late summer... that alone probably increased my nightly charge $50.Easily the best hotel we found in Charleston in terms of price and location. Ok, so the bathrooms are small and the view is not great/non existent but they decor is lovely and they have free wifi and parking. Legit. Not to mention, everyone we came across, whether they were working and staying there, was super friendly and helpful. It's amazing what a quick hello in can do for one's morning outlook. It's also worth mentioning that although there is a pool, it's tres small (inappropriate for laps) and lined with glass sliding doors, on the other side of which is the hotel lounge and restaurant... bit too goldfish in a fish bowl for my liking. Still, would most definitely stay here again and recommend to people looking to stay in the city (town?) centre at an affordable price!It was great until the internet and cable stopped working. Loved the pool, the bed, the bathroom. Bad view, but I was on vacation. Who wants to stay indoors?! The welcome at 4:30pm was okay. Not enough fruits. Just grapes, and not great one's either. But everyone seemed to be having a good time. From 4:30pm to 5:30pm it's happy hour and you get $1 off drinks. I was not in the mood for drinking so it did not matter to me. Overall I would stay here again for sure.Highlights:Check-in is at 4pm but they had my room ready at 2pm. Awesome! In the meantime, since I got there at 11am they let me chill by the pool and they held on to my luggage. Had the pool to myself most of the time. It is a little awkward because the pool is literally next to a very busy street (Meeting Street). But whatever, when you are boiling hot, the focus becomes the cool water. Check-out is at 11am but they let me chill by the pool until I chose to leave at 1pm. I know, I love pools! LOL. :)But I also need internet and cable! Argh. Good thing is that the internet and cable went down in the morning when I was on my way out. If it had happened at night....that would have been a whole other matter!Wow, drove into Charleston on a spur of the moment trip. Found this place on Expedia. Had great reviews and free parking!! I see why the reviews are great. Older hotel but, this place is great! Room is super clean, above average toiletries, comfortable mattresses and the bar/pub on the second floor adjacent the lobby it great. The bartender (Taylor, I think) made a FANTASTIC old fashioned and my wife a terrific martini. He also suggested several local steak houses for us to decide on for dinner. The front desk was also very polite. Every now and then you run across a place to stay that deserves to time to write a review about. Keep up the good work guys.","The room was so nice and well decorated, but really the service at this hotel was the shining star. Our first day I turned on the shower and water was shooting EVERYWHERE, so we decided to just wash up and let the front desk know on our way out to breakfast. They were so gracious and it was fixed before we returned, you wouldn't even know that there was a water feature in our room an hour earlier! I have to say, this is such a wonderful little hotel, located right in the center of everything and I am so happy we decided to stay here. This was our first trip to the south and we stayed in a larger hotel in Savannah and here, at the King Charles Inn. This place was right up our alley, and even though there was construction going on next door we didn't even notice.Also, I must say that Taylor, the bartender, is just awesome! Really, I cannot say enough nice things! He is their secret weapon? Or maybe a hidden nugget of gold? Whatever you want to call him, he is a great conversationalist and can recommend excellent restaurants around town, things to absolutely not miss and things you can live without. We never like to be a tourist, more just travelers and we really enjoy the rare conversations that lead to little gems that are local favorites, or maybe something new and exciting.Thank you, for making our stay so relaxing and pleasant, it was a treat and we can't wait to return!The staff here goes above and beyond your expectations if you have any problems with your stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel for not only their southern hospitality but the cleanliness and also the fact that the rooms are very sound proof. We didn't hear anything from adjoining rooms or any road noise. The breakfast here was really good also. The kitchen staff here are very friendly. Thank you Maureen Sheridan at King Charles for making our honeymoon a time to remember.I really enjoyed my stay here. The rooms are up to date and furnished very nicely. The highlight for me was the shower,  closest thing to being in my own. The location is superb,  you are in a great place to walk anywhere downtown Charleston.  The front desk was more than helpful as I had a morning meeting, they held my luggage for me so I didn't have to lug it with me as I walked to my meeting. The pool is small but the overall feel of the hotel is great.What a great place to stay! Excellent location. You are centrally located to everything. The hotel staff was awesome. Jesse checked us in and gave us great shopping and tour tips. Aaron helped us out with where to go on our dining. Loved the free parking!  The rooms were clean and we had lots of towels. We will be back soon. Thanks for a wonderful birthday week!Stayed here recently for a romantic getaway to beautiful Charleston. I ended up booking it with a flight combo through American Express Travel and the hotel rate was significantly less than others in the area. Things we loved:Free parkingFree wifiFree cheese/daily happy hour Free bike storage (we rented bikes and they secured them in the manager's office for us--so nice!) Extremely clean and tasteful decorFree water bottles (2) every dayAmazing bartenders---espresso martini is on point!! Prime location (we don't mind a 10-20 minute stroll, so this was a great spot for us) Friendly serviceWe ended up having a room with an oversized bathroom (king bed on 4th floor)--it was great! I had read reviews about the balcony over the garage so didn't bother asking for one. We didn't use the pool (a bit small for the weekend crowd), but it was nice. Would definitely stay here again on our next trip!In a world where making a quick buck and treating customers with little to no respect has become standard operating procedure for many businesses, this hotel and their excellent staff are a CLASS ACT.On a Friday night at 6pm, after almost 8 hours in the airport, Delta finally canceled our flight to Charleston, and told us there were no flights available for the rest of the night and the first seats they had available for the next day wouldn't even get us in for dinner on Saturday.I immediately called the hotel, knowing it was one of the busiest weekends of the year for them (college graduations and Mother's Day) and told them that our flight was cancelled and that we needed to cancel the room. We were absolutely DREADING the thought of paying for the unused hotel room, but knew we would just have to suck it up and pay.The woman I spoke with at the King Charles Inn was instantly SO compassionate and genuinely sympathetic (a welcome change from dealing with horrendous Delta ""customer service"" all day); she said they wouldn't charge us for the room for either night. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT and asked her to repeat it twice just to be sure. After what was the worst day I have ever spent in an airport, the King Charles Inn was so lovely and hospitable, they were the bright point of our day, and we didn't even get to stay there... But we will from now on when we go to Charleston!!NIce place in the heart of Charleston!I loved our stay at the King Charles Inn.  Great location, clean rooms, free wifi, restaurant on-site for breakfast, light snacks, drinks, and desserts, friendly staff, and nice lounge area with fireplace.  My husband and I would absolutely stay at the King Charles Inn again on our next visit to Charleston.  I would recommend it to other travelers, as well.  The only downside would be that the rooms are fairly small, so if you are traveling with a family you may want to get a suite, or request a larger room.Excellent location in the midst of the historic district. Most things, except restaurants, close down around 5pm or so when the cruise ships typically leave. This hotel was definitely better than the typical Best Western. They were renovating the lobby and breakfast area so can't say much about that. Price is pretty reasonable for roughly $115 a night. Pros:-Excellent location in Downtown Charleston. Most attractions and restaurants are within walking distance.-FREE parking!!!-Hotel rooms and bathrooms are pretty updated.-Complimentary coffee and tea all day. Complimentary mini donuts, cupcakes, and danishes during breakfast hours and cheese and grapes during the late afternoon.Cons: -The rooms are TINY. The bed took up most of the room and that was it. It was really tight and pretty uncomfortable. Tips: -Book early for better rates. Prices went up as the date approached.This was originally a Best Western hotel that converted to this current incarnation. The location is good as we don't mind walking. Lower King street is a block away and most of the attractions are about 10 minutes away. The worst part of this hotel has to be the air conditioning unit-noisy and located right next to the bed at head level, this is unacceptable at this price point. Reading other yelp reviews, this is not an uncommon complaint.  Even after maintenance adjusted it twice, the noise level was too high to get a good night's sleep. I can forgive that some of the staff lacks the skills expected for a hospitality industry professional (smiling and volunteering information is an expectation). I can also overlook that the condition of the hotel is not in top shape (the Best Western does show).  What I can't forgive is that both my wife and I lost sleep which impacted the vacation. It may have a more sophisticated name now but it's like putting lipstick on a pig. It essentially is still a Best Western.GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!I requested assistance from the Maureen, the General Manager, on behalf of a client staying at KCI--she did a stellar job.  Can't wait to visit when I am in Charleston next time.This was a very lovely hotel. The location just can't be beat. The rooms are quaint and artfully decorated. The staff is very helpful from things like carrying our luggage up the stairs to giving us great recommendations to being good sports about being accosted by our drunk bride to me. The pool side wine and cheese is a wonderful touch. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for ideally located hotel in Charleston.This hotel is excellently located for visitors to Charleston. It is within walking distance of almost everything to do in the historic downtown area. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable, the only minor issue was being able to hear the people next door through the walls. The happy hour complimentary snacks and evening cookies and tea were a nice touch!Just had a great stay at the King Charles Inn. It is in a great location near restaurants and shops. The manager's reception at 430 has a good assortment of cheese, crackers fruit and discounted drinks. The hotel is well kept and the staff was very accommodating!Pretty good rooms for the price! Beds are very comfy, and everything is very modern in the rooms. Parking and wifi are free. Doorman is very friendly and a nice service. Upstairs from the check-in desk is a lounge area that is nicely heated compared to the outside frigid air when I visited. Location is good, just on the edge of the historic district.Downsides: No breakfast included. The gym is not attached to the hotel, and you have to pay $5 every time you want to use it. We had to change our reservation, and they called us at 5 AM pacific time to confirm this change in our reservation. Think about what time you're calling someone on the west coast when you're located on the east coast.Even with that, I would recommend this place to others.Edited - Maureen got back to me and apologized for the issue. We'll be staying there in April and we're looking forward to it.This is a beautiful hotel. The staff is so friendly and helpful! We were upgraded to a king suite from a queen. The only downside we had was the bed was very firm. I have a back problem and my back was actually hurting from sleeping on the bed. I had to take one of those very big yellow pillows and put behind my back to sleep comfortably. The hotel is in a great area. Able to walk to shops and restaurants. One restaurant you have to try if you're going to Charleston is Fleet Landing Restaurant. They have amazing food. It has been the best seafood I've had.This hotel was absolutely wonderful and charming. I stayed here for a romantic weekend getaway, and it was perfect. I was nervous about it being a ""chain"" hotel, but the Best Western company definitely kept it classy and in touch with historic Charleston. It has a parking garage/lot, with unlimited in-and-out, and it is within walking distance to everything downtown. The rooms are not huge, but they are very clean and well-kept. The bar at night serves great drinks, which you can enjoy while sitting in the rocking chairs on the patio that overlooks the street. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.Overall this is a pretty good hotel when you take into account the price, features, and location. I would stay here again. I have to admit I was skeptical about staying here. Best western is not a chain I usually frequent but the reviews seemed promising.  First off and most important, the price is very right. I was able to get a room through Hotwire for just over $100 a night. The exterior and interior hallways are a little shabby but the rooms are nicer. You can tell the rooms were recently remodeled or if not the cleaning staff is doing a hell of a job. It's not your typical remodel/cleanup job that looks like layers and layers of paint on top of dirt. Overall, everything is nice... the showers, bathrooms, decor, crown molding, room size, even the free internet that wasn't horrible. Tangent: why is free hotel internet always so crappy? That wasn't the case here.The location is great for seeing downtown historic Charleston. Everything is just a short walk away and the area feels safe. It's easy go get in and out of and best of all parking is free, free, free. My only real complaint is that the elevator is pretty wonky. The 1st level exit takes you to the back corner of the garage and it is inconvenient to get out.  The only exit from there is all the way on the other side of the building. I found it easier to just take the stairs but even then you had to navigate through the pool and lobby. It was rather odd but really just a minor inconvenience.""Best"" Western is right....best one I""ve ever seen.Let me start by explaining that I'm a self-proclaimed hotel snob.  I travel every week for work and stay in many hotels....and have even walked out of a few because they weren't 'good' enough - yes, this is the person that chose to stay at a Best Western.  I was headed to Charleston for work and looked on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FTripAdvisor.com&amp;s=826b4d47384079a3cabc100d2c4cc5530f4d29db33d6f47d5b816c5213ba2496"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">TripAdvisor.com</a> to find other reviews in addition to yelpers.  As work doesn't allow me to stay at a $400/night hotel, I needed to find something nice and affordable.  When I saw that the Best Western received the #8 rated hotel in all of Charleston, I thought I'd give it a try.  It did not disappoint - overall, it is quite nice.Pros:- Great location - walking distance to the market and lots of restaurants- Rooms are nice and updated - great bedding and soft feather pillows.  - iHome alarm clocks in room for iPod hook up- Large flat screen TV mounted on wall- Nightly 'manager special' cocktails on the 2nd floor lobbyCons:- Rooms are VERY small, but this isn't atypical of Charleston- Bathrooms are even smaller - at least in my room (317).  It was actually difficult to use - the door was almost like a partition between the shower and the vanity.  It was okay for my one night stay, but any longer and this would've been an issue. - The walls are quite thin.  I could hear the entire conversation going on in the room next to me and they weren't yelling by any means.  Thankfully they weren't late night chatterers or that would have been an issue.  Not a bad experience overall...I'd recommend it if you're on a budget.","Loved this hotel, I stayed this weekend for the second time and loved every minute. The staff is very friendly and the newly updated bar is great! It is in one of the best locations you could ask for, we walked to everything we did, restaurants, tours, the aquarium, and of course bars and it was never more then a ten minute walk. Pros:The bar! The reception when you check in is great.The staff, very friendly and helpful when giving recommendations.The rooms were extremely well maintained and comfortable.The price for what you get can't be beat.Cons:Only one, if you get a deluxe queen or king room and not a suite then your room will be a little small. For me this is no problem because with so much to do why would you be in there. If a smaller room is a bad thing for you (by small you still have a 5'x8' not used space of open area in the room) then upgrade to the suites, they are huge.Lastly be sure to look on their site for packages. Some of the third party sites don't show them and if you are looking to tour the city you can get some great discounts on there. We did the Poe package and got a copy of Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Gold Bug"", admission to Fort Moulteir, and a gift card to Poe's tavern for almost the same rate as just the room would have been.the general mgr informed me how much money they are losing on my reservation because I bought my room on priceline. I asked if they would consider refunding me one evening because I had an issue at home. she got very ugly with me and made me feel very unwelcome.This hotel has a $50 early departure fee that they dont have listedThanks Yelp for helping me find this place! After reading the reviews, I booked a room for a one-night stay in downtown Charleston the day off and called Best Western directly for the best rates. The rep on the phone was very helpful and gave me some useful information about the area. I got a room for Thursday night for $129 with the AAA discount. This hotel is located right in the heart of the Charleston...some of the hottest restaurants are just blocks away and of course King street is just a block away with a slew of shopping choices. With your overnight stay you get complimentary parking in the garage behind the hotel or in the lot across meeting street. That helps considerably knowing that it's hard to find parking in downtown Charleston. The rooms and bathrooms are pretty big and comfortable with all the amenities you could ask for. The ceilings are low in the hallway and the hallways themselves are fairly narrow so it's hard to pull luggage carts and large suitcases through.The King Charles Inn is a great value and conveniently located to everything in downtown Charleston. The staff aims to please and has always made me feel at home. I love the free parking, free wifi, and the rooms are nice and clean. There's an outdoor pool for relaxing with a book and the kids love it! We bring our bikes and ride all over town and bike the bridge to Mt. Pleasant and Patriots Point for helicopter tours. King St is just a block away for the best shopping in Charleston. Marion Square is only a couple of blocks away so make sure you go there on Saturday and/or Sunday for the art and jewelry and food etc that they put out during the summer months. The breakfast is reasonable and quick so it's easy to get fed before heading out on your Charleston adventure. I'm a regular at several hotels but this is the only one where I always find a handwritten card and chocolates from the general manager, Maureen, thanking me for my loyalty. Neither the Four Seasons in Westlake Village, the Fairmont in Santa Monica nor the Trump in Soho or the Waldorf Astoria in Chicago have shown so much appreciation for my countless stays with them over the years. For a more budget minded trip and especially when traveling with children I highly recommend the King Charles Inn!This is the second time I have stayed here and both times were outstanding.  It is in the historical section of the city so you can walk to all things historical.  The general manager gave us her take on tours and restaurants during the late afternoon reception.  I especially like the door man at the hotel.........  A nice touch and I like the safety aspect.  Parking is free.We had booked our hotel reservation for our honeymoon on HotWire and had no idea we'd be staying at such a nice Best Western! Located smackdab in the middle of the historic district, this location is ideal and has access close to everything you want to check out and enjoy. We were so pleased the minute we pulled into check-in. First, complimentary parking underneath the hotel or behind is a huge win. Parking in Charleston is either A) difficult as all get out or B) extremely expensive. Having complimentary parking and the option to come and go as you please is a wonderful amenity. This gives you the freedom to adventure and not worry about breaking the bank with parking. We made it to the front desk and the staff was so friendly. Welcomed us and even gave us a map of must try places. Helped us navigate with a small legend of some things close by. They thanked us for choosing them, coming all the way from Charlotte, and upgraded us to a massive king bed! Huge props! There is also a lounge area up the stairs where they have free cookies and cheese/crackers throughout the day. We made it to our room and not but 10 minutes later, we were greeted by a butler with champagne and chocolates! Happy Honeymoon to us!The rooms and spacious and have incredible amenities. Big bathrooms, tons of furniture, nice TV and a fridge. This is great since we almost always had leftovers. This location feels so safe. Having inside entrances to hotel rooms is a big plus. Absolutely love this location. Affordable and the staff does a fantastic job. Can't wait to stay here again upon our next visit to Chucktown.We were just there from August 2nd until August 5th  2014.  The place is spotless.  The service is excellent.  The people that work there are very nice and are very classy. The cafe that is on the grounds is very good for breakfast or to grab a beer before heading out.  It is also located 2 blocks away from the main part of downtown.  What a great place.Awesome  service as soon as we pulled up! Everyone was very nice from the front desk to the bartender. They even made our reservations for dinner at 82nd queen.We checked into the hotel late Thursday night. The check-in agent told us we had 3 reservations (we had actually booked 2) and she was sorry but they were experiencing a lot of problems with the third party companies who book the rooms and it was best we call Expedia to clear up the confusion....she was not helpful at all.However, the night we checked in we did not see that the building next door to the hotel has recently been demolished. Therefore, at 7 am Friday morning we woke up to a construction crew and their mack trucks moving all around the lot. At 8am on the dot our BEDS BEGAN TO SHAKE because the construction site was drilling large holes into the ground. It was completely unacceptable. The first time we called the front desk they said ""Oh sorry we didn't know they put you on that side"".....didn't know they put us on that side?! Literally the whole side of the hotel was experiencing loud drilling noises. NOT ACCEPTABLE WHEN YOU ARE ON VACATION. Eventually the GM moved our rooms to a different end of the hotel and apologized for the inconvenience. Clearly she has been dealing with this issue for a while now. There were a lot of unhappy guests at this hotel looking for room changes after the drilling began at 8am. I suggest before you ever book a room at this hotel, make sure the construction on the lot next door has been completed.Wife and I stayed here, and this is the BEST we have stayed in with the Best Western Hotels. The Manager and staff are will trained....LOVED THIS PLACE...!!Nice, modern hotel, recently revamped from the look of it, in a great location on the peninsula. Pricey for us, but suspect you can get better rates in advance. Parking is included in the price. Great desk staff - they were really lovely and helpful.Exceeded our expectations! Great service and amenities, perfect location for walking anywhere in the historic district. We will stay here again!Great place to stay, can walk Charleston's historic district, shop on King St and at the Market, and dine casual or fancy.  Room was beautiful, clean and staff friendly.I was very disappointed with our stay here.  I read lots of glowing reviews before booking two months ahead, when I could have booked virtually anywhere in the city, and requested one of the highly recommended rooms with a balcony.   Upon arriving, we discovered that the balcony looked out over the interior parking garage of this hotel.  What a joke - incredibly misleading about the balcony and view.  When I complained about this to the general manager, all I got was an apology saying ""I'm sorry it was not described properly on our website.""  Buyer beware!We arrived at cocktail hour and it felt like we were staying at a nursing home. Seriously, everyone was over 60. Yes, I realize it's Best Western. But still. The room was small and awkwardly located. It was clean and nice enough. I did NOT appreciate housekeeping calling at 9:49am to see if we wanted our room serviced--not cool, Best Western. I'm on Vacation! And I'm not 60 so don't wake me up to give me towels on YOUR schedule.Very nice hotel, great location. Close to some great bars and restaurants, the Battery and shopping on King St.The staff was friendly and it was in a great location for exploring Charleston on foot. The facilities were well kept and clean but a bit confusing, since there was no easy way to get to the room from the lobby. This may be due to the architectural restrictions in Charleston. Also, the rooms were over decorated to the point that it limited usable space within the room. Maybe due to age, the walls between rooms were not good at isolating neighboring sounds, but this was not a big deal for our stay.We were unable to book a room with a balcony, but worth checking out in the future.Here's an update on the Best Western - King Charles Inn as of May 2010, post renovation. This is still the best Best Western to which we've ever been. Indeed, it doesn't even seem like a standard Best Western but rather like a  three star hotel that is, in addition, very central to all the restaurants and attractions of historic downtown Charleston.Highlights of our experience at the King Charles included: General cleanliness and neutral to nice smells throughout the hotel; excellent shower fixtures and granite surfaces in the bathroom and in the small writing area; an excellent balcony with two rocking chairs; plenty of soft, quality towels; and a Pacific Coast down comforter on the comfortable king-sized bed. The staff at the King Charles was 100% pro: The bell hop had some really good advice regarding restaurants and live music venues; and our maids were really smiley and pleasant.  The King Charles has a small but meticulously kept pool, a lovely breakfast room, and a nice little bar area and, best of all, its own parking lot right under the hotel which comes with the price of your room. The parking is a real plus considering that many of the other snobbier hotels in town charge you $15/night to park your car, parking on the street in Charleston is all but impossible and the ""boot"" is liberally used. Guests should be aware that if the lot right under the hotel is full, there is an ""overflow"" lot  right across Meeting Street.We will most definitely stay at the King Charles the next time we are in Charleston, may it be soon! It is a wonderful oasis at a very friendly price.This hotel is conveniently located on Meeting street, just on the north side of all the shops and restaurants.  We got a great rate and decided to give it a shot.The hotel has a very upscale feel, especially for a Best Western - likely the result of their recent renovation.  The front desk staff were very courteous and helpful with suggestions on local restuarants and activities.  We had no problems with parking or check-in.The rooms are well-decorated and comfortable, if on the small side.  I think they have about the smallest bathrooms allowed by OSHA!  But overall we were very pleased with the rooms.Overall, a great location for an overnighter or a two-night stay, but if you're looking for a room to spend more time in these may be a little too cramped.  We totally enjoyed it for what it was, however!Rooms are way small, air conditioner ran all night, walls are paper thin and they charge you for everything (even though their website makes it sound as if breakfast is included).  No thanks.","The company photos here on Yelp are pretty accurate. This is probably the nicest Best Western I have ever been in. The rooms are very upscale and the hotel just looks nice. It fits in with the neighborhood. The location is great. Charleston isn't the kind of city you want to drive around...you should walk it. You could pick almost any street and you'll find something historic and interesting on a walk. The King Charles Inn is situated smack in the middle of some really nice walking streets. Lots of popular restaurants are nearby.  For the negatives, I couldn't find many but these are the ones that stood out: Our bed had nice sheets and pillows but one of the two beds in our room sagged in the middle. We didn't use it much but the TV had only 12 channels, which seemed odd in this modern world.  Parking was tight but there was ample overflow. The parking garage, which is under the hotel, always seemed full and I think that's because everyone did like us and parked one day and didn't move their cars until check out. You don't need to in this location. The pool was small but situated in a cute courtyard that most of the time seemed private.I would stay at this hotel again, though probably not in hot, sticky July.Very nice hotel! Im not a fan of Best Westerns in general but this is definitely a step above any Best Western and super convenient location. Stay here and walk the block to Hyman's Seafood...cant beat either one in downtown Charleston!From the rooms to service the hotel is top notch. You will not find better. The staff is top notch, the rooms are modern and clean, and you are within easy walk to most of Charleston's top sites. You won't regret this choice. We always stay here when in town.Clean, affordable, and excellent location to all the sites we wanted to see.We were not able to check in early, but they took our bags for us and let us park there while we were looking around.  Staff was very friendly.  Free coffee.  The only issue was the parking - if you left after like 7pm good luck finding a spot upon your return.This hotel is in a great location, so close to everything: the shops on King, the open Market st shops, the aquarium, half a block from Jestine's and Fig... The staff was really friendly and the room was spacious. Comfortable King bed and good pillows! Very clean, too, I am paranoid about hotel cleanliness.  Only complaints: loud ( but very cold) a/c, weird low ceiling hallways and balcony overlooked the parking lot. Pool is comically tiny. The room was very nice though and the location really couldn't be better.  The hotel is very difficult to navigate, like 3-4 buildings cobbled together, it was very difficult to get from our room to the front desk, we usually just walked through the parking lot.This is is a nice hotel that has been recently remodeled. The price was very reasonable for the location which is in the heart of the historic district. The rooms have internet and the business area has computers with internet access. They have an in house bar for early evening drinks. Parking is free in a secure lot.Great stay at the King Charles Inn! The location is perfect, placed just steps away from the famous Jestine's kitchen, city Market, Wine bars, Jazz bars, and historic sites galore! We had a perfect vacation and wonderful accommodations with this hotel. The value was incredible, the staff were beyond friendly, the room was so spacious and clean! We wouldn't stay anywhere else upon a return trip!This hotel is near most of the attractions (market, shopping, Restaurants). The pool area is nice and relaxing. The staff is friendly. In the lobby they offer happy hour specials which includes a complimentary fruit and cheeses tray. I will return to this hotel on my next visit. The hotel had ths the best soap, oatmeal. The rooms had granite counter tops. Also, there was complimentary tea and coffee avaible in the lobby.Nice hotel, with clean updated rooms a bit on the small side.  Parking is a bit limited and spaces are a bit tight.  Conveniently located, easy to walk to restaurants from here.  Helpful staff.  I would stay here again.Stayed here with some girlfriends for a bachelorette weekend and was delighted with the hotel!  The rooms were clean, nicely decorated and spacious enough for our needs.  The pool, while small, was sufficient, with a nice lounge area with tables.  They had a daily happy hour with drink specials and a fruit and cheese platter, which was satisfied our mid-afternoon snacking needs.  They also had free coffee and iced water- two staples for late nights and the summer Charleston heat!  The location was great as everything we needed was in walking distance.  The only negative was that our bathtub was slow to drain.  Other than that, the price was great and everyone commented that this was the best Best Western they'd ever stayed in!Had read the reviews and found this inn to be rated very well. I have to agree.  The rooms had poster beds with comfortable mattresses and pillows and stark white bedding that not only lent to a light and airy room, but also to the cleanliness of the room.  The King Charles Inn is conveniently located to everything downtown in the heart of the historic district - the City Market is only a block and a half away and it's centrally located so that you can walk to most anywhere or hop the free bus that runs throughout the downtown area.  We never used the bus as we had rented a car, which is nice to have if you plan on visiting any of the plantations or anything outside of the downtown area.  Free parking at the hotel was a nice bonus that we took advantage of for the duration of our stay,  The staff is very friendly and accommodating and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit Charleston who wants to stay downtown without breaking the bank.I love this hotel. We stayed here back in June for a weekend.  Its within walking distance of the straw markets and the shopping on King street. We just parked the car, which is free and walked around. We did not try the breakfast because there is so much great food in Charleston anyway. We did get in the pool though, which is small but cute and deep.  This is a nice place and the staff are friendly. I would not stay anywhere else in Charleston.The King Charles Inn is under renovation currently, but we just stayed in one of their renovated rooms.  Nicely decorated, comfy beds, wonderful pillows, and the bathroom was particularly nice and well-appointed.  The service was always perfect and friendly, the pool is lovely and there is a nice seating area just above it and outside the bar where weary parents can have a glass of wine after the kids are in bed (thank you long-range baby monitor).  Parking is free and the hotel was generous with guest passes although that may change once all the rooms are available and extra spaces are less plentiful.The breakfast looked and smelled awesome, but we were meeting family and they wanted to eat elsewhere.  Woe is me, we ended up at IHOP.The location is fantastic as well.  I thought the rates were very reasonable for the level of service and the quality of the rooms.  The website had some excellent deals, I would definitely stay here again.When we arrived for a weekend trip, we were pleased with the location of the hotel and what appeared to be a nice room. The check-in staff were friendly and accommodating. I woke up after the first night feeling itchy. My husband read that a sign of bed bugs is tiny blood spots on the sheets, so he inspected the bed and found about 10 tiny spots on my side. When we removed the sheets we found a tiny black bug that appeared to be dead. We called the front desk and a bellman came and picked up the bug and looked at it. We asked to be moved so we could shower. The manager came up and said she couldn't find any bugs and asked to see the bites. I didn't want to pull down my pants to show them. She said she had been trained extensively in bed bugs and the bites don't itch and the bugs are clear. A quick look at WebMD disproves both statements. We were told two people had just checked out and a new room would be available soon. We went to eat breakfast and checked back. No room, but they promised to call as soon as one was ready. We ventured out in 30 degree weather to a coffee shop to wait. After another 90 minutes, we called and were told housekeeping was checking on rooms. After 20 minutes, we walked back and the front desk staff scrambled and eventually found a room -- more than three hours after our initial call. The manager was rude and acted as if we were being deceitful. We stayed the second night without issue. The next morning my husband visited the manager before showed her cell phone pictures of the bites on my legs. She said pest control didn't find any bugs. He got very upset with her and she was exceediny was rude to him. Later, I asked to see her and told her that while I'm certain there are people who scam hotels, we are not those people. We never asked for anything except a different room and it took three hours to get it. I told her I didn't appreciate her questioning my credibility. She said that when she came to our room I had said I didn't have any bites and that I said I was being a ""hypochondriac."" What I had actually said was that I was itching all over and that after finding the bug and the blood, some of the itching could be ""psychosomatic."" Big difference. She was inexcusably rude and defensive when all we wanted was a clean room and a sincere apology. I don't blame them for the bugs. That can happen at the nicest hotels. I do blame them for treating us like criminals and liars.Certainly the nicest Best Western I've ever stayed at.  Newly remolded, clean and well appointed decoration.  Ideal location, friendly staff, comfy beds, and reasonably valued for the price during spring season.  The breakfast option is convenient, but nothing to write home about.  Although we didn't use it, the pool was small, but nice with plenty of chaises for sunbathing.  We did enjoy the wireless, room patio, and the full happy hour bar.  Really good choice to meet many needs.i've been known to choose a crappy hotel or three (hey, it was before yelp, alright?), but this centrally located best western actually worked very well for us!the room was spacious and clean, the price was reasonable, there was free wi-fi, and service was very friendly!  i would definitely stay here again if in the area!note: booking through their website lead to best prices!This was our first trip to Charleston. The King Charles is clean, nicely decorated in old world style. It's located right in middle of downtown Charleston &amp; if you're not looking for it you will miss it. We booked here via their online website because my husband's employer gets a discount &amp; because the website description made the Inn sound spacious, but when we arrived it was anything but that. Pictures on website are deceiving making the hotel &amp; rooms look spacious, its not. If you get a room w/ a balcony, you get a view of the parking garage. Pool is about the size of two large hot tubs. The Deluxe Double room was too small for 3 adults on tiny full-sized beds. When I told management the room was too small, they offered to upgrade us to their King Deluxe for no extra charge, but then our 18-year-old son would have to sleep on a cot! We said no thanks &amp; just made do with our room, spending most of our time out of it. Never tried room service or hotel restaurant as they were too expensive. They do have free parking in their garage which was a plus. But if you leave and return in the evening be prepared to park in their overflow lot across the street. If you like small &amp; cramped spaces then this is the place for you. In fact, this describes downtown Charleston. You will need a Mini Cooper to navigate it! For goodness sake (&amp; your vehicles paint job) don't come here in a SUV!! You can walk everywhere to shopping &amp; restaurants, but if you come in summer prepare to sweat profusely on your walk-about in the humidity.nice hotel, not alot of parking under the hotel, but never had a problem since they had extra across the street. Pool was a little small, but had great jazz playing, nice flowers and nice loungers. Really pretty sitting area with fountian and ice water next to the pool. Great location, so we could walk to everything. Our refrigerator broke right after we arrived, and they fixed it as soon as we called to report it. We were on the 3rd floor, and it could get really noisy since our room overlooked the street. We had brought a fan which drowned out most of the noise, so had no problems sleeping.Great hotel! The local is ideal for seeing the sites on the Charleston Peninsula. The service was fantastic, including the front desk staff and door men. The property is very cute and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Access to a nice gym around the corner is complimentary, always a bonus. I was overall very happy with King Charles and if I go back to Charleston I will stay there again.",,"['great', 'rate', 'king', 'inn', 'plus', 'free', 'parking', 'back', 'pass', 'booking', 'idea',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/charleston-plaza-hotel-north-charleston-2,Charleston Plaza Hotel,2.0,$$,23,"Old hotel but I read online that they will be undergoing renovations soon.  The lobby is very nice and so is the bar/restaurant.  Now onto the room: I was on the business floor and the room was decent, at best.  The view was terrible but I wasn't there for the views so I didn't really care.  The AC worked but I was not able to control it and the AC is ridiculously loud.  The bed was comfortable but the shower is terrible!!  The water wouldn't drain at all and it was disgusting.  They were nice enough to let me do late checkout till 2PM.  The hallways smelled like cigarettes.  The overall experience can be improved if they work on the little things.My experience once again seems to differ from the main stream. I found this hotel to be most suitable in every way, from the gracious front desk personnel, a  very large clean comfortable contemporary room and bathroom to the very courteous airport shuttle divers. If you decide to stay longer than an overnight then you should have a rental car as downtown Charleston and/or MT Pleasant is a 15 to 20 minute drive. There are some interesting things to do in North Charleston but that too would require a car. If I needed to stay near the Charleston Airport in the future, I would not hesitate to stay at the Charleston Plaza as it is only an 8 minute shuttle ride to the airport.Yeah, as another Yelper commented, the lobby area is nice, but the rooms are dirty and outdated.  And although every employee I talked to was very friendly, our room was unacceptable.  I'm not sure what kind of view I was expecting at an airport hotel, but all we could see from our window was air conditioner equipment.The bathroom sink was running (not dripping) the entire time we were there.  At one point, it was filling an 8oz cup in just over 5 seconds.  The first night, when I tried to shut the faucet off, the handle came off in my hand.  We notified the front desk, and they promised to have it fixed.  When we got back to the room, the handle had been screwed back onto the faucet.  However, the faucet was still running, and turning the handle wouldn't change the water temperature.  Our only choice was hot.  It was comfortable enough for hand washing, but way too hot for teeth brushing or drinking, and not hot enough for shaving.  And on our last night there, the handle came off in my hand, AGAIN!The shower curtain was moldy, and it stank.   After our room had been cleaned, I had to wander the halls looking for someone with a cleaning cart in order to get coffee and toilet paper.  And there was exactly one available electric outlet in the room for charging our phones and computers.This is the most pathetic hotel ever and it  is a joke to all hotels out of the city of Charleston. Poor hospitality, poor cleanliness, poor stablishment,poor use as a hotel.Do not come here! The hotel has a beautiful lobby and bar area. As for the rooms, they are very outdated and extremely dirty! The lamp doesn't work. The sheets are stained. See the photos!Recently rebranded as the 'Charleston Plaza Hotel', this comfortable property is a short drive from the airport, and just 15 minutes from the historic district. We scored a $75 rate on Priceline when planning a last-minute family getaway on Memorial Day weekend, and the room was worth just about that.The front-desk service was slow but adequate, and our two-room suite was spacious and clean. The property shows some wear and tear, but we couldn't find anything glaringly wrong. Then again, I was a little afraid to look too closely. The biggest negative was that the TV in the living area wouldn't work. This was a real bummer for our two kids, but helped get us out the door a lot more quickly, so I really can't complain. The king-sized bed was a lot more comfortable that I expected, and the shower was hot. While definitely not the sort of place I'd book for a romantic weekend in Charleston, it did the trick for a quick family weekend away.I didn't have high expectations given the rates we paid but the hotel was just fine.  Lobby looks good but rooms are out dated and need an upgrade.  Beds are not very comfortable either.  Didn't get a chance to use the pool but it looked nice.  Checkin can be friendlier as well.  Overall worth 100$ a night.Where do I begin? When you arrive it looks great! Just wait until you get in your room. When we first got in our room and were checking everything out we found dirty towels hanging over the shower rod. Not to mention the moldiness of the tub. It was so gross. Not acceptable at all. The corners in the bathroom were yellowed and looked like they had been urinated in. The carpet in the room was not clean due to finding several what looked like some sort of gummy candies on the floor. There were no trashbags in the trash cans,which were dirty as well. We had a terrible time falling asleep due to the pool being open until 11pm and children playing and screaming until then. I would defintely not recommend this hotel!Staff is really nice, the room is very clean and the bed was so comfortable. It's an older hotel so it's not perfect but my room was great. I've stayed in many hotels in the area and this is the best deal I've found. I will definitely be staying here again as my best friend only lives 5 minutes away.Very comfortable hotel with good air conditioning and soft beds. This is your average run of the mill hotel that has changed names over the years. I would not pay over 100.00 to stay here, good for one night as it is place to hang your head for the night. Located in North Charleston which has Holy City and Coast Brewery down the road not to mentioned EVO and The Brew Cellar a few of my favorite eateries and breweries when I'm in chuck town.CLOTHING STOLEN BY STAFF - Management would not help""STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL! My college age daughter stayed at this hotel July 2, 2015 through July 5, 2015. It was a horrible experience. She and her girlfriend left a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door, and the cleaning staff came in anyway. When they returned from their outing on Saturday, she realized her expensive shorts were stolen. The cleaning staff had moved her bag and other belongings off of the bed, but the shorts were gone. She had just worn them that morning, so she knew she had not misplaced them. When she told the front desk about what happened, they told her to fill out a report for ""Lost and Found."" I thought that was an ingenious way of covering up the incident.When my daughter returned to Atlanta, her dad called the hotel and spoke to the manager. She pays for her own clothes and expenses, so this was a big deal for her. He was not interested in helping us because he said that he has never had a problem with stealing before. This was very unprofessional of him to assume that my daughter was lying. We believe that the staff is very smart to steal one item at a time. Most people would assume that they mistakenly left their item at the hotel instead of assuming that it was stolen.As far as the quality of the hotel is concerned, it was WAY BELOW AVERAGE. My daughter said it smelled like mildew and the air conditioner was not operating properly.The hotel customer service was good. However, the rooms were not that great. The floors were damp and wet. The bath tub had little mold. The corners of the room was dusty. It only get 2 stars because we had a family reunion.Looks great in the lobby and from the outside. The rooms are a little outdated. The towels need replacing and the housekeepers could do a little better job. Not terrible for a business weekend, but I wouldn't recommend it for a couples weekend getaway in Charlestown. I'll stick to the larger chain hotels from now on.Many of the recent comments left by other folks (dirty, old, non-vacuumed and stained carpets, old furniture, etc) are entirely accurate, so I would not go over them again. To top those all off, my husband was extensively bitten by bed bugs during the first night of our stay. The front desk associate moved us to a room on the business level (cleaner, fresher than the first one, but not by much), yet he did not seem surprised at all to hear my complaints. Helpfulness and politeness don't really help in that case, given that we now have to disinfect all of our luggage from the trip. Another think that was terrible - the bathroom in the original room was rusty and looked very dirty. The business level one was slightly better, but not great either. Would not recommend this place at all.Totally surprised and wow.The Innplace Hotel is a definite eye opener when I drove up to the property after a good day sightseeing in downtown Charleston. I found Innplace on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and saw the hotel photos there and on the official hotel website. Often enough, you tend not to believe the hotel photos, but not this time. This property was pretty amazing. Very clean and bright. Immaculate and nothing short of glimmering and sparkly, to turn a phrase. I would like to say that this place mirrors higher end hotel brands like Marriott and Sheraton. And just maybe, dare I say, Westin too? It was a bit too perfect, but I didn't mind at all. The lobby was gorgeous and the property was nice, with many parking spaces for guests.The Innplace hotel - Charleston Airport is located near the Charleston regional airport, as the name implies. Right off the I-26, depending on which way you are coming from, but it was nice that it was right off the interstate when driving from downtown Charleston. I was here for just a night (Sunday, 2/16/2014) before driving back to Columbia, SC to fly out back to home. This was indeed a great choice I made. The check in process was very smooth and Brian was very nice. He even asked me about my marathon finisher's medal I was wearing. To which I replied, Myrtle Beach, which I ran yesterday. He told me he does various shorter events, but aims to do longer ones in the future. I received room #341, which was a King bed, that I booked for. It was great. Almost like a Sheraton in comfort and spaciousness. Definitely borderline luxury, but without the luxury price for sure. :) I was definitely happy.Among the room amenities, the big screen tv, a business desk with a chair, and a coffee maker. Too bad that there wasn't a microwave or a mini fridge, but its cool. There was ice maker machine on my floor, as well as vending machines as well. A little bit of style, but with a bit of basic necessities as well. There was room service options for breakfast here, but it was definitely pricy. I ended up driving back to Columbia airport and picked up McDonald's on the way for breakfast. Ha. Way cheaper! The bed was definitely comfortable. Must've gotten 7 blissful hours of sleep before the 1 1/2 hour drive back to Columbia, but it was worth the $80/night price tag. While I didn't use any other in house amenity, having a nice bed to lay my head and a quality stay is all I need. No need for extra comfort.The room was clean and very comfortable, so definitely no complaints about that. The check out process was okay. I had to wait till the hotel lobby phone rang and someone from the back came out to answer it. I had stood at the counter for a good 10 minutes and said hello, but nobody came out. It's okay though. The $80/night price tag is certainly a steal, so you may want to hang out here when your travels come through Charleston, South Carolina. Yes, definitely recommended for your accommodations. Best place to stay while on a budget, although you may need to check prices before booking. I probably just got lucky or it may be the low season (February).Support local!AQuiet, convenient, comfortable at a good price.  Great location for anyone with a car needing to access both downtown and the airport.  Not the right place if you want activities right outside your door - you're near a freeway. The lobby is nice but the rooms could use an update - especially the bathrooms. The shower drained slow and the toilet was a finicky flusher. Carpet had signs of wear and tear, plus many marks all over the walls.  Nothing outright bad, it just shows signs of long term repeated use. Would be nicer if they had breakfast or mini refrigerators so you could bring your own. Only complaint was that maintenance knocked on our door and woke us up at 7am to fixed a clogged toilet - but it wasn't ours, they got the wrong room. And we even had the Do Not Disturb sign up, so that was frustrating. If you have a larger budget and want more updated room with breakfast, check out other options. If you're on a smaller budget, want a nice enough place and don't need breakfast - this is your spot! Bonus: the lobby is nice and there's an indoor/outdoor pool.After reading some previous reviews Hotel is slot nicer than I expected! Would have gotten 5 stars if there was a fridge in the room, ($15 rental fee) and breakfast was included with stay. Ok I am rerating my stay. We were here for 3 days and not once did housekeeping come in to service our room. We asked 3 times on the last day by calling and even visiting the front desk for our room to be serviced. Each time we were told it would be taken care of but never was. Finally when we came in late on the last night of our stay and our room still hadn't been cleaned, the front desk offered to move us to another room. That meant we had to pack up everything, and get situated in a new room when we already had to leave at 6am the following morning.Dont let the lobby and pool area fool you.Updating review after spending a couple nights here.  PRO: Housekeeping was wonderful, delivered a second iron quickly when I had trouble with the first. (My fault, not theirs---it worked after delivery of second one of course).  Room was spotless, came home each day to fresh towels, beds made well, trash emptied and bathroom clean--thanks.Hotel restaurant food very good for breakfast and dinner--not here for lunch.CON Had a slow draining toilet and some confusion when I called downstairs at 4 am as to when they would deliver my requested plunger.  Delivered after 6 am and they insisted on doing the work, so that was appreciated. View from our room is of top of first floor roof, complete with air conditioning units and other industrial units. But it's fine with us as we are not here for the view out of our room.The pictures from <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> were deceiving. The lightbulb in the lamp between the beds was broken. The sheets were not 100% clean they had stains on them. When we asked for new sheets those sheets were the same as the sheets prior. The indoor pool stated that it was heated and it was not. If you have a baby bring your own pack and play or crib or you need to bring your own bumper if you're using their crib. Their crib is all metal frame. Don't plan on hot water for your showers, it's cold and if you're very patient possibly lukewarm. The overall look of the hotel looks like it is falling apart.I just held a Navy reunion at the Charleston Plaza Hotel in June. BEWARE! I realize they are going to renovate in Dec, but!! The rooms are sort of clean, but in dreadful shape...furniture beat-up, draperies askew, furniture &amp; floors not very clean, rooms not refreshed some days, AND they tried to cheat me. I signed a contract for certain things. At the time of the reunion they tried to put us in a tiny banquet room...not what I signed for, said they did not have certain items for my use that they stated would be available in the contract &amp; were not pleased when I demanded what I'd been promised. (Customer service skills are very lacking in all levels.) Today I discover they charged my credit card $150.00 for things I never used, saw or charged!! They say it was for incidentals &amp; since I had none, that $150.00 was deleted from the bill I got at the end of my stay...BUT...was then sent to my credit card company. (My credit card company is now investigating as they said they do not understand what this hotel is trying to pull. ) Don't stay there if you can avoid it!","This hotel was horrible!! It was dirty, falling apart (our bathroom ceiling was collapsing over the shower), the corner wall in the bedroom area was rotting, the AC didn't work well for two days and we asked for a change or fixing it. They fixed it, then our keys didn't work. They reset the keys and upon checking out, they said, ""didn't you move to a more expensive room?"". We said no, as they never informed us of it. ""Oh, ha, ha, here are the keys that should have been given to you."" So, it is a mess from the building condition to the staff and management. If we had not been part of a reunion, we would have moved out after the first night!!This is certainly not a 3-star as advertised on Priceline.  You do get what you pay for.  I paid $95 for the room, glad I did not pay more.  It was moderately clean and very old. Wall paper hanging in corners from the wall and tile grout crumbling and falling off.   The sheets appeared to be clean.  The baseboards were filthy and our towels were not replaced for 3 days.  When we asked the lady with the cart in the hallway, the only response we got was ""no intiendo.""  How convenient!Although this property has very nice common area amenities (i.e. lobby and pool) the rooms have a little to be desired.  The room that I was in had a leak above in the bathroom, at least I assume, as the drywall ceiling was sagging and had a hole in it.  I felt the ceiling and it was wet.  The pictures of the rooms make them look much bigger than they really are.  If you are just staying overnight and going to the airport it is a good deal but I wouldn't stay there for more than a night.",,,,"['old', 'hotel', 'read', 'undergoing', 'renovations', 'soon',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-charleston-waterfront-charleston-2,Courtyard Charleston Waterfront,3.0,$$,35,"Marriott is quickly becoming my preferred hotel brand due in part to experiences at their affordable Courtyard branded locations. This stay was another solid experience. We came to Charleston for the night and when researching hotels this location came up at about half the cost of a downtown hotel despite being a little over a mile away from the French Quarter. While the weather held steady on Saturday we found it was quite an easy walk into town. When the rain came later that night the uber back to the hotel was about $7. The hotel has a great location for the price. The room we stayed in was a bit small but clean and 2 complimentary water bottles and chocolates were provided. I was just happy they let us check in 4 hours early! We also went to the bar before heading out and the bartender was friendly and the happy hour pricing was very happy indeed. They have a huge outdoor verandah that I imagine is great for relaxing with some wine when the weather is warmer.The only downsides were this - there was construction going on during our visit which meant getting lost trying to find the functional elevator and the lights were out in the hallway when we first went to our room. The second and cautionary piece is that the water in the shower and sink will go from freezing to burning in just a few seconds so be careful!I was treated like a queen at the Starbucks this morning. When my food was a little slow, they brought out a complimentary muffin for me. A couple of the staff came over multiple times to check on me at breakfast. They honestly seemed like they cared so much--very refreshing! The rooms were so comfortable, with an amazing shower. I will definitely be staying here again!Overall, it was an ok experience. It was pretty cheap compared to the other hotels in the area. The rooms were small and mediocre, but thats what you get for this price. The ""waterview"" thet we were supposed to get from our hotel window wasn't really a water view, more like a patio view. The shuttle service they provided was pretty inconvenient, as it didn't come that often and was cramped. It also broke down at one point ans we had to take a taxi instead. Probably the biggest thing for me was the fact that they didn't clean the rooms! They replaced the towels once, but they didn't make the beds despite us leaving the sign down. They then left out an envelope for us to put a tip in which was pretty rude.Absolutely the worst customer service of my life. They refused to give us another room or upgrade us. We are gold members of the hotel chain. Then when my father left I sat on a bench to wait for a family member who had hone to the bathroom, the people at the front desk laughed at my father. They said that he shouldnt be acting like that, him just being a gold member and not platnium. We walked across the parking lot to the Hilton who gave us the upgraded rooms for $70 less on each.Beautiful view, nice enough room--nothing fancy. 1.5 miles to downtown is walkable, provided you have the time to burn. The issues: one elevator broken all 4 days, the other incredibly slow. We were near the elevator on 2nd floor and it took 8-10 minutes on average to get out of the hotel. This is really ridiculous if not also unsafe. I used uber frequently and they'd be waiting and waiting downstairs even though I ordered the car service as I was walking out my door.Our sink was also completely clogged. Running the water more than 30 seconds brought the level to near-flood. Try washing your face when you can barely speed-wash your hands. Tried to check out fitness center--equipment broken or not well-maintained. Can't imagine it's extremely popular so don't understand the level of wear &amp; tear. They offer a ""shuttle service"" to the waterfront from the hotel. Roughly it runs every 30 mins. The issue? It's $6. Is this a joke?!?! My uber was $7 (tip included). That's me hiring a private car service, on my own time, which takes me door to door, with only a few moments notice--$1 more than sharing a rickety van with 6 strangers??? Either make it free or get rid of it.Place had great views for the sunset right from the deck and pool area. There is also a hot tub and great size pool that over looks the yachts and boats on water.Our romantic anniversary weekend consisted of finding out we slept on BLOODY SHEETS!!! 1) We checked in on Thursday and found our tub and sink were plugged.  While we were at a wedding they unplugged the tub but not the sink.  2) We returned incredibly late and went straight to sleep.  We woke up in the morning to my boyfriend sleeping on a dirty pillow.3) Laying in bed I looked over and found BLOOD on the bed.  I confirmed it was not from either of us and disgustingly realized, I had slept on someone else blood ALL NIGHT!!! Worse part was it was in the mid section, there were two large spots, it was more than obviously menstrual blood.4) The hotel somehow disengaged our keys so I was locked out of my room at 6am.  Had to go to the lobby and request another.  The receptionist just asked for my room# and tossed the key at me like I had bothered her.  Not even an acknowledgment of their mistake.5) When I called the manager regarding the blood, he took 3 HOURS, to return my call.6) When the manager did call back, he said, ""I listened to my voicemail. Come down to the front desk, we have vouchers for a free night."" No acknowledgment of the situation, apology or even status of if they were going to send someone up to clean the room.7) Returned to the room that night to find ZERO parking spots in the garage or connected lots.  Had to park in check-in parking.8) All we asked of the manager was to have the room clean to ""check-in"" standards.  Returned to our room to find pubic hair on the toilet seat and outer wall of the bath tub.  Also, dirt on the floor of tub where the maid had stepped in the tub to access the interior towel rack.9) Despite trying to bribe us to go away with offers of free hotels nights and breakfast, even on check out, nothing was received or acknowledged.  10) Still 3 days after check out we have still to receive the call we requested Friday night from management.  We did call corporate.  They were receptive and warm.  However, despite ruining our 2 night anniversary weekend getaway, we have received 10,000 points.  That sounds like alot till you realize a night in a normal average room is 30,000 a night.  Incredibly disappointing.  Hotel has tremendous potential.  Accidents happen, every hotel is going to have a blunder but to have a mistake of bloody sheets and not even take 30 seconds to come to the room or listen to what happened was disgraceful. Even after a full phone call, I still had to ask the manager if he was going to send someone up to clean up the blood since he had lacked even addressing the main issue.Hopefully others continue to have better stays than this awful experience. At least, stays that require management attention, they may just leave as disappointed as us.We have been staying here about once a year or so for the past 7 years.  It used to be a bit better than its current state. Slowest elevators on earth, carpeting worn, drain in bathroom sink about as slow as the elevator. Breakfast - everything tasted like grease.  I'm not a vegetarian but noted that no offerings there except fruit/cereal.  I'm not a coffee drinker and good thing I brought my own tea as the tea selection was limited to green tea or Lipton's. The exercise room was acceptable. Staff pleasant but looks like the ownership isn't paying attention. Guess if you sell out every night you don't have to.The views are great.  The staff has been wonderful.  I had issues getting my work laptop online and they were very helpful.  Everything is very clean.  The property hasn't been remodeled to the Courtyard Bistro type lobby but the waterfront patio is great.Dirty and in dire need of a major renovation. Mildew and mold everywhere...small rooms - terrible bathrooms...Not comparible to other hotels in the chain..Would definitely reccommend another hotel until they clean it up. Only stayed here because work booked me here!Beware balcony doors! I was staying by myself and shut the door behind me and the security bar fell locking me out on the balcony.I'm torn between a 3 star and 4 star review. Here's why.When we arrived on a Sunday afternoon, there was a busload of what looked like spring breakers from a local high school or college. They were everywhere. They were drunk. They were pushing past me, my pregnant wife, and my son in a stroller. They thought we were different people and had conversations with us. It was a crazy nut house.The poor front desk folks seems unaffected by everything going on around them. When we showed up, they didn't seem to care that it was our first time visiting and we'd just spent 5 straight hours in a car with a screaming kid. They handed us our keys and said no more.We upgraded our room to overlook the pool. This was crucial because our baby monitor reached the pool, so we could hang out outside while little one slept in the room.The hotel provided a pack and play for our one-year-old, which was pretty great. They didn't bother setting it up in the room, but no problems there. The pack and play was obviously used, had a few stains on it. Again, no problems.Our room had a mini fridge and a microwave, both of which were sufficient. The shower was standard, the size of the room was standard, everything was fine. We tried to order dinner at their restaurant on the main floor, but I think they're only open for breakfast, which I guess makes sense in Charleston.I really liked the main outdoor area with rocking chairs that overlooked the pool and marina. Probably one of the better hotel views in Charleston.Oh yeah, they have a policy not to change the sheets until 3 days in to your stay. But we asked if they could change them 2 days in, and they did it, no questions asked.Staying here and while the staff is nice, they are woefully understaffed for the number of people they have staying here.  The place is dirty, the carpet in the hallway hasn't been vacuumed in 3 days.  The place is worn and no one seems to be overseeing anything.  Good breakfast, rooms ok, we didn't get a view so what's the point? beds ok, towels are average, ...not sure I'd stay here again.Was staying downtown for a quick getaway and booked the first place I could using Marriott reward points. I lucked out for sure. The staff was great, room was clean, and the best part was the steaming hot outdoor jacuzzi - in December!!!Only drawback was the parking and the speed of the elevators. The garage parking is a bit limited. I went down to grab some coffee in the morning. When I tried to go back up, I waited at least 10 minutes for the elevator to come. Overall, great place.  The views of the marina and river are beautiful.We recently stayed at the hotel and had a pretty pleasant experience.  We switched rooms the second day (they moved our items for us while we were out) to a room with a view of the marina.  Sunsets were beautiful.We took advantage of the hot tub while the sun was setting, again, very pretty.Spent some time down at the bar in the evening.  Shannon was great and very friendly.  Knowing that the hotel usually holds wedding parties, one suggestion would be to plan to keep the bar open a little later to accommodate the flow of people returning to the hotel after an event.I would suggest having some dining options available such as room service, as there is no restaurants within walking distance.For the price( 300.00 plus) I was disappointed...room was fairly clean...but so over priced it made me laugh... location location so they say...whew... I have experience far better way more humble...go to Vacation Rentals by Owner...Oh my stars what fun awesome priced deals!!! I use this site always and have never gotten a bad experience!Okay hotel, abysmal customer service.I was overcharged for my stay. I booked through a third party who collected the money upfront. The hotel also charged me when I checked in on my incidental credit card- which I never would have known if I didn't check my credit card bill (the charge isn't on my receipt). The real kicker is when I tried to call them, the phone continually rang busy. So much for being able to rectify the situation. What kind of hotel doesn't have a working phone, or the ability to appropriately charge their customers for their stay?Marriott customer service emailed them on my behalf, but I don't count on getting a response.  Other than this epic fail in customer service, my stay was fine. The location is inconvenient, but the hotel is more reasonably priced than comparable hotels downtown.  However, based on this current headache and time-suck, I would most definitely NOT recommend staying here- you'll enjoy your stay but regret it afterward.Overall, its a nice Courtyard. Rooms have been upgraded to new Marriott Courtyard style, with flat screens. Property is nicer than your typical Courtyard with the courtyard area facing the waterfront where you can hangout. I don't believe breakfast should be $10+ per person at these type properties, so we skipped that. Its close enough to the real downtown Charleston by car or hotel bus, so location is fine. My only real issue was the internet access was kinda slow, and when you travel for work, fast internet is sometimes more important than a comfy bed.It may be slightly outside of downtown but beautiful.  Painted a beautiful yellow with white trim.  Overlooks the river and yachts.  They have a wonderful breakfast.  When I was there it was not free but you got so much for so little.  So, we filled up everyday thinking we would skip lunch.  We did t.  We ate way too much because of the great food in the city.The decorations were nice and there were plenty of places to Sit and relax.  Read a book etc.  There was a nice garage under the hotel and getting places was easy.  I liked this better than the Marriott location that was three blocks away.Rooms were clean and the staff was friendly.  Waterfront view was beautiful and you could sit outside and have your breakfast.  We were there in January so it was a little nippy.It is a hidden gem.We were upgraded to a beautiful water view room and we loved it. Clean, reasonably priced, friendly staff, and a great property.  The only downside was that in some brochures they advertise a free breakfast which we were under the impression they had.  It was a little disappointing that they didn't ad the breakfast choices to by are not amazing a little overpriced.  You are not within walking distance of the touristy things so we did have to drive which wasn't fun, but we didn't have to pay for parking which was nice.","It was a nice hotel, but I think that the name is deceiving.  The location was pretty inconvenient considering how close it was to downtown.  You are right next to highways going everywhere so forget about walking.The parking is free, which is cool.This is a beautiful hotel with a friendly staff.The rooms appear to be clean.The location on the water is splended.This hotel had a beautiful view and lovely premises (including an outdoor pool, fire pit, hot tub, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating), and is fairly close to downtown. The staff is very friendly and competent; in particular, the front desk clerk (Sara), the extremely hardworking breakfast staff, and the housekeeping staff.The view was 5 stars.  The staff was nice and helpful but on the downside... we didn't spend our time in the small room. We had to pay extra for breakfast but the overall experience was nice.Location: The waterfront view is cool. It is about 1.5-2 miles from the historic district so maybe not within walking distance in the Charleston summer heat.  There is a Marriott property right down the street also.Also, looks like it is within walking distance of some hospitals in the downtown area.Great view... Of a parking lot. Room could not be exchanged for twin-bed room, and waited a VERY long time to check in. Overall, nice lobby and pool area, but the view and balcony offerings are misleading- we were shocked to see a foot-wide balcony with a plastic table and chairs crammed onto it. Overall, a mediocre experience. Staff, however, were overall very friendly.I was in Charleston with friends who had their reception dinner at the Courtyard Charleston Waterfront. What I saw of the hotel was incredibly nice, they have a good location, the staff was very attentive and helpful, the views are amazing (overlooks the yachts in the marina) and the Food Was INCREDIBLE! They prepared a low country boil with shrimp, potato, sausage, and corn. I Had a great time! Although I did not stay in one of their rooms one of the employees mentioned all the rooms had just been renovated. My recommendation is based upon a reception dinner and not an actual stay at the hotel as I only attended a reception there.Great property with a awesome a harbor view !We chose this location rather than a downtown hotel to save a little on costs.  We were very happy with our choice - we had a rental car so no problem to drive into the historic area and pay a little for parking, it is too far to walk.  They have an hourly or twice an hour shuttle into downtown but it was cheaper for us to drive and park than pay the per person fee.  You can do an internet search to find a map of public parking garages in downtown.We've stayed in much nicer hotels, but we were happy with everything provided - covered parking and wifi included rather than an additional charge.  We stayed on the 4th floor and noise was not an issue.  Our room had a horrible view - of the VA medical center across the street.  A couple times we came back late and had to park outside which as only an issue due to the heat in the summer.  If we had known about the laundry machines we would have maybe packed a little lighter.  Cleaning staff were great - left a bag of fresh towels and bathroom stuff outside our door when we opted to skip the daily cleaning a couple of times. The pool and jacuzzi were adequate.  We had afternoon cocktails and sat on the deck a couple of times, and had the breakfast once.  I didn't feel well one night so H got cup of noodles from the food market behind the registration desk. The front desk has a cooler with fruit infused water - so if you're really looking to pinch pennies I guess you could fill your water bottle here before you head out into the heat.  Hotel staff were all very friendlyWe'll definitely look into Marriott Courtyard for future travel - as long as they have the same amenities.Only issues were - construction of some condos going on in the plot next door so there was some morning noiseAnd final issue which is not the hotel's fault/problem-entrance is only from the southbound direction of Lockwood, so you have to U turn if you are going northbound on Lockwood, or access Lockwood from Spring St.  Our navigation map incorrectly showed that you can turn from Bee street westbound to Lockwood southbound, but this is not true.  When you're at the intersection the arrows all direct you to turn north/right onto Lockwood.I give this Courtyard a less than desirable rating for two reasons.  1. The check-in process has you parking way out of the way and you cant get there from the parking area,2. The TVs have not been upgraded and should be high on their priority list of needs.This hotel is classic courtyard marriott.  The rooms are clean, fairly comfortable (courtyard marriott beds don't agree with me for some reason).  The hotel also has free parking which is a big deal if you are driving into town as parking downtown can be a nightmare.  The 3 stars comes from the location and desk staff.  The location is across a major road from downtown, so it is not really walkable unless the weather is perfect.  It is also near the hospital, so it is a bit sketchy at night, so to get to the old city downtown, one has the option of trying to find parking or catching a cab.Also, the front desk while nice was not all that helpful.  We arrived around 11pm on a Friday night (gotta love those O'hare delays), and the first lady at the desk could not give us the name of any place in the area that was open, and the second lady sent us to two places that after a 15 minute sketchy walk (see above) were also both closed.  We ended up ordering at 1am from pizza hut.Beautiful hotel with hot tub and pool!  We were here for a wedding at the Thomas Bennett house, so it was very convenient.  The staff was very friendly.  The room was comfortable.  Nicer than your average hotel ... no continental breakfast though -- bummer.Pretty location and the outdoor breakfast had great views and excellent service. The MUSC discount was about 1/2 price and conveniently located less than a mile from the hospital. The walls were pretty thin and there were few amenities, until I learned there were glasses and a coffee maker in the hutch. Lobby coffee was good. It was a comfortable stay.Great hotel on the water. Have some construction currently (fall 2012) but it is not intrusive. Staff was helpful, rooms great, breakfast average but well priced.  10 minutes from waterfront and historic district.Nice hotel, pretty convenient to get to places, but a little tricky to get back to from downtown.  The staff were very nice and helpful, I don't have any complaints at all.  I would definitely stay there again.",,,,"['quickly', 'becoming', 'preferred', 'hotel', 'brand', 'due', 'part', 'experiences', 'affordable', 'courtyard', 'branded', 'locations', 'another', 'solid',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-charleston-historic-downtown-charleston-2,Holiday Inn Charleston Historic Downtown,3.5,$$$,39,"Sure I have stayed in more fancy hotels, plenty of them. I have stayed in much more expensive hotels, plenty of them. But this Holiday Inn was perfect for what it was and where it is in Charleston. Comfortable room, clean, modern. Nice lobby, nice little restaurant with an included breakfast. The price was reasonable. Easy walk to everything. We walked to the Battery from there and back which is a pleasant way to go through the historic district and be ""looky loos"".Worst IHG experience ever. Doesn't even deserve the 1 star given!!If there was a way to get my money back I would ask for it.  Valet is $16 per night plus tax and they damaged my car door.  Good thing car is under warranty because it was fixed for free.  The rate per night was $171(govt rate) but includes nothing, no free breakfast, wifi or even decent coffee.  The ONLY good thing about the hotel is the prime location.  Its close to EVERYTHING which we decided to walk everywhere due to limited parking in downtown Charleston.There was construction going on, no warning about it, which caused the entire hotel to shake from 8-5 like it was a constant earthquake.  It may my daughter sick to the point my parents switched hotels and eventually I did as well.  Then the smell throughout the hotel was disgusting, smelled like raw sewage ugh, the dryer was broke maintenance didn't know how to fix it, no microwaves in the rooms and apparently no daily housekeeping service either.  I wouldn't recommend this particular location to anyone.This hotel is as nice as it looks. The receptionist told me it had been redone 2.5 years ago, and it shows.I was only gonna stay one night, but I liked it so much I stayed two more. The saltwater pool is lovely, the staff is super-friendly, and it's convenient to walk downtown. I especially liked the giant shower stall, which is more pleasant to use than the cramped bathtubs you usually get in hotels. While you're in Charleston, I suggest you go to Shem Creek to see the dolphins in the afternoon, check out the lovely, quiet beaches of Sullivan's Island and tour the Slave Mart Museum.I ate at Charleston's Cafe one day, and it was fabulous.It is located in the dip of the inlet of Charleston.  The area is referred to as the ""Culinary district.""  Pro: walking distance to the bars, local shops,etc.  The staff was great!Con: Valet parking at $20 a day. No shuttle service within a 10 block radius. No buffet breakfast on Sunday.We were pleased with our stay at this Holiday Inn location in historic downtown Charleston, SC.  We received great services and accommodations from everyone whom we encountered.  1) This Holiday Inn doesn't offer self-parking.  Everything was done by the valet service.  However, the valet young men were very courteous.  If you are coming off I-26 (this interstate ends at downtown Charleston) and continuing onto Meeting St., turn onto Woolfe and then make a U-turn at one (1) of the commercial lots.  That way you can park at the ""valet loading &amp; unloading zone"" and have the valet personnel take care the rest for you.  2) The check-in time is 1600 hour.  If you arrive early, you can check in and have your luggage restored before your room is ready.  3) Where the hotel is located is on the verge of ""sketchy"" and ""touristy"" areas.  I personally don't recommend you to head toward the I-26 direction unless you're very comfortable with the surroundings.  4) This Holiday Inn is about one (1) block east from King St.  Some Yelpers might disagree with me on this, but I liked the north-side portion of the King St. because there were some local eateries, fine dining, and places I saw local residents would hang out at.  5) The actual ""market"" would be located on the south side of downtown Charleston.  Parking in that area was a major struggle for us.  If you don't mind walking, it's approximately twenty (20) to thirty (30) minutes worth of walk.  6) They don't offer a complementary continental breakfast, yet they have a restaurant on site, which offers a buffet-style breakfast, happy hours, dinner, and late-night bar.  7) Complementary coffee was always plenty in the lobby.  8) The room was nice.  The AC was certainly strong and could be adjusted accordingly.  The only minor problem was the water leakage in the bathroom.  Otherwise, everything else was satisfactory.  9) If you need a taxi service to the airport or somewhere else, let the hotel front desk person know because they have a ""chartered guy"" they like to use.  For me, it was $15/person to CHS.  10) I wanted to give a shout-out to John, one of the Holiday Inn valet crew.  He was always on top of things and volunteered to help us with luggage.  Holiday Inn Charleston Historic Downtown could be one of the most affordable hotels in the area.  I will definitely consider stay here again if I ever come back to Charleston in the futureWe stayed here while downtown celebrating a friend's bachelorette weekend! They were great at accommodating us with checking in early. The front desk staff were all so friendly and we felt like friends by the end of our visit. They were attentive and helpful with all of our needs. The room was average sized with two full beds. The linens and pillows were great! They offered two firm and two soft pillows per bed, which was nice. Most hotels don't have such nice ones on the bed.The pool area was interesting. It is on the second floor and is oddly placed/shaped. We did find an area to lay out, but it was just... weird. The pool itself was very clean and the water felt fantastic.My complaint. The doors and walls are very thin. At 7am, we heard so many people in the hallway. Breakfasts being delivered, room service starting, others checking out. I felt as though they were practically in the room making this noise. It was quite frustrating when we weren't going to be getting up that early- after having a late night.We were worried about the construction when we checked in on Friday about 3pm, but it was in no way an issue. Noise stopped at 4pm, and we never heard another peep during our stay (checked out Sunday am). Awesome location, trolley stop right across the street, easy and short ride to anything you want to do. Room was big and comfy. We were happy and would stay there again on our next visit.This was a nice, clean, new hotel to stay in during my time in Charleston. It definitely looks new. The valet parking guys were really helpful in calling cabs for me (I didn't have a car). The room itself was large and well kept. It's not necessarily the most convenient location though if you don't have a car. I either had to do 30 minute walks to anywhere I had to go or I had to get my friend to pick me up. For the quality and the price it was worth it though.On a long weekend we stayed in the 5th floor corner suite. The suite was amazing. Great view of the bridge.We have two young kids and the suite provided extra room for them to play. Plus, when bed time came around we put one on the sleeper and one in a pack and play in the bedroom. The bathroom was huge!The room was not cheap but we thought it was worth it for the size and added convenience with two young kids.The hotel itself is modern, open, and feels welcoming.The staff was incredibly friendly and arranged an early check-in for us. They also have valet parking and the valet staff was prompt and helpful.One thing to be aware of: This hotel is on the very edge of the historic district. It's a short walk to the shopping on King Street. The historic district in Charleston is best experienced by walking so note that you'll do a bit more when staying here. It is also about a block into a part of the community that has not yet experienced the gentrification of the rest of the historic district.Walking distance to a lot of good bars and restaurants. The hotel itself is nice and clean. The staff if very friendly and was very willing to make suggestions on place to check out  around the area.   There is a ""roof"" top pool, on the 2nd floor.  It is on a roof, but its is not the very top of the building, which is 3 floors higher.    The rooms were clean and quiet, but views were not that spectacular.  Bed's were firm and comfy.  We didn't get one of the walkin shower rooms, but everything was still nice.  There is no free parking at this hotel.  You have to valet your car for ~$17 a night.  They have system of car elevators in which they store your car.  This valet is ran 24hrs a day though. I would not pay retail for this though, but do use priceline or something similar.Located about a 15-20 minute walk from the downtown area where most things are happening. Bathroom wasn't as clean as I would've liked. You can see some footprints and I also found two empty nip bottles on the shelves under the sink in the bathroom so I'm not sure how thorough the staff cleans.Also be mindful of your belongings and leaving them in your hotel room. On our last day there we went out briefly for a run and left the do not disturb sign on our door before heading out. When we got back to pack to leave, I realized all the cash in my wallet was missing. Reported it to the staff and management only to realize they don't have security cameras in the hallways. They were able to confirm based on the key card that someone did enter the room even though there was a do not disturb sign on the door. Also, just an fyi if something like this does happen to you, file the police report that moment. Since I had to rush to catch a flight, the manager said I could file a police report over the phone. When I got home to file the report, the police said that I can't file over the phone. Ultimately, the manager was able to help me file the report but this whole process has been dragged out longer than it needed to be. The whole process took more than a week before I was finally able to file the police report. The officer also informed me because it took a while for me to file the police report there's little they can do about it. Obviously the corporate Holiday Inn office and local office are playing tag and no one is taking responsibility for the inaccurate information and just keep dragging out this process. I expected more from a large chain like this. Overall, staff was friendly and the manager was willing (but inefficient) to help us with the ordeal but whether you can trust them or not, you can be the judge.I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Staff was super friendly and always available to answer any of our questions. They have valet parking.  Downtown is close by and it's just a quick walk away. Rooms were clean, turn down service was great.  Would definitely stay here again.This is a new location that just opened in February. On Meeting that is a couple blocks from restaurants, etc. this is another part of Charleston going through improvements.Hotel is great, nicely laid out, easy valet (you will not self park here) and a full restaurant and bar. As an FYI, THE GRITS HERE ARE SOME OF THE BEST!Holiday Inn is making many upgrades to current hotels and building new. I was impressed!I absolutely loved this hotel.  Great location, friendly staff, and an amazing room.  The pool was a plus too.  Worth the higher price.Super friendly and knowledgeable staff. We stayed 9/18-9/20. Jaime, one of the front desk girls (long dark hair and glasses) gave us great tourist and restaurant recommendations. Walking distance to great King Street finds! Rooms were clean and comfortable. Valet parking, but it is $16/day. Would definitely stay again.This place is great! Friendly service and really close to a really pretty park! You do have to request a river view in advance.My wife's $300 Oakely Sunglasses were stolen out of the room.  We called the manager and he more or less told us that we most likely lost them and they were not stolen.   They were definitely stolen and we know 100% that we left them next to the coffee maker on the table.  I highly suggest that you not stay at this hotel because they are thieves and the management will not help you in getting your STOLEN items back.  They should do a better job at doing background checks and keeping an eye on their house keeping staff.   They even know the woman that was I. Our room but said she left for the day.  Very condescending mangers running this place.My wife and I arrived today only to be told our reservations had been thwarted to another Holiday Inn. This was a complete mix up with a larger grouping agency(exped$&amp;)...which whom we will never grace with our business EVER AGAIN. They were rude and unprofessional to say the very least. We had the ABSOLUTE PLEASURE of working with Tammy through this disaster of a debacle and she could not have been any more perfect. TAMMY needs a raise and complete utmost respect for making a bad situation not only tolerable but copesetic and compliant with all 4 parties involved. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this supervisor and will recommend this hotel to friends and family for years to come.Paul MatuszynskiThoroughly enjoyed the stay at this hotel.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Room clean and comfortable.   Restaurant very good.  A little extra walking but no problem. Convenient to visitors center.  Free trolly was helpful.  Hope to return and would recommend this hotel.  Don O.The Holiday Inn Express chain has been a consistent performer for me as I have travelled across they country. I rarely experience anything out of the ordinary, and if there is an issue, they handle it quickly with a smile.This location is definitely one of the higher end designs of the chain with a very modern and open feel. The staff was super friendly and helpful, and they offer valet parking. They also have a GREAT restaurant inside of the hotel that offers up quite a few southern dishes with a spin.The room on the fourth floor was spacious, clean, modern, and had everything I needed. I also noticed that they stock the bathroom with Bath and Bodyworks products, so that is a nice feature.The only objectionable issues is due to their location. The room balcony did not offer up much of a view, and the hotel is a few blocks from the busy part of Charleston downtown, but it's definitely within walking distance. This is the best hotel that I have stayed in while visiting downtown Charleston; the right value, the right service, and the convenience makes this HIE location a great deal.","For a holiday inn, this is a really nice hotel. The outdoor is nice. Our group was less than a 5 minute walk to King St. Going out in the city was not a problem. The staff was friendly and helpful. If you are coming for any occasion, I strongly encourage this hotel.If you are a music promoter do NOT reserve here for your artists unless you are there with your credit card when they check in. They will not be able to check in and will end up endlessly debating bullshit with the front desk when they should be getting up for flights. Failing hard. Hard.Pros:The hotel is very modern looking and super clean. Tammy and Kristen at the front desk went above and beyond for us! The pool area was clean and a nice place to hang out and relax. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. The shower was huge and had great water pressure.Cons:It is a 15 to 20 minute walk to the market where all the tourist stuff is. The bartenders were not great. They were slow and didn't know how to make some drinks. The internet was slow and I was unable to print my boarding pass from the computers in the hall.My husband and 2 kids came to Charleston yesterday for a church conference for a week  .We have 2 adjoining rooms.If I could give a neg 5 stars rating right now, I would . Yesterday at check in it would have been 1 star and that was because the staff was polite, especially the person in charge.But this morning at 5:45a they are definitely in the negative.After check in , I walked into my room and smelt mold so strong ,it's been around for a while . I am head of Health and Safety at my job so I know mold when I smell it. I started my inspection of the room. Of course right by the air conditioning vent there is a panel full of mold.Gross!. We called the front desk,of course there were no rooms left that were adjoining. The guy in charge comes and offers to have house keeping come with bleach and wipe it off. This is what amateurs do .They wipe  the mold off the surface but the spores are still there and it comes right back .This is probably why it was such a strong mold smell in that room .I told him no, they had to replace the panel  and disinfect the area before putting the new one up. The head guy came with a ladder and did this himself while we went to eat. Where is maintenance? SMH !We returned to a new panel and a better smelling room.Tell me why at 5:30 this morning I hear water running in the bathroom . I wake up my husband to check it out and he comes back to tell me there's water coming through the light in the shower from upstairs. This is is truly crazy! We call the front desk. They were very nice .Still no empty adjoining rooms .Maintenance starts at 7 a. We have 4 people to get dress this morning. They offered for us to use the shower in a room on the other side of the hotel .Too inconvenient ! We will have to get up early and use the shower in the kids room so we won't be late. Go to use the shower in the kids room the shower door is missing a handle and the door swings. This is going to be a long week!Apparently this is a new location. Although some of the old reviews are still listed, I assure you they no longer apply. Read on if you are heading toward Charleston. White glove treatment from Kevin, the manager. We referred to him as The Handsome Professional. He also lead us to the most fun we've had on any trip and I'll highlight those places in other reviews here. Pleasantly caught off guard when the head housekeeper said, ""Have a nice day Miss K!"" When is the last time someone at a chain hotel greeted you by name or giggled along with you as you recounted your experiences? Although it looks like a chain hotel it has the service of a b &amp; b. If there were 6 stars, I'd offer them to Jamie, Jessie, Brendan, Nicole, Kristen and Brooks... so many standouts. When they say Southern Hospitality, they mean that you will be welcomed and ushered into such fine and relaxing experiences. We were simply amazed by the service. The small pool was the perfect temperature both morning and evening. The place is immaculately clean. Designed with porcelain tile, contemporary furnishings and comfy beds. Wireless is easy and free. Bonus: it is just a block or two from King Street and all their valet/transportation arrangements are swift and easy. I see nothing standing in your way. Book it!I really enjoyed staying here during my five night visit.  I was in town for a friend's wedding and decided to make it a mini vacation.  The room was clean and spacious.  As a vacation hotel, this is a nice clean location.  Staff was friendly and efficient with check in and out.  It is about an easy flat 20 minute walk to the touristy part of Charleston.  One can walk, take a pedi-cab, or take the local free downtown bus.  There is a bus stop right across the street.  One block over is King Street with a number of bars and restaurants.  I preferred this location over downtown because of its location to King Street and its night life.  Only available parking is valet which adds to the cost of vacationing.  I would recommend skipping the car rental since everything is pretty easy to walk to and parking is difficult anywhere in downtown Charleston.  Parking is a premium anywhere in the main part of city since it is located on a peninsula.  Think San Francisco or Manhattan.The place is clean and convenient, but the staff is not the greatest. I stayed here for 2 weeks. The Internet went down multiple times. When the laundry machine was out of order they didn't help out. Their services close down before the time they advertise. We valeted our car once, and they said we'd be charged valet service for every day we were at the hotel. They will not go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. Eh.Very clean modern hotel. The front desk employees were all extremely friendly and accommodating. Would recommend staying here.Had a great time while staying here a fee weeks ago. Jamie was on top of all of the front desk operations whether it was checking people in or handling guest issues she kept her kool and composure. She was also good with recommending good restaurants in the area. What impressed me the most was how she handled the question of ""is this area safe?"" To which she responded ""it is under restoration"" she did not skip a beat and is a great asset to your hotel.Clean room and friendly service.  We were there to visit the city, didn't use any of the amenities, but they looked nice.  We did use the valet parking because it was all they had.  Valet were nice and timely.  It's in good walking distance to downtown so we didn't take the car out very often.We just checked in today and are sorely disappointed. To begin with our rooms weren't ready and that's understandable because it was 1:00.  We were told they would call us when the rooms were ready and they didn't. We returned to the hotel at 4 and they were ready. Our friends got up to there room, pulled the covers back to slip in for a quick nap and the sheets were dirty!! There was hair and crumbs on the sheets, how gross is that? Of course the hotel changed the sheets, but not a great way to start this last leg of our trip. This hotel is on the absolute edge of town. It borders an area that has not been redeveloped and we didn't feel safe walking at night.  It is close to the Visitor's Center and the free trolley and in the daylight you wouldn't feel uncomfortable walking. The free trolley is a bust as it's extremely crowded and takes awhile to catch one and get around. There is a lot of traffic so driving isn't preferable, but since this hotel is so far from the heart of the Historic District you need your car, a cab or the funky trolley. Wish we'd stayed somewhere else.We stayed here for six days while attending the Family Circle Cup and had kind, attentive, and friendly service from EVERYONE (from the front desk to the valet dudes to the housekeepers.) Our requests ranged from, ""Can you pull my car up immediately?"" to ""Do you have a bandaid?"" to ""Can we borrow an umbrella?"" Yes, Yes, and Yes were the responses. Hospitality in Charleston is legendary and the staff at the Ho-Inn are no exception.Yes, it was a bit expensive, but (a) it's brand new(b) it was the FCC tournament(c) Charleston has a shortage of newer hotels that don't smell like the 1900s'Nuf said.This review is for the bar and happy hour.  What a great experience.  The staff was so accommodating.  They opened early just for us.  There was wireless in the bar area, so we were able to have our project meeting in the comfortable and beautiful surroundings.  Best part, the drinks were very reasonable and there was incredible food!  The chef came out and greeted us as brought wonderful tapas.  We had hummus, fresh made pickled vegetable, buffalo shrimp, and creme brulee all on the house.  This is now my favorite place for meetings.HOLY LORD! Bed BUGS!! My best friends sister AND dad just stayed here and found out that there were bed bugs!! Her sister said that after she saw a bug scurrying towards her at 1am, she put 2 and 2 together.  It was so big that originally she thought it was a baby cockroach!  The next morning she talked to the house keeping and the housekeeper said that she had a list and that my friends sisters room was ON THE LIST of rooms with bed bugs!! EEWWW!!! Their one saving grace was that after she found out that evening what they were, they immediately placed both her and her father in a new room, but how can you sleep after that?!  This place needs to shut down and call in the Orkin man!  DO NOT GO HERE!Holiday Inns can be hit or miss.  This one is a hit hit hit.  The only difference between this Holiday Inn and a business traveler's Marriott or Hilton was that it lacked an Executive Lounge.TWO WORDS: BED BUGS!My cousin got married two weeks ago in Charleston. The bridal party and the guest stayed at this hotel. My sister and father were in room 430. My sister stays up late because she works night shift. They flew in on Friday, the wedding was Saturday and their departure was Monday. SUNDAY night, I get at text from my sister saying they are in a brand new, clean hotel and a small ""roach"" the size of her pinkie finger nail came straight for her. Well that ""roach"" was a bed bug. And after she was attacked by 10 - I REPEAT 10- which she massacred, she woke my dad up to find that THREE were on his back. ONE FULL of blood. They called the front desk and were promptly moved to a different room. Mind you bed bugs can easily travel in suitcases or on linens- so they could have brought bed bugs from room 430 to the new room. (also the previous two nights she did not stay up to see the bed bugs, but did text me that she was bit by something). My problem is this 1. there were bed bugs- but the next day at check out the manager wanted to charge my sister and father for the room! they had to argue with him to be compensated- even after he wanted to charge them for valet parking! eventually, everything was comped. The front desk staff was very accommodating, efficient, and nice assisting my dad and sister. It was the manager on duty who did not want to comp the rooms. My dad and sister were not the only guest to get bed bugs either, other guest reported bites including the bridal party.Finally- CHECK ALL ROOMS AT ANY HOTEL YOU STAY AT FOR BED BUGS. You can do this by lifting up the mattress and visually inspecting for bugs, look around the wall, head board, and bed for rust colored stains. Never put your luggage close to the wall or bed, instead place on the luggage rack and put in the middle of the room- also invest in hard luggage that does not zip and bed bugs can not climb into those types of cases.Since this yelp review I have emailed HGI corporate and the manager of the hotel at Charleston both have assured me that this situation has been dealt with and that they have had bed bug inspectors and exterminators at the hotel and have been given a clean bill. So if anyone else stays here and finds bed bugs let the hotel know so they can promptly address the issue.Hotel was new, clean, friendly but it is not located any where near historic down town. You have to drive the few miles to get there. They only offer valet parking for $16 a day and every time you need your car you have to call for it and tipping gets pricey. You could try and park on the street but it's on the fringe of a shady part of town (ladies of the evening hanging across the street) and there is a lot of construction going on with new buildings going up making spots near the hotel impossible to find. Although we didn't hear any noise from the construction, our room was on that side and we had to make sure the drapes were shut. We had drinks that evening at the bar, and were the only ones in there. We ate breakfast at that restaurant, good food but not a lot. $2.50 for a cup of coffee. It's clear that they are rebuilding the area and it will be a nice place to stay once that's completed. If you don't mind tipping constantly to get your car and driving into historic downtown this will suit your needs fine. Again it's brand new(beds are still comfy, sheets soft) and the staff was very nice and accomodating.My boyfriend took me to Charleston for my birthday in April and chose to stay at this location to be downtown near bars, restaurants, and my friends from college.  It was amazing!  When we got there we were upgraded to a larger sutie, the girls at the front desk were awesome, especially Stephanie and Tracy? I think those are their names, but at any rate, the two young girls who worked there in the evenings on the weekends--they were obviously young in the hospitality industry but made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our stay!  Kudos ladies and the new Holiday Inn-we'll definitely be staying here next time.A hospitality disappointment. Terrible experience. While the hotel is new it is in a transitioning area not the main downtown well-known historic district that comes to mind when thinking of Charleston. We booked &amp; paid in advance through holiday inn website then hotel charged again for taxes &amp; tried to tell us we had not paid for that expense yet.... Parking is only valet &amp; cars are put on stacked lifts- no other parking options available. There were glasses &amp; dishes outside of the rooms on our hallway which remained there for the duration of our stay (2 nights). If that is how they are with how they are with cleaning dishes &amp; public hallways it makes one wonder where else they are skimping. At check-in we were offered just a cart without assistance for 3 ladies. I could imagine where this may not be a standard at a holiday inn express but for a main holiday inn I feel that it was lacking.",,,,"['sure', 'fancy', 'hotels', 'plenty', 'much', 'expensive',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-charleston-downtown-riverview-charleston,SpringHill Suites Charleston Downtown/Riverview,4.0,$$,22,"Clean room, friendly staff, nice property, good food on the breakfast bar. Will most definitely stay again on my next trip to Charleston.This Springhill Suites is dated.  It looks like they threw some paint on the walls, changed the bedding, threw in the wet bar and called it ""recently renovated"".  Our room is a bit musty, and the bathroom looked a bit worn with dated fixtures.  They have a free continental breakfast in the lobby each morning.  It was the usual disappointment that a ""free continental breakfast"" is.  Eggs, sausage and pancakes getting weird, and rubbery in warming dishes... bags and cheap bread for toast... out of season fruit (bananas, oranges, apples).  If it had been up to me, I would have rather paid for a real meal rather than eat that sad display.I stayed at Springhill Suites Marriott in May for a wedding, the room was approx. $200/night.  The reason we chose this location was because it was about half the price of the hotels in downtown Charleston.  It was a close to the city, 5-10 min. drive, about a $10 Uber ride, though only about 2 miles away, it was not really walk-able because of the bridges that separate this hotel from downtown.There was a nice walking/bike path down the street from the hotel, it weaved a few miles through a residential part of town.  That was probably the most enjoyable part about my stay at the Springhill Suites Marriott at Ripley Point.I really enjoyed my (brief) stay at this property last week. The king suite was a great value at $103+tax! My room was modern, clean, big enough, and had a small balcony. Front desk staff was friendly and honored my only two requests prior to arrival (high floor room and room far from elevator). I wasn't able to take advantage of some of the amenities such as the complimentary shuttle to downtown or breakfast, but it was nice to know they were available. If I return to Charleston again, I hope I can be a guest here again.Found this place for a last minute get away. Perfect size for our family. Breakfast was good with kids too. Best thing,,,the shuttle back and forth to downtown in the evenings. No parking hassles. Very clean and great customer service. This is our go to for family stays in Charleston.Nice, clean and very accommodating. All of the staff members were helpful and professional. Overall, an exceptional stay.Wonderful large rooms. Clean and neat.  Lobby is on the second floor but there is an elevator to take you up. Friendly and helpful staff. Free parking. Free wifi. Free hot and cold breakfast buffet. Free shuttle to the historic district.  Free cookies and hot drinks at night.  Right on the marina with some great views and photo shots. Only negative so far? No restaurants within walking distance but they do have menus for delivery options.  I was able to get a good price on Priceline of132. Reasonable for the location and items included. I would recommend it and stay here again.The accommodations were wonderful and the staff was exceptional. The breakfast was great and the closeness to downtown was a huge convenience. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and eager to help. I had a great experience at Springhill Suites and I checkout with a smile on my face. This hotel gets my highest recommendation and I look forward to my next visit.TamaraNice place to stay overall. Very convenient shuttle to downtown starting at 5pm till 11pm, the drivers are all friendly, knowledgable, and great at engaging you during your trip. The room had 2 nice sized TVs, a clean king sized bed, and roomy bathroom. The room also had a large window, and plenty of lights. My only negative about the room are the pillows, may want to bring your own, mine were way to soft.Breakfast in the morning is fantastic, a huge variety of food, and everything I had (grits, corn beef hash, turkey bacon, bagels, and muffins) was a delight to eat.I would stay here again.A pretty hotel, but the beds seemed smaller than expected.  Still, the room was comfy &amp; there was plenty of space.  It was however, impossible to shower without getting water all over the floor in our room- I think the shower curtain just wasn't long enough.  We were there when it was raining &amp; the front desk clerk suggested we take the stairs off the lobby down to the parking lot- that was a mistake! The steps were SO slippery due to the rain that I went slipping &amp; sliding down them (painful!). So, if it's raining, avoid those steps like the plague- otherwise it's a comfy hotel.  Breakfast was what you'd expect from a breakfast buffet at a hotel.  Edible, but you'd be better off getting breakfast in town.Great location to access downtown Charleston and quite a savings over downtown.  We didn't even use the free shuttle because of our schedule, but it's 5-10 easy minutes to the free parking along the Battery.  Can't beat it.  It was very convenient to be able to quickly jump back to the hotel and then go back downtown for dinner.  Staff was great and breakfast was definitely above par.Actually 3-1/2 stars.  The rooms are a contemporary take on a standard suite-style room.  We were on a recently renovated floor, which was bright and cheerful.  Our room was clean, and faced the marina (the other side faces a natural river wetland.  We booked here because it's a bargain compared to downtown hotels, parking is free, AND they've a free shuttle to/from downtown.  It's a 10 minute ride and has friendly drivers who know all the best places to eat in town.We arrived by rental car; did I say that parking is free?  That's a plus if you're planning on visiting the plantations along the Ashley River (15-20 minutes away.)  Note that there's an elevator to the 2nd floor lobby; we found it after we'd dragged our bags up the large open stair.  The staff was fantastically welcome and helpful.  Though I'm a Marriott preferred guest, most hotels in this chain simply record the number, add the points, and go about their business.  At this property, a gift bag with maps, bottled water, and cookies were handed to me at check-in.  Nice!A complimentary hot breakfast is included.  This includes scrambled eggs, home fries, and a breakfast meat, so this is a real plus.There were two issues (otherwise a 4-star rating), which we reported to the desk.  Hopefully they'll make the fixes and your stay will be even better:  Wifi connections were slow, and occasionally dropped out; the TV had a peculiar connection problem, where it worked when we swung the unit from the wall, but lost the signal when we pushed it back, flush to the wall.I booked this stay a few months back using a complimentary Marriott Certificate I had earned. The front desk personal was super friendly. The gentleman gave may a welcome gift local treat and a bottle of water. He also me offered another 2 beverages and a snack from the marketplace store.My room was located on the top floor and had a outdoor balcony and a view of the harborThey offer a shuttle here twice an hour to the downtown area if you don't have a car which is great. They also offer complimentary breakfast daily, although I didn't eat here.Overall I was happy with my stay here and would return again in the future.I would definitely stay here again. The hotel is right outside downtown Charleston (only a ten minute drive to King St). They had a very nice, hot complimentary breakfast every morning until 10:00 a.m. The hotel also offered free nightly shuttle service to downtown Charleston. We had a suite which was very large (included and kitchenette) and overlooked a marina. The only negative I have to say is that there could be more variety in the breakfast every morning (but hey, it was free) and the pool could have been bigger. But overall, I would stay here again!Giving this place 2 stars as it has some work to do to get to the 3 or 4 star range. First, the room was very nice and updated. Didn't really like the placement of the TV as it was hard to see if you were lying on the far side of the bed, but that is a small detail. The bed was really awkward. There wasn't a mattress cover, but a blanket under the fitted sheet. It moved anytime you moved in the bed and caused wrinkles that you could feel under the sheet. Next, the duvet did not have a cover on it. I would not imagine those are washed after each guest, so I would have wanted to see a cover on it. Also, the duvet was way too small for the bed. It barely reached the edges of the bed and did not work when there were 2 people sharing the bed. It was a war all night pulling back and forth to try and stay covered by the duvet.Now comes the worst part. We were woken up by construction at 7:45am. It sounded like someone was trying to come through the wall behind the bed. When I told the front desk about this, they stated that construction wasn't supposed to start until 9 or 10am. It's a little shocking that as a hotel manager, you didn't know that your hotel was having construction completed on it before it was scheduled. Also a little shocking, the construction manager was standing somewhere nearby and heard our conversation and came around to say sorry and ask if we wanted it stopped. Of course by that time, we were up and packed and nothing needed to be done. Didn't think it was too professional him stepping into our conversation while I was speaking to the manager, but that is not necessarily the hotel's fault. Also, the shuttle to downtown needs to stick to its schedule a little better. It was over 15 minutes late and we almost missed our dinner reservations due to this. Lastly, housekeeping needs to check the balconies when they are cleaning the rooms as we found a water-bottle full of cigarettes on our balcony. If the bed situation and construction can get under control, I would recommend this hotel as a good option versus the outrageously expensive hotels in DT Charleston.While not as well appointed as newer Springhill Suites, I found this to be a comfortable and well run hotel.  I have always been impressed with Marriott properties and found you can always count on them for a good stay.  As with most Marriott properties, the bed was very comfortable.  The room was spacious and clean and included a desk and pullout couch.  The only complaint would be the ""crib"" we requested for our child.  It turned out to just be a pack and play.   The staff was courteous and helpful.  The hotel has a mini mart in the lobby that included snacks, drinks, and alcohol.  The included breakfast was a full spread complete with waffles to make, fresh oatmeal, cereal, and fresh entrees.  The breakfast casserole was really good.The property also has a pool and hot tub.  The staff also organizes daily events for the guests.  Combine that with free cocktail hour and parking and this hotel is a great value for the price and is perfect for a weekend stay.Suite is amazing and the staff was very polite. The price was the best was great also. Would definitely come back.We recently stayed at this property while attending a wedding in Charleston.  I stay at Marriott's often, and understand the radical differences of Marriott Suites depending on where you are in the country.that said, this is an older Marriott that really needs updating.  4:3 TVs are the first thing that need to go.  The desk is well set up, but you have to go crawling underneath to plug something in.  BUT...the wifi is free!The beds are comfortable, but this Marriott uses the older A/C units that blow cold air directly at you.  That should be addressed.The bathrooms are fine, but this property uses REALLY cheap curtain hangers that are pretty bent up and unclipped.The breakfast (included) is a bit more robust than some of the other properties I've stayed at, and includes the basics as well as eggs, sausage, ""make your own"" waffles, etc.The location is conveniently on the water....great ambiance.  Also, they do include a shuttle starting at 5pm running to/from downtown.Parking is free...always a nice touch.Overall, I'd probably stay here again, but would definitely appreciate an upgrade between now and then....The location was great; very close to downtown, but the price was very reasonable.  The shuttle and the driver(Stanley) made this an ideal budget location.  The shuttle dropped us off and picked us up at a convenient location.  Even though it was packed everyone was able to fit in and it operated on the published schedule.  There was a good breakfast and a beer tasting when we first arrived.  It's nothing spectacular but it's clean,close to downtown and well priced.I loved the size of the suite, However our room floor was damp where you had to wear shoes all the time. Breakfast buffet was the greatest for this price and plenty of hot dishes. Gym was a decent size clean and modern. The bathroom was small but the shower water pressure was great! Parking can get hard to find if you get back from a night on the town late. A shuttle service is free which drops you off to the downtown French Quarter every hour from 5 pm til 11pm. I would come back and stay and give another star if back in town.i would go back. Nice pool, clean, free happy hour, parking and breakfast and they allow pets. We stayed in a suite which had a kitchen, two separate bedrooms, a common area, two bedrooms and three tvs. There was plenty of room to spread out. They will even do your food shopping for you if you leave them a list. Not bad! ALSO the location is idea close to historic area and folly beach there is also a shuttle to the historic area at night.","Just a decent experience...older amenities, bed is uncofortable, but free parking and free wifi.  Service isn't up to par as other Springhill Suites I have stayed at...will probably not stay here again.Nice hotel and reasonable weekday price if you book directly on their website.  I noticed a $20 price difference between <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and their website. Very clean and decent breakfast selection.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fulton-lane-inn-charleston,Fulton Lane Inn,4.5,$$$,24,"Cute place! Great rate ($199/night for a Friday night in December) which had free internet and breakfast.I particularly enjoyed breakfast as it was brought to your room for no charge--- and not even pressure to tip! They called ahead to let me know breakfast was on its way so I wasn't caught off-guard.Some misc. observations: there was no bathrobe, there was no bottles of water or minibar, there was a fridge in the room but it wasn't plugged in, and the remote control didn't work from the bed (not sure where was the receiver). Secure parking lot in the back. Great location. Wine hour and then sherry hour with free booze each night!We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Fulton Lane Inn. We stopped on our way to Florida for a 2 day stay in Charleston. It was great being in the heart of downtown and being able to walk everywhere. The Inn is so quaint  and lovely. We enjoyed our delivered breakfast and paper in the morning. The staff was exceptional. Received a great price from Hotwire too.Loved it. Great decor, great feel, free evening drinks and nice breakfast.This hotel was perfect for my husband and I.  The staff was great and the hotel couldn't be in a better location.  The parking lot was cheap and convenient.  Rooms were not modern by any means, but were clean and comfortable.  The only negative thing I would have to say is that whatever cleaning solution they use in the bathroom made the floor incredibly slippery.  We both almost fell a few times - once even in shoes!What a great location and price!  I was surprised to find this property at such a great price.  Thank you Hotwire for the $102.00 rate one block from the historic Charleston, SC market.  On King Street this small inn represents what Charleston is all about.  Serving complimentary sherry each evening along with wine and homemade snacks this is Southern hospitality at its best.  The rooms were very large with four post beds and canopies.  The location alone makes this such a great spot and the extras make this the best deal I've found all year!We had a lovely stay in a king suite with jetted tub overlooking king street! The inn was charming and historic without being stuffy.  Our room was huge and the separate sitting areas in the bay window was lovely when they brought breakfast and newspapers every morning!  The love seat and chair TV area was extremely helpful when my sweetie had insomnia. The location was fantastic for everything we wanted to do in Charleston.  My only complaint was the concierge and front desk area.  They were not terribly attentive or helpful.  Upon checkout the desk clerk insulted me by telling me I should do Zumba to lose weight. Totally out of the blue and uncalled for.  I wouldn't go back if she was there.  Otherwise a lovely stay.Great location walkable to almost everything in historic district. Very good breakfast , small menu, included that is either delivered to your room or served to you at your table in the morning.Well this was an absolute delight.  It started with Keisha at reception--she is the perfect combo of class and sass.  The location is convenient to all the shopping on King Street, and the people-watching provides a glimpse into the genteel South.  The value for the money is incredible-- most neighboring hotels start at twice what we paid.  (Hotel TonightTM is a truly great app, and Fulton Lane is on there.)  We stayed in a spacious corner room on the 3rd floor with 2 double beds.Highly recommended!Great location, comfortable bed, super helpful staff. We enjoyed every minute of our stayGreat location, near everything, walking distance to it all. Good service, nice breakfast brought to your room.   The one bad thing is the decoration above the beds are dusty, if you are allergic to dust, bring Claritin.  Great place other than the dusty useless decoration on the bed.We have stayed here several times and will continue to go back. It's beautiful. It's in a great location. You can walk to most everything. The staff are wonderful; accommodating. polite, and very friendly.My wife and I were looking for a nice quiet inn that we could stay at for a long weekend in Charleston. After looking at reviews, photos, and the description on the website we decided on Fulton Lane Inn. The entrance on Fulton Lane and the front reception area where the concierge stayed was very charming. We got our keys and went to our room on the second floor and found a nice room that was close to what we expected. It had a nice queen bed and fireplace with a table and two chairs. It also had a small kitchenette and a decent bathroom. That evening, after a nice outing in Charleston we returned to our room to finally get into bed. I immediately noticed that there was hair on my pillow that wasn't from me or my wife. It looked like the pillow case hadn't been changed. So, I found another pillow in the closet and used it for the night. That morning, I placed the card they give you in your room on the bed that indicated I wanted a full bed linen change.  We left to go get lunch downtown and expected new sheets when we returned. Upon our return, we found that our room door was left cracked open as if someone was inside working. When we entered, there was no one to be found. Not only did they leave our door to our room open, but they also DIDN'T change our sheets like we had requested. When we went into the bathroom to freshen up before we went back out, we found a used toothpick/flosser on the bathroom counter that wasn't ours. So someone had left their dirty used flosser on my counter. So after multiple instances of cleanliness we were hoping nothing else would happen and we could just get through Saturday night and leave Sunday morning. Well, that evening after we came in from dinner and were turning in for the night we found that we didn't have a breakfast card on our door for our Sunday morning breakfast selection. We called the front desk and one was brought up. After all the cleanliness issues and no attention to details with the breakfast card and door left open, we were sorely disappointed with our stay at Fulton Lane Inn. There are many more well respected inns and B&amp;Bs in Charleston to chose from first. This wasn't our first experience at an inn or B&amp;B in multiple cities but unfortunately this will be our last at this establishment. The only reason it's getting two stars instead of the deserved one is because the room would have been a decent stay but blatant disregard to everyday cleanliness and attention to details and people valuables was unforgivable. We definitely were not ""charmed"".UPDATE: I received a questionnaire on 7-29 about our experience at the Fulton Lane Inn. After filling the questionnaire out and emailing it in, I got a phone call from the owner of the inn. After a talk about the issues that we encountered, the owner said she would refund us one nights stay. So, even though the problems did happen, the owner did seem very aware and was more than happy to make things right. This did say a lot about her character.I think your enjoyment of a property like this is dependent on what you expect from a hotel. If you want a business-class place with work space, a variety of food, and modern conveniences, this is not that kind of hotel. Neither is it a discount chain. To expect either is disingenuous. Likewise, you get what you pay for, and certain amenities are only guaranteed with certain room types - the standard room does not get you everything. This is a boutique hotel, something that most US travelers just don't see much, and it's one of the better ones I've stayed in. It boggles my mind that someone would complain about a $200 rate when the Courtyard just up Meeting street is $40 a night more for a basic corporate room, same as every other Courtyard. Even the Days' Inn is $140 a night, for a small room with exterior entry.We stayed here for three nights, and reserved a deluxe king room. What we got was an airy, nicely appointed space in a classy old building with high ceilings, a comfortable four-poster canopy bed, large windows that - while only providing a view of the side of the King's Courtyard across the narrow alley - did let in a comfortable amount of light, and peace and quiet. Wireless internet was fast, included with the room, and low-hassle - only had to sign in once at the beginning of the stay, and the machine was authorized from that point on. Parking was convenient, with in/out privileges. The included continental breakfast was perfectly adequate for a bite to eat to start the day - we'd been hitting the local restaurants hard, and the *last* thing we wanted was a giant pile of food first thing.The staff were consistently friendly and helpful. It's nice that the entrance to the small reception area is off the public street (and quaintly lit with gaslamps). Don't forget that you're not only paying for the room, but the location, and this small hotel is very convenient to everything in historic Charleston. Most of the things you'd want to see or do are within a few minutes' walk. Check your chain hotel expectations at the door, accept that old buildings can smell old and it's OK, and enjoy a slightly different lodging experience.I am a Charleston newbie but I knew King St was right in the heart of this historical town. First of would I recommend? Yes.  But I will have to say that while walking around here I saw plenty of intriguing alternatives and we will try somewhere different the next time we visit here.  I saw some with outdoor pools and more amenities for about the same rates.  Just FYI the King's Court is right next door.Bottom line this was a nice stay but for $129.99 + parking charges you are paying for the convenience.  The rooms at a Fairfield Inn or Hampton Inn are much nicer for a fraction of the cost.  It seems everyone who stays around here for a week or more rents a condo or owns timeshares.The nicest/fanciest hotel in this area here is the Charleston Inn but it runns double the cost of the Fulton. I originally looked this hotel up at <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and now that I am here there are plenty more than what was posted.Parking:  They charge you $12 a day in addition to your rate.  It is right behind the hotel and honestly unless you are going to Folly Beach you will not need your car.  Location: It is conveniently located in a block away from Mart St.  Excellent location within walking distance from all there is to do here even Ft Sumpter is within a few blocks.  There's the market or French Quarters and all the horse carriage rides are all very close.I now truly understand the difference between an Inn and a hotel in this city.  You can barely see this hotel as you drive by.  We thought to ourselves ""oh my God"" this is not what it looked like online BUT...It is surprisingly very very nice.  it is small and personable but with elegance its definately a nice place.  The staff here was so friendly and very helpful. The rooms are very nice with high ceilings and beautiful tall windows with great views.  The rooms are a little dated but very nice and clean.  The bathroom was okay.  The water pressure was just right.  I did not care for the lighting.  There was none except for the lamps.  There was free wifi access and the rates included a complimentary breakfast  and newspaper delivered to your door.  But you will not find eggs and bacon on the menu.  It is either freshly baked pastries or a healthier choice of bagels, fruits, yogurts, etc... We had a great experience during this trip and this hotel played a part in it.This quaint little hotel located on the long arm of Charleston's historic district makes the ideal spot for a honeymoon retreat with the man of your dreams. Too bad I was with my girlfriend. Because both of us had neglected to take off work for the remainder of my stay, (short story, we forgot) we became well-acquainted with the ups and downs of the hotel wifi. It was more down than up. But because it's not the management's fault that Time Work-sucker is as awful as it is omnipotent, I can hardly hold that against them. Oh, and the halls are something else. What a maze. A beautiful, wonderful maze that you should never get lost in at 2 in the morning when you've had too much to drink and you can't find your electronic cigarette charger but you're pretty sure you dropped it before you got to the elevator. When you wake up 15 minutes before your first meeting the next morning (thank you, central time, for that extra hour), the hotel's close proximity to everything makes it a breeze to stagger down a half-darkened stairwell and stumble through the humid streets with your eyes downcast because the sun hurts and your contacts are glued to your eyeballs, until you get to a cafe filled with elderly patrons who judge you behind their decaf tea cups, where you order two muffins, one blueberry, one cranberry, and the barista tells you to pick out two from the basket, you end up with two blueberry because you forgot about the cranberry, and water of course! Because that scenic tour and your hangover has stripped you of 80% of your body's water reserves, and then you head back to the wonderful Fulton Lane Inn just in time to join the meeting and rasp in your scratched, busted voice the work you did yesterday when the wifi was actually working. Oh and my girlfriend wants to add that contrary to what the guy at the desk says, the parking is free as long as you have the pink slip. Oh and she says Starbucks is located down the street if the internet really turns to sheeeat.Is this hotel older and smaller than many other of the hotels in Charleston- yes. But what it may lose in size it makes up for in charm, location and great customer service.I was a little weary because when I had called  months ahead to make our reservation, the woman on the other end of the phone was rather abrupt and (no offense) sounded quite old and frustrated with taking my reservation. When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly concierge, who was great to talk to and made wonderful restaurant suggestions. The continental breakfast was less exciting than we expected, a couple of danish and croissants, with choice of drinks- all delivered to our room each morning... but it was cute and provided enough sustenance to get us through til lunch.My husband and I booked the ""Discover Charleston Package"" which included a carriage ride (Palmetto Carriage), passes to the Nathanial Russell house, and our choice of Middleton Place Plantation, Drayton Hall Plantation and Fort Sumter. We enjoyed all of these, as well as some others over our 3 day stay! I highly recommend Fulton Lane Inn for it's clean rooms, great service and super close proximity to everything that you would want to walk to in Charleston!We felt that this hotel was an amazing value, it was less expensive than we expected to pay.I went to Charleston for an interview and had the pleasure of staying at this inn. It was so beautiful and you can have the free breakfast brought up to your room at no extra cost or you can go to the restaurant next door for a nice sit-down breakfast with the other guests.  Huge bathroom with jacuzzi tub, updated interior, pretty pastel colors in the room.  It felt like a step back in time or a trip to another continent.  I would stay here if you want a nice hotel right in downtown Charleston with a taste of old Southern charm.The location of this hotel is Wonderful! The room was a really good size and clean. There is a slight musky smell outside the elevators and rooms, but it isn't bad inside the rooms. Not sure what it could be, but make a really good carpet cleaning would help. The afternoon wine and cheese reception at the neighboring hotel was a really nice touch. Wish they would set it up in a bigger room and maybe have a second table of wine and cheese as the line and waiting time gets a little excessive right before 6pm. But I would suggest giving this place a try. I enjoyed staying here!We went to Charleston for our mini-honeymoon and chose Fulton Lane Inn based on price and location.  We came away thrilled with our choice and would definitely recommend it to others.  Here's why:1) the location is quite perfect, even though this wasn't terribly obvious in doing our research.  Basically, Fulton Lane Inn is right about in the middle of King Street, which is one of the main commercial streets of downtown. If you turn left out of the Inn, you are immediately amongst nice, quaint, boutique shops, antique stores, art galleries, etc., and eventually into the historic district.  If you turn right ouf the Inn, you very quickly are in the thick of the name brand stores (Kate Spade, Banana Republic, etc.), and then a few blocks more, you reach many very nice restaurants, bars, etc.  If you keep going further you then get to the type of restaurants that cater to college students.  So, you really have your choice, all within a 5-10 minute walk (or less).  Either way, on all of the side streets are cafes.2) the rooms at the Inn are large, comfortable, and reasonably priced.3) the staff are extremely helpful in making restaurant recommendations and reservations4) a note about the free breakfast: we only had it once, and it was fine.  Nothing amazing, but quite acceptable.  The reason we skipped it the other days was due to the number of truly excellent breakfast options in Charleston, which you shouldn't miss out on: Queen Street Grocery, and Jack's Cafe, should not be missed (both a 5 minute walk!).5) bonus points: very nice hot tub in our room. Nice touch leaving us a bottle of champagne when we arrived.If you come to Charleston (which you should), this place is a great choice.Fine Enough for Queen Victoria    Walk 20 steps up a narrow brick alley off King Street, in the center of Charleston's bustling upscale shopping district. Look carefully, and you can spot the  the unassuming door of the Fulton Lane Inn. Inside, in a space too small for a suitable lobby, an attendant at a desk checks you in. Inexplicably, she said we had been upgraded to a suite. We would be charged $159 for one night three days before Christmas (2012) and $139 for the next three nights--prices not much above those of the stucco-coated chains along Interstates 95 and 26 that lead into Charleston.  She handed us two solid brass keys that might have dated to the Civil War and dispatched us to the elevator behind her.      The hotel's 45 rooms are scattered off a maze of narrow corridors on the second and third floors. We stopped at the heavy solid wood door with an oval, no doubt hand-hammered, polished brass plaque of No. 338. This was no suite, and a room chart showed 338 to be roughly similar in size to most other rooms. But however jaundiced we might have been about hotels and their pretenses, this room blew us away.      The ceiling was 12 or 14 feet high. In the closet were two terrycloth bathrobes.  In the bathroom, a Jacuzzi and separate shower. On the counter, various amenities, including a towel to remove makeup, and two glasses--cut-glass glasses, not plastic.  In the bedroom, a working gas fireplace. The top drawer of an ancient walnut dresser opened to form a desk and on top of the dresser, a very wide, flat-screen television. Two sets of tall, wide windows, framed in fine thick fabrics, overlooked King Street. One set of windows enclosed an alcove extending far enough over the street to accommodate  a breakfast table and two Louis XVI armchairs.      The room, though well wired, wouldn't suit many a harried business traveler or families with young children. There's no microwave, refrigerator, real desk or swimming pool. But it has four or five places to nestle with a book or watch TV. The bedding might have been better.  The mattress was soft, and the pillows felt like marshmallows made of rubbery foam. The inn does not have a dining room--no loss with many of Charleston's better restaurants just out the door.  It does provide room-service breakfast, continental for free. For breakfast outside the room, you're directed to the adjoining, quite similar Kings Courtyard Inn--another of four downtown hotels under the same ownership and management as the Fulton Lane Inn.      The Fulton Lane Inn is 100 percent authentic. No flimsy plastic cups wrapped in plastic envelopes you get on the Interstates. It pampers you and commands and earns your respect. We'd go back anytime.","Wow!! Love this place. Would totally stay again. Nice clean room, free continental breakfast every morning. But enought to actually feed you :) newspaper, nice staff, charming old room. Honestly my only negative is maybe the water pressure in the shower... But seriously great view of king street. Just a really cool place!!I would give the Fulton Lane Inn more stars if it weren't so expensive. For almost $200/night, I expected more. The pros: Quiet room. Note that I was on the third (top) floor, the very last room at the end of the hall (room 339), so I didn't have people walking past, doors slamming around me, etc. Other rooms may not be as quite. Friendly staffFree wifiComfortable bed (king room)Great location right in the heart of the shopping/dining district. Walkable to anywhere downtownThe cons:Room smelled like urinal cakeBig wet spot on the stained carpet. Gross.No business centerSo you may be saying to yourself, ""Just three cons? That should warrant more than two stars."" Logically that's true, but two of the cons are huge to me (dirty and stinky), and unfortunately, combined with the cost, add up to a low overall impression. I wouldn't say avoid this place, but if you're spending $200 a night, you can probably find something better.We had a  large, beautiful room at the Fulton Lane Inn. You can't beat the location. Our room faced King Street and the enormous windows let in lots of light. We had a huge poster bed, so high off the floor that my wife needed help climbing onto it.  The wine tasting each day at 5 pm was excellent, as was the sherry that was put out in the lobby each afternoon. The service was excellent.We found a couple of shortcomings, though. Those windows that let in so much light also let in way too much noise from King Street. We heard people carousing until 2 am even on weeknights. They cleaned the streets both nights we stayed there. The cleaners make an amazing racket in the wee hours and then do it again on the other side of the street 10  minutes later. Frankly, I slept poorly both nights, constantly awakened by street noise. If we went back, I'd insist on a room at the rear of the hotel.My second gripe is regarding the breakfast delivered to our room and included in the room rate. The pastries were dry and sub-par for an inn this expensive. I ordered granola with a banana that was forgotten the first day. Worse, the granola came in a Kelloggs Snack Pack box. Seriously? A $300 a night room (after tax) and I get a little box of cereal from a kid's snack box? They could at least pour the cereal into a bowl instead of making me open the box. The breakfast belonged in a Holiday Inn Express.  (Sorry, I think I may have just insulted Holiday Inn Express.)We stayed here complimentarily, otherwise, I would have been a little angry with the cost:value ratio. The room was big, but it just felt empty and had a dusky smell (luckily we brought Lysol). We had a standard king, and unlike what was advertised, we had no view, no canopy bed, no whirlpool tub, no fireplace, and no cathedral ceiling. What we did have, and oddly the most obvious example of a ""bygone era,"" was a 19"" standard def TV which rested 20 feet away from the head our bed. We had huge windows...with blinds that wouldn't close all the way. Overall, I felt the building didn't have a cozy feeling; it felt empty and cold, mostly through scant decor. It just looked like whoever decorated didn't plan well for the high ceilings.  My wife and I had the continental breakfast brought to the room. It was pathetic. Two croissants, 2 muffins, and 1 cinnamon role (that was 2 orders), and that was the"" assortment of fresh pastries"" that was promised.  Last but not least, the ceilings are so high, the room is basically an echo chamber, and all the road noise (like the garbage truck at 5am) reverberated through the room all night. Also parking is $12/day, not included with the price of the room. Bottom line, if you need to sleep in downtown Charleston, and you like paying a lot for location with no value, this place is certainly ""charming."" If you want value for your money, you probably should avoid this one.",,,,"['cute', 'place', 'great', 'rate', '199', 'night', 'night', 'free', 'breakfast', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'breakfast',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-vendue-charleston,The Vendue,4.0,$$$,94,"Beautiful hotel! Very good location--super close to a lot of great restaurants, and an impressive display of art. We were there during the Silver vs. Gold exhibit, and got to see a ton of nice portraits and photographs. I had never really heard of an ""art"" hotel, but staying at the Vendue gave me a good idea of what it's about. Our room had a huuuuge shower--I had no idea that the extra space would make such a difference. The layout of the hotel is open--you walk through the lobby and directly into the restaurant (no doors in your way), and then there are parallel hallways, each side featuring different art. There's a coffee shop attached to the hotel, and another open space at the other entrance, also featuring cool art. The area with the rooms also features art, and most of it mentions a price (maybe that was for the exhibit? Not certain if that's all the time), which means that you might be able to take a piece home with you! When we went, there was a beautiful Christmas tree. They also have complimentary infused water (honeydew for most of our stay) at the lobby. The staff was very helpful. We were too early for check-in, so the woman at the front desk (unfortunately I can't remember her name, but they were all helpful) let us keep our bags with them while we went out to start exploring. She was kind enough to show us the surrounding area on a map, and let us take it with us. She circled some great spots, and we were not disappointed by her suggestions. True southern hospitality, plus art. As an art hotel, they had daily art/wine events, as well as milk and cookies each night. What a great idea! As tourists with no need to worry about working, we were happy with the internet service as well. I didn't try it on a laptop, so I may well have wound up using data, but I believe that the wifi was strong enough for us to complete most of our tasks (mostly just Google mapping where we needed to be).The Press. Unsure now how long they've been open, but long enough that I was surprised they were not popping up independent of The Rooftop at Vendue or The Vendue Inn when I attempted to check in via my Yelp app. So, and because folks may not know of it because it's somewhat obscurely hidden within the popularity of the aforementioned locations, The Press was part of The Vendue's revamp last year, basically an amped-up, Starbucks-serving,  grab-n-go sandwich establishment that is severely under-traversed each time I visit. Like, I'm generally the only one there when I go in, and it's way too bad because the interior is gorgeous and bright and offers free WiFi and a really cozy atmosphere if you're looking for that Starbucks counter feel without that Starbucks counter crowd. The thing with The Press is that despite a smart looking lunch menu, they do not always appear to have their entire list of menu advertised sandwiches every day. Today for example, they displayed only three of the five they advertise on their menu. Of course, for grab-n-go, you'd expect the preverbal tuna salad or ham on white, but not here...here we're looking at a short list of made to order and not your average grab-n-go's. When I walked in today, I was looking at a choice of their Grilled Vegetable Wrap with Crispy Rice Noodles and Peanuts, their Slow Roasted Prime Rib Sandwich with Caraway Slaw and a Horseradish Mayo, served up on a Pretzel Roll, or their The Italian with Cured Meats, Oil, Vinegar, and Roasted Peppers on a Rosemary Sea Salt Focaccia. I made some small talk with a new face behind the counter, and asked how the prime rib was. He responded with 'good; looks like a good amount of protein on that one versus the others.' Huh? Strange reply, but I thought little of it because I was starving, so I went for the Prime Rib. I swear it was because the pretzel roll was speaking to me from behind the display case! Their menu reads that all sandwiches come with a side. I placed my sandwich order, and then followed up with 'it comes with a side, yes?' My counter guy replied, 'yes...but do you want the side?'  Um...? Well, if it's included, and I'm paying for it either way, and my belly is roaring, then yup. I opted for the house made Tabouleh. Off went my ticket to the bowels of The Vendue for 10-ish minutes of prep and then voila! I was motoring back to my office with the bag of goods. My sandwich was killer; the prime rib was warm and moist and just perfect. The caraway slaw added crunch, and I was really glad for the choice. The Tabouleh was a miss with me, not hugely, just I wouldn't get it again; it was an outside-the-box attempt using fresh thyme and pimentos which I truly appreciated, but the couscous were overcooked or over-saturated with the oil and lemon. It wasn't so much the flavor as it was the texture. Tabouleh oatmeal. Just before the food was ready, I noticed they were able to do the crafted bevs just like I'd get at Starbucks, so I was eyeing a Frappuccino. I approached my counter guy again and asked which one he was fond of, and he abruptly blurted out that he didn't like drinking that many calories so he really hated having to make them when people ordered them. Good grief! First the protein, then questioning my opting for the included side item, now condemning a fav treat because of the calories I was completely prepared to burn, slaving away at my desk for the remainder of the day? Counter guy is a really poor salesman; thing is, he didn't exactly look like a personal trainer either...just saying. So after immediately diffusing my 'want' for a Frappuccino...and losing an additional $5 sale in an otherwise known to be slow venue, counter guy charged me $11 and change for my Wednesday lunch. $11 is average but not the best for my French Quarter section of East Bay Street. I do overall recommend The Press, but think The Press need to polish their staff a bit; less focus on the fat, more focus on selling the food!Has a boutique feel and the location is good. Resident artist Fred is a very interesting guy and quite talented. Overall the newly renovated hotel is comfortable. I'll just focus in on a few negatives because a place like this at their price point should be held to a higher standard:Internet signal in the room was not great, I had to sit outside in a common area in order to use my laptop. I was told after I reported the problem immediately after check-in that they would look into a possible solution, and nobody bothered to get back to me at all about it during my 4 day stay. It may have to do with all of the brick (we stayed in the 26 building) which while very nice to look at may cause signal problems. More routers are certainly needed.Outlet situation in the room was terrible. Outlets were hard to come by and located in very inconvenient spots. Not great for someone who has to work on a computer, but probably fine for a general tourist who doesn't want to bother with work anyway. They did offer a docking station for an iPhone 6 which was a nice touch and saved me from having to find an outlet to charge my phone at night.Nice touch to offer milk and cookies delivered to your room in the evening, but they should really consider offering non-dairy options for those that can't drink milk. I'm sure the coffee shop attached has soymilk so why can't it be offered? And again offer a work-around! If someone can't have dairy, why not offer them something different such as tea or maybe coffee...anything! Don't just tell them no we can't accommodate you. That is the difference between a hotel with good service and one that is great.Finally HVAC in our room had a major leak beginning at 4am on our first night. With water pouring onto the bathroom floor it was tough to sleep. While the problem was fixed the next day (we told the desk at 4am we weren't interested in changing rooms at that particular moment) the staff never followed up with an ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience"" which I thought was very poor. I'm guessing the problem was a clogged filter which probably means they don't change them out on a regular basis.Bottom line - nice enough hotel but certainly not elite when it comes to service. I would stay at the Charleston Place (been there about 5 times vs. this being my first visit to Vendue)for my next visit as I believe that they offer much better customer service. If the Vendue improves their guest experience it would be a strong option for future visits.After all these years visiting Charleston, and now 10 months after living here, I FINALLY get Laura up to the roof top at the Vendue! Her first words out of her mouth? Why haven't you brought me here sooner?!?! - I tried honey! But you kept pushing it off as not a place you were interested in! Ok, so let me set the scene. It's a late November Sunday, and the weather has been absolutely amazing for this time of year. The next day more better than the previous. We'd been playing tourist all day in our lovely little town and were in need of some adult refreshment; but with 2 requirements. 1, it had to be outside and 2, it had to be in the sun. What better place to go than the roof! It's both outside, and if high enough, in the sun! We got to the bar and unfortunately had to ask for a cocktail menu. Call me crazy, but I would think you offer your patrons menus up front, so they can make conscious decisions on what they want to order. After getting our drinks we walked around the roof top. They truly do have an amazing view of the Charleston sky line here. There's plenty of seating so you're bound to find someplace either in the sun or covered bar area to relax. We opted for a cushy seat on the side right in the face of the setting sun. I have to say, I really, REALLY liked the place. The only down side is that the servers buzzing around the place, didn't seem to pay us any attention at all. You would think that if you saw my drink half empty, you would offer to put in an order for me. So for that, and the lame bartender who didn't offer drink menus; I take away 1 star. Other than that, I HIGHLY recommend this roof top bar.We recently stayed three nights (my boyfriend and I) in 26 Vendue across the street and had a mixed experience. Both properties are gorgeous, interesting artwork, great location by Battery Park, etc. We used our car every day and took advantage of the valet. The immediate surrounding area is highly touristy. Valet parking is $20 a day. Service was hit or miss to be honest. The front desk staff were friendly and attentive, and even fetched us forks when we came back from a late dinner and a few boozy hours. Housekeeping came at odd times and one afternoon tried to clean the room after it had been serviced (we popped back in to change clothes). There seemed to be little structure to housekeeping on the side we were rooming. Notably, while checking-out, the bellman took his sweet sweet time retrieving the car even after we expressed we had somewhere to be. Our room was handicap accessible and the window overlooked a street/gravel lot. The exposed brick and the wood floors were lovely, but the room needed a little TLC. I don't know,  we were in a handicap accessible bathroom, but the shower stall was a definite letdown. Good shower head at least! And the robes! Noise wasn't so much an issue but it was present.We ventured to the rooftop for a pre-dinner drink and promptly left. The boisterous drunk college-aged guys made us turn away real fast. For all the talk about the rooftop it was eh, fairly common rooftop environment. We probably wouldn't stay there again. There are enough boutique hotels and such in the area.We came here on a Friday night after dinner, looking for some drinks/dancing on the rooftop -- and they were already closed! I couldn't believe how early they closed for a Friday night. It was disappointing but we ended up having a great time across the street on the rooftop of Grill 225.My (new) husband and I stayed at the Vendue for a week to relax/unwind after our wedding weekend. This was our first time in Charleston- very quick/easy drive from the airport. From the time we flew in - and flew out, it was pouring and very cold, which sadly was just our bad luck, but it meant we got to explore things in and around the hotel that we might not have otherwise (and it is a good excuse to go back)! The hotel did have large umbrellas for guest use, which was very handy, as this was not something we packed! We loved the  various unique artwork scattered about the property. I definitely wish I could have taken a few home!Our room was beautiful. It was just up the stairs and above the resident artist studio. Large/very cozy bed with a fireplace and large windows. The bathroom was a tad small and didn't love the shower (tub with glass wall made it feed cramped for me) - however no problems with functionality. The staff was great, welcoming and accommodating. They even sent us up a bottle of champagne on the second night to help us celebrate. We did have complimentary valet, and even a $50 credit to use at the restaurant or starbucks/coffee shop every morning. We didn't end up using all of it - as we only used it for coffee in the mornings, but it was a nice touch! The location was perfect - and we were able to walk most everywhere (even with the rain).At check out- minor issues with getting charged for valet (after initially being told it was complimentary), but they fixed it with no problem/questions before we even left for the airport. We definitely recommend and will hopefully be back!My husband and I booked a few nights for our anniversary and were blown away by the hotels amount of Southern hospitality! Originally,  I reserved one night for an Interior Queen.   About a month before our visit, I called to add another two nights but that room was already booked. For $20 more a night I could reserve an Interior King which was fine. It was reassuring to receive a confirmation email when I added nights to my stay.It was busy when we arrived at 3pm to check-in which is normal. The nice part is, they unloaded our luggage while we waited and informed us about the parking garage. The staff was so welcoming and helpful during the check-in process. When we were escorted to our room I was pleasantly surprised to see they had upgraded us to an Exterior King! It was a spacious room with a working fireplace, partial brick walls, beautiful wood beams, a closet, and bathroom with tub and walk-in shower. Way back when I made the reservation I mention it was for our anniversary, but I did not expect a bottle of champagne and two glasses to be waiting for us when we came back to our room the first night.  The second night we received chocolate covered strawberries and a card wishing us a Happy Anniversary. We felt very spoiled! The Drawing Room is an intimate dining room that features seasonal and local menu items. The smoked sweet potato ice cream was impressive. They also have a beautiful bar area with some upscale cocktails. Definitely worth the experience.  The hotel itself is luxuriously decorated and in a very convenient location near the water. During our stay consierge was glad to help us book reservations and answer questions about the area. At the 4pm reception, they offer wine and snacks while you mingle with other guests. Then at 9pm they offer delicious chocolate chip cookies and milk (they go quick). If that wasn't enough, they have a turn down service and leave little chocolates on the bed. We really didn't want to leave. But the checking out process was easy and quick, thanks to the competent staff who billed us correctly. It is exactly this kind of detailed service and seamless transition throughout our experience that makes this place so memorable.We stayed here recently and felt we got good value for our dollars.Pros:Great locationUnique propertyFree breakfast free wine/snack hour - People were very friendly and we met a lot of interesting fellow travelers!Great customer serviceRooms - There are two parts to the hotel - the main building with a beautiful marble lobby and bar and art gallery - This is where you go to access the roof top bar which was also nice.  This building is sleek and sexy.Our rooms were across the street in an older facility - Still very nice and eclectic but not as swank as the main building.  We had an inner room that had beautiful exposed brick walls and an old fashioned bed with ornate headboard.  However, the room didn't have any windows and that is not my favorite way to stay!  Nevertheless, we didn't stay in the room much anyway...had lots of sightseeing to do!  The wine and cheese hour was in our building.  There was also an artist studio who created art in our building.I recommend this hotel if you like historic hotels and boutique vibe.  If you would prefer more modern rooms, ask to stay in the main building.  If you want to save money and have a more eclectic environment, go for the second building.Wish we could have stayed longer!Yes, this place is on the expensive side.Yes, the building is old. (It's historic Charleston after all)Yes, you should still stay here if you want to vacation in Charleston. Once you arrive you will NOT need your car. Walk to countless amazing bars and restaurants or take the free bikes out for a spin up to the aquarium.You will be 50 ft from waterfront park which features fountains, gardens, and a huge pier complete with amazing porch swings. Stop for a Gelato on your way back and your night will be complete.Check out the rooftop bar, the exquisite original art (featuring an in house artist), and have some wine and cheese at the daily 4pm managers greeting.Turn down service at night, the best southern hospitality, and the best location in downtown Charleston make the Vendue the primere hotel in the historic district. We loved every second of our stay.Excellent location! Great southern hospitality! Complimentary coffee in the morning, wine and appetizers in the evening and milk and cookies at night, friendly staff and modern rooms with character, we really enjoyed are stay and the friendly touches. Would definitely stay again!We stayed here while dropping my daughter off at the College of Charleston. I found the hotel on Priceline at a fabulous rate. The hotel is beautiful and staff was outstanding! Our room was uber romantic, the restaurant was gorgeous and the bartenders were very generous with their pour. There was beautiful art work for purchase everywhere and even the resident artist painted during our dinner at the Drawing Room! My wife and I certainly look forward to returning to the Vendue in the future!What a fantastic hotel! This one has roughly 44 rooms on the north side and another 44 rooms directly across the street. From the time you check in, it seems that the entire staff knows your name, and addresses you by it every time they see you.The portion on the south side (where we stayed) is a four-story building, with the top floor being reserved for a very busy bar with supposedly one of the best views in the city. (We would have to say Charleston must not have many great views.) The bar seems to stay very busy from 4:00 PM-midnight, when it closes, and it's very difficult to find a table. The location is about as close to ideal as one could hope for, being 50' from East Bay, home of many of the hopping bars and restaurants in the city, virtually all within a 5-10 minute walk.The hotel's rooms (south side) are all different sizes, and floors are not level--the ""Charleston Lean"", as they say. (I thought I just had more to drink than I thought I had.) The hotel is not inexpensive, but it's worth a splurge. Only faults are 1) no safes in rooms, and 2) virtually impossible-to-find self-parking (we finally gave up and used valet).Nikki Zarzuela, the front desk manager, provided EXCELLENT customer service!  From start to finish, she really made a difference in accommodating our large party's needs. She is warm, welcoming, and works a genuine smile. The Vendue will be at the top of our list when we return to Charleston.Our stay at the Vendue was exceptional. We called the hotel before booking to get a run down of the different room options. There are two buildings located across the street from each other, 19 vendue and 26 vendue. We were told that number 19 had just been completely renovated so we decided to stay there. I asked about the room and requested a California king room and that we would prefer a corner room as that had four Windows and looked amazing online. When we arrived, we were greeted by a doorman who was exceptionally nice as were all of the staff at the Vendue. When checking in, they confirmed that they had reserved the room we requested so we went up to the room. Upon opening the door, we found a gorgeous room with fireplace and a brand new bathroom. It was very clean and decorated beautifully. The hotel is located along the river and close enough to everything the city has to offer. After spending a day touring the city on foot and or on the free bicycle they provided, it was nice to come home to the quieter water side area with a walking park next door. BTW, all of the bicycles appeared to be brand new.We only ate at the hotel for one breakfast which was delicious and not all that expensive. We did spend quite a bit of time on the rooftop bar which was staffed with very nice bartenders. The lobby area was just renovated and doubled as an art gallery. There is a coffee shop on the first floor that serves Starbucks, muffins and other such items.What more can I say...we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back to the Vendue.There was no one person that stood out, but rather the ENTIRE staff that was exceptional.   Unfortunately, we were staying at your hotel during the horrible rain storm from October 1 thru October 4th.   With the town being shut down, especially on Saturday, the entire staff overcame to ensure every guest was comfortable, fed, and more importantly safe and cared for.   We will definitely attempt another trip to Charleston, when the sun is shining, and when we do, we will be staying with you!Very mixed experience for us here. The short list:Pluses: -Location-Friendly check-in experience-Reggie, who showed us around and brought our bags to the room, was awesome-Roof top bar, despite the rain, was totally great-Lovely bathroom and bath productsMinuses:-We had an East Bay King. The view is worthless - you look out on a parking lot.-I'm highly allergic to down. Not only the comforter but the mattress topper were full of feathers. Had an allergy attack in the middle of the night that lasted 36 hours and severely bummered our vacation. Don't usually ask about this when booking hotels - I will now.-Front desk staff at check out was awful. Didn't even ask how our stay was. I was very disappointed in their work.Bottom line: too expensive for a Monday night in the off season. Would not return.A must stay!! Pricy but worth it... Excellent customer service, clean rooms, all updated.. Awesome rooftop bar to watch the sunset and moon rise..    Thank you to the entire staff for a great experience!! Will be back! Oh btw ""Ed"" was a big reason we choose this hotel! Great at what he does!!I stayed at the 26 vendue building but went in both. Great cute boutique hotel, very nice staff. Nice bar downstairs and casual rooftop.Ok so we came back here after I left a review saying we wouldn't. I thought it would be a great idea to give this place another go especially because I kept getting such great recommendations. It just still was overly disappointing. Again, when it comes to their customer service, they are amazing. They were super helpful when booking the room and went all out with helping me surprise my boyfriend by going and picking up Blenheims and cinnamon rolls to be in the room when we show up. That's amazing and would never expect a hotel to do that. Last time we were here there was construction across the street for the new building. Now that is all complete and looks amazing. Since I knew they were having a big New Years things at the bar upstairs I decided we should stay at the older location across the street where we stayed last time. Since we had issues with noise we thought it would be best to book an upstairs room this time. That didn't help. Now that the construction was done on the other side of the street I guess they were fixing up this building because every morning starting at nine they were construction noises that we heard, wouldn't be a big deal if they just told us because I would have booked for a room across the street. Also New Year's Day a practice fire alarm went off at 8:30am, not ok. Overall the rooms are just very badly insulated, everything from the room next door and in the hallway can be heard loudly, I could hear the girl in the next room peeing. We asked for our bedding to be changed and we left around 11am, we came back at 3pm with a little note on the bed saying that she was sorry but she had to throw the sheets in the laundry and will come back when it's clean. How does a hotel not have enough spare sheets. It was awkward to come back because we couldn't just lay around, so we left the hotel and went walking around even though we preferred to just relax. If this was a motel somewhere that I was paying $50 a night I would be ok with all these things but I do not believe that what we paid should just be for the excellent front desk staff, it should be for the overall experience.","We just came back from our first visit to Charleston and stayed at The Vendue for 3 nights. We picked it out because of location and boy, were we glad! It is central to everything - an easy walk South to Battery or North to Marion Square. Not to mention Waterfront park and the shuttle stop right around the corner!And the best part - you're literally across the street from the best restaurants in town!!! I highly recommend Cypress for dinner (upscale), Magnolia or Blossom for lunch or dinner, and Eli's for breakfast (two blocks East).We were shocked that all staff knew our name! I mean, these guys are trained well.. Bell boys, front desk staff, concierges from different shifts all greeted us by our name our entire stay! They gave us a personal tour of the hotel, took us across the street to show our rooms, and recommended great places for dining and ways to get around (we didn't have a car). Talk about customer service! We didn't plan to be in the hotel room much so we saved money by staying in the older building (Vendue 26) in interior room (there is actually a window but it's into the atrium, like many chain hotels so no big deal). The rooms are comfortable and bathrooms are renovated, it just wasn't our style. You fast forward three centuries by walking into Vendue 19 (across the street). So if you prefer an eye-pleasing luxury of a modern boutique hotel, splurge and stay at Vendue 19. That's the same building where the lobby, coffee shop, restaurant, and rooftop bar are located.Speaking of.. The rooftop bar is amazing! It's tiered so be sure to go to the very top. Great drinks and appetizers here!A great bonus of The Vendue is free Starbucks coffee at the coffee shop, complimentary reception (wine/hour d'oeuvres) daily 4-5pm and milk &amp; cookies 9-10pm. We indulged and loved all three!The hotel breakfast is good, but if you'd rather venture out of the building, we discovered an amazing restaurant/bar just outside the hotel, right around the corner! East Bay Meeting House is its name; it's open for breakfast from 8:30 and stays open late (after 10pm). Great European atmosphere in a small setting that feels like true Charleston. Try smoked salmon bagel with cream cheese, roasted peppers and capers. Out-of-this-world good!!!Amazing service! My wife and I visited in March and booked the interior queen room. We were celebrating our anniversary and upon arrival, the staff had upgraded us to a king room with a fireplace and windows (the interior queen did not have any!). The staff was very friendly, eager to help with any questions we had and showed the artist actively working on his art in a room within the hotel. The room was perfect, comfortable bed, beautiful brick in the room and fireplace. It was close to everything we wanted to see, especially since you want to walk when in Charleston. When we visit Charleston again, we will definitely stay here!Great environment. Unfortunately had a terrible service. We sat at the table upstairs near the bar. No one greeted us for a solid 5 mintues, so the boys went to the bar to get our drinks. 5 mintues later, with the boys still at the bar getting drinks (it was a packed bar), a male empoyee brinks us a drink menu. When the boys return, a server finally came over and said we are not allowed to sit there and order drinks from the bar. OK,  with us all being in the service industry (one an owner, one a manager, and all others bartenders) we understood and said we would transfer our tab and order all drinks through her, Breanna.Long story short, I ordered another champagne after I finished my glass my boyfriend got me from the  bar ($10). I had two more, so a total of 3 at the table. We get our bill and my drinks were $51 total. My boyfriend who doesn't drink and runs a bar asked her why my drinks were so high. Her explanation really ticked us off. She said that since we didn't specify which one, it was their policy to to pick that specific brand. Mind you that brand ($17 a glass) wasn't even on the menu!!! We know in the industry you always serve house or well unless the customer specifies. We spoke with the manager who fixed our bill and apologized for the service. If she is still there, just beware she will upsale you without even asking your permission.July 2014The Vendue Inn offers the type of service that I've never experienced before and may never again. Everybody is just so warm and inviting and truly interested in making sure your experience is the best. The hotel itself is beautiful, they have 2 separate buildings and we had a room across the street from the main lobby. I can't remember how old the building is but we were told about it while being taken to our room and it was fascinating, the building has a rich history. The room was beautiful, the use of the old brick walls combined with some updated features was stunning. And the bedding, oh I really can't say enough about it. It was so plush and comfortable. My husband and I wanted to write down the brand of the feather(?) bed to see if we could purchase it for our home, but unfortunately we forgot. We were upgraded to a fireplace suite, which was great until I tried to sleep. Unfortunately, that night it was extremely windy, so windy that the pilot light in the fireplace kept flickering and I'm such a sensitive sleeper that it made it difficult to sleep (we could not find a way to turn it off) .So my advice here is just if you are a light sleeper like me, you may want to opt for a room without a fireplace. Also, I should not forget to mention: LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! You can walk to basically anywhere in downtown Charleston and you are right by the pier. We would definitely stay here again.My husband and I just spent two blissful nights celebrating our anniversary at the Vendue Inn. We were pampered, respected, accommodated, given chocolates on our bed each night, a bottle champagne to celebrate with, and beautiful art to admire. I hope we have the opportunity to return some day!!We stopped at The Rooftop and had a few glasses of wine with friends. It was very relaxing and a great view of the city!I stayed at the Vendue Inn back in 2011 for almost 2 weeks when I moved to the area. I was across the street at 26 Vendue and chose to stay there again this time because it is a little bit less expensive than staying at 19 Vendue. When I stayed here in 2011 I had a beautiful large queen sized room with exposed brick walls and a bathroom with the same and a large soaking tub. There was also a wonderful free breakfast included for each night you stayed. Now, the Vendue is run by a different company and it's apparent. I'm not sure if they remodeled the rooms to make them smaller so they could fit more in, but my room was tiny this time. The bathroom, rather than being open and beautiful with tiny and dingy. The new management has also gotten rid of the amazing breakfasts for guests. They do still have hour's dourvs and milk and cookies from 9:00-10:00pm every night. While the Vendue has always been a beautiful place to stay, it now feels stuffy and pretentious instead of open and friendly. I would recommend staying somewhere else in town if you are looking for a romantic place to stay in Charleston.Always wanted to visit Charleston. Finally decided to stop by on a trip from NYC to Florida. After some researched settled on this hotel. No regrets. A bit pricey but beautiful rooms. Nice restaurant. Friendly staff. Great location. I will be returning.My fiance and I stayed at The Vendue for a couple of nights at the beginning of June.  They had just completed a big renovation and the place is beautiful!  When we got there, they had actually given us a complimentary upgrade in our room.  It was across the street from where you check in.  The room was great with a historic feel to it and very spacious.  Loved the rooftop bar with views of Charleston!  Loved the extra things such as turn down service in the evenings, a complimentary wine/snack reception each evening and a welcome note on the pillow when we arrived.Only cons - we had to wait a while to get our car from the valet a couple of times; also they neglected to bring one of our pieces of luggage to the room and we didn't notice until we were in the midst of getting ready to go out.  If we hadn't experienced these things, it would have been 5 stars.Unfortunately we had a very bad experience at the Vendue. The location was cool, go to the rooftop for amazing views. Food was okay at best and took an hour to get to us. People next to us left before their food arrived because of the wait. Service was so poor. The establishment did not prepare for the amount of people needing service. We had to go down two flights of stairs to order and the bartender was angry with us for ordering. She ran all over, snapping at people. The rest of the waitstaff was no better, giving attitude when we asked for help. Don't go here. Not worth the crap service.We stayed at the Vendue recently and it turned our trip around. We had booked several nights at the end of our trip because we couldn't afford the Saturday night rate, which may have been higher than normal due to the Wine and Food Festival going on. We had booked an Airbnb reservation for the beginning of our trip because it had a better rate, but it just wasn't quite ready to host guests to put it politely. Subsequently, we just didn't feel comfortable so we called the Vendue to see what our options were and even on a busy Saturday night they got us a room and worked with us on the price since they knew we were on a budget. I know we were lucky a room was open, but they still worked to get us a room (actually an upgrade from where we were going to be) that was comfortable, clean, and priced right. Harris helped us the most so you're in good hands with him, but everyone at the Vendue was extremely helpful and courteous. The location is also great for going anywhere downtown and still being just off the beaten path to have some quiet if you want it. And the little touches they provide round out the experience- complimentary coffee at the coffee shop, milk and cookies every night, getting to the front of the line to go to the rooftop when it's busy - and they add up to create a home-y experience.Overall a really nice place to stay while you're exploring Charleston and they'll do their best to take care of you. Will be staying with them next time I'm in Charleston.We stayed at this hotel for the first half of our honeymoon trip and it was very nice. We were at 26 Vendue, the building across the street from the main one. All of the staff was nice and attentive, and they had a bottle of champagne waiting for us in the room on our first night, which was nice. There is complimentary Starbucks coffee until 10am, complimentary wine and appetizers/cheese from 4-5 daily, and free milk and cookies 9-10 daily, all of which we took advantage of. They also gave us a food and beverage credit that we never used because we were too busy exploring the city. The location was very convenient and we walked everywhere. The only complaint we have is the thin walls in this building - we could literally hear the television in the room next to us, as well as conversations being held at low volumes anywhere around our room. Otherwise, a great place to stay.If you can disregard the facts that this hotel is staffed with amazingly friendly people and located just steps from both Waterfront Park and the City Market, then you're basically looking at your run-of-the-mill upscale boutique hotel.  But you know what, that's okay.  The room service was great, and it was nice to be treated like ""somebody"" for a few nights.  We'll be trying out the complimentary bicycles on our next stay!My wife and I stopped in for a late night dinner. We each got a burger and both thought it was the best one we'd had in a long time. Simple yet different and delicious. A surprisingly good meal just off East Bay. Service was stellar too.All I can say is WOW. The Inn is beautiful, charming and romantic. Order the Gendron croissant sandwich at breakfast and the Blue Ridge Manhattan from the drawing room bar made by Johnny. Alternatively, try his created drink, the ""docent.""  It is as delicious as appropriately named for a drink from this art-loving hotel.  The 4 pm wine and cheese reception is also not to be missed. Mostly though I was extremely impressed with how hard all of the staff worked to make sure the guests had a wonderful stay.  I will come back to this hotel again and again. Charleston is an amazing spot and this hotel is definitely la creme de la creme. It is worth every penny. Book it immediately.Vendue Inn is located in the perfect location of downtown Charleston. The staff was beyond pleasant and always ready and willing to assist with anything. The room was beyond charming, but I was a little disappointed when it came to the bathroom - I tried blow drying my hair and the outlet wouldn't work with it. There is a blow dryer that comes in the bathroom, which I also tried using, but did not work either. Ultimately I ended up using one of the outlets in the bedroom, which was fine, but a little inconvenient.One of the most fun things about being in Charleston is riding bikes. The Vendue Inn has bikes there to take out and enjoy the town with!In the morning you are seated in the Library restaurant for breakfast, which I was so looking forward to, but it turns out their daily complimentary breakfast is a pastry, if you want anything more than that you must pay for it.In the afternoon the Vendue Inn hosts a social hour for the guests that includes great wine and assorted hors d'oeuvres.You certainly shouldn't miss the delicious fresh baked cookies and milk that are served promptly at 9pm.Overall I really loved staying here. The location really added to its charm and I would love to returnMy boyfriend and I just returned from a wonderful trip to Charleston where we stayed at The Vendue. What a beautiful property, and in the perfect location to see everything in the downtown Charleston area! The staff are extremely helpful and the hotel is very pretty. They showcase local art in the area and have a small art gallery in the hotel where you can stop into and chat with the curator. They also have wine and cheese everyday in the gallery at 4pm and do fresh (delicious) cookies and milk each night at 9pm. Great hotel!Love, love, love this hotel.  Will not stay anywhere else in Charleston.  Location was perfect - on water, away from major touristy area yet walking distance to almost everything.  Staff was friendly.  Rooms were very pretty, clean and spacious.  No complaints whatsoever!This is a cute hotel in a convenient part of Charleston, but the money was not worth the hassle of dealing with management and staff, or the quality of the room we were given. I stayed here with part of a bachelorette party of 10, split into three rooms. Prior to arriving, the front desk staff had multiple problems with our booking - they somehow switched room reservations, cancelled one, and mixed up credit cards. After calling twice to confirm (on our own initiative - they never called me to confirm), they got it right. When we arrived for our stay, we made clear that the bridal party wanted the largest king fireplace suite room available, so that we could host events in our room. The front desk staff said that our group had booked two of those rooms, which were exactly the same, except that one had a private entrance. We decided that would work for the bridal party, and took it. The room did not in fact have a private entrance, but a side entrance to the building nearby that also gave access to several other rooms. More importantly, the other king fireplace suite was much larger than ours. After talking to manager Alex about the mishap, he said he couldn't do anything for us other than move our belongings to the larger room and give us a free breakfast, which was not what we wanted. We wanted an explanation for the multiple mix ups, but never got one.In addition to the administrative mishaps, the room itself clearly had recent spackling over holes, but was never painted over, which looked cheap. Yes, there were free milk and cookies at night, and the Rooftop bar has a great view, but those weren't worth the money. The only redeeming factor of the hotel was an employee, Crosby. He acted as our personal tour guide, coordinating car service and helping us sightsee/bar-hop. Find him, and he'll make your trip excellent. Otherwise, steer clear of this hotel, which was not worth the $350/night room charge.Did not provide  a5 star experience. First given a room without windows. I didn't even think this was legal. Then placed in a room that was not completely cleaned. Did they think we could not tell. The tv or cable did not work.Some staff helpful.Bikes for free but in need of repair.Not 5 star and yet snobbish","I'm giving 5 stars for the excellent service I enjoyed during my stay. When I arrived, the manager spent significant time with me to resolve a potentially costly issue I was having with Expedia. Service was also great in the general run of things - friendly bell service, valet, lobby greetings, bar tending, housekeeping, room service order. I chose the hotel for its great location in the heart of things. For that very reason, I'd worried that the nights would be noisy - but that was not the case and I slept great every night. Comfortable bed and tasteful furnishings in my room (215). Vendue was a warm and hospitable place. I'd come back.Best bed ever! The bed was so fluffy it was like sleeping on a cloud. We stayed in a interior room, so it had no windows which was great, so there was no beam of light waking us up in the morning. We liked the room so much we stayed another night. We even tried to stay another night but they were completley booked. The Rooftop Bar had some interesting cocktails but not much of a food selection.I stayed at the Vendue Inn for a recent trip to Charleston, and I had a great experience. When we checked in I was surprised to see that there was no big front desk like most hotels, but instead there was a small office room where you sit down at a desk and check in. Afterwards the bell hop gave a tour of the hotel as he escorted us to our room. We stayed in the King Suite I believe, I think it was room 202. You also have yo use actual keys to get in the room. It adds to the charm of the room, but it kind of sucks to have to carry around a huge key, and you can't keep it.I was very pleased with the room. I was afraid that the room might look old and dirty, since all the hotels in Charleston have a historical charm. But the room was a good mix of historical and modern. There was a fireplace, with a bottle of Sherry on the mantle. On the desk there were flowers, candy and champagne (I believe the flowers/candy/champagne came with the romance package). The bed was a 4 post bed with a canopy. There were steps on each side of the bed to make getting on te bed easier, but I was able to get on the bed without the steps. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had a hot tub and an individual standing shower. The room also had 2 robes in the closet and an umbrella that could be borrowed. The hotel also had complimentary usage of bikes, but I didnt take advantage of them. In the morning they have complimentary breakfast, Its not buffet style like most hotels, they actually seat you and take you order. In the afternoon they have a cocktail hour with wines, cheese, crackers and fruit. In the evening they have cookies and milk, which were soooo good. They also have an evening turn down service in the room.As for location, It is right next to the water and walking distance of the sights downtown.The staff was all very friendly and helpful.My wife and I stayed at the vendue for our honeymoon  and found it less than stellar. Rooms without fridges, microwaves, or windows. Walls that do not block noise. Cleaning staff that did nothing but make the bed and take out the trash (there was a film of dust throughout the room that they never touched, for example). Also, the vendue recommended a taxi service that ended up being over 20 minutes late to pick my wife and me up on the way to the airport. Cookies at night were stale...coffee was late or nonexistent, and never very good. Staff were friendly but unhelpful and gave us bad information about ways to get around Charleston that ended up costing us money and time. The room was worth far less than we paid. A holiday inn would have had bigger rooms, better amenities and better cleaning staff.They try to cover up these shortcomings with an upscale ambiance but it falls short. Don't waste your money here.Friendly staff. Good character. Attractive rooms. Good location. Fruit water when you walk in during the day. Milk &amp; cookies at night.Only cons--- Free bikes need to be better maintained. Shower curtain in our room was in need of replacement.My husband and I stayed here on a recent trip to Charleston for a friend's wedding. We really enjoyed our stay at this inn and here are a few reasons way:First off, location, location, location! I don't think there is a poorly situated place to stay if you are in downtown Charleston; however I particularly liked the fact that this place was right smack dab in the middle of all the great dining places and bars. It made going out and trying that delicious southern food that much easier :)Also, the service here is exceptional. The concierge was really helpful in scheduling activities and transportation. Being a bit Type A, I already had a few things planned before our trip (i.e. some dinner plans and activities). However, while in Charleston, the concierge was incredibly helpful in organizing the rest of our vacation (including transportation and reservations) so we could maximize our time in their fun city. I think on my next visit I am going to leave all the planning up to the Vendue folks :)Also, the breakfast (which is complementary) was better than I expected. I don't see why anyone would choose to pass this up! They also offer a cheese and wine hour along with milk and cookies in the evening. Unfortunately, my husband and I missed these, but there is always next time...Finally, this place is just so sweet. It has a very anitque-like, elegant decor. Oh, and if you are looking to get a great view of the city, check out the rooftop bar. My husband and I came here for drinks and appetizers one night, and LOVED IT. I hear that if there is a line outside, you can flash your Vendue room key to the bouncer and he will let you jump ahead...5 STARS :)Went over a month ago, so low season (don't know if it would've been as perfect during spring or summer). I called 2 days before our intended arrival date and asked if we could move our reservation to the next day, rather than charging us the full price of the room (hotel 48h cancellation policy) the manager happily changed the reservation and upgraded our room since there were rooms available.Staff and room were lovely. The complimentary wine and cheese in the afternoon/evening and the delicious (also endearing) cookies 'before bed' were a very nice touch. Complimentary continental breakfast was very good and a reasonable amount of food, in my opinion, but there were well priced extras if you were in the mood for something more substantial.Would definitely return if I ever visit Charleston, especially with low season prices!You couldn't ask for a better location..  Right in the French Quarter off of East Bay..  Close to everything!!  You can also rent bikes and bike around the whole city if you choose.  Will definitely be staying here next time we come into town.  Breakfast was AMAZING!!  I had a sausage egg and cheese croissant with the breakfast potatoes and my boyfriend had the chef's special which was apple cinnamon french toast..  Seriously it all was too die for!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  We had an interior room which was very clean and very cute.  Warning, walls are thin.. not bad if a normal couple are staying next to you, but if you get a couple fighting then you will definitely hear every word that is exchanged.  The staff was amazing and I was so sad to leave.. Can't wait to go back!  Our room with taxes was just over $200/night and $16/valet per day or $12/self parking per dayLOVE this place and highly recommend staying and experiencing the charm!Also, wanted to note that we stayed across the street, not in the main B&amp;B.  Not sure what the difference between the 2 are.This review is for Private gatherings only. The person responsible for booking the parties, Alex Krall, is not helpful or flexible at all. The views are beautiful, so they must not need the group party business. If you have a large expense account and a budget is no concern- I'm sure it's great.Great location, great service and fabulous interior decorating in the main hallways. The only thing that needs work is the valet situation. We circled the block twice and no bellman stood outside- perhaps an opportunity here to improve.An amazing hotel.  We stayed in the King's Suite.  It was rustic and charming.  A large king bed with little stairs to help you climb in.  Two chairs by a fireplace.  A jacuzzi tub which was just okay, but at least there was one.  Great decor with brick walls and an old painting over rustic furniture.  Truly an amazing hotel!  Fit nicely with the charm of the town.  And they also give you complimentary sherry!The only downside: the TV screen was dim and you couldn't turn up the backlight.  But I didn't come to Charleston to watch TV.Vendue Inn is a truly beautiful hotel with a ton of charm. We used them as one of three hotels to host our wedding room blocks for our out-of-town guests. They were flexible and so kind to work with through the whole process.I really appreciated that they didn't put me in a position where I had to formally guarantee rooms. Instead, we had an informal agreement that allowed me to hold 10 rooms at a time for my guests to reserve rooms at a reduced rate. Once those 10 were full, we could add rooms as necessary until the hotel was full. It was a fantastic, no-stress way to handle room blocks.The Thursday night before our wedding, we hosted a ""welcome reception"" at Rooftop Bar at Vendue for people who came in for the long weekend before our Saturday wedding. They were incredibly accommodating for that event; they were responsive and flexible as we worked out how we wanted to handle the bill for that night and overall just worked to accommodate anything we needed. In fact, that night it was incredibly windy and being in the wall-less part of the bar would have been uncomfortable. When we arrived, they'd taken the initiative to move furniture to the ""sheltered"" portion of the bar and created a lounge almost for us! It was wonderful.The only things that are a bit inconvenient are that they don't offer WiFi (just hard-wired Internet -- it's free, but slow) and the hotel hallways can be quite noisy. Overall - great experience working with them; I'd do it again anytime!Stayed here with my girl friends one night in Charleston.  The room was so cute and very unique.  The rooftop bar was so FUN and a must see, beautiful views.  The staff was GREAT.  If I ever go back to Charleston I will choose this hotel again.  The best part was the free bikes you can use for the day!  You check them out right in front of the hotel and can ride all around the city.  Everyone kept asking us where we rented our bikes and we told them they were included with the hotel.  I highly recommend the Vendue Inn and hope to make it back for another stay.I had been looking forward to our ""getaway"" for quite some time, making the reservations months in advance for dinner and a two-night stay, more than happy to pay the $350 per night rate with the impression it would be nothing short of an exceptional experience. Long and short of it, found The Vendue to just be a ""Meh"" experience. We could have saved ourselves the time and money on this one...Breakfast in the Library was lackluster. Sure, lovely chandelier, but the intrigue stops there. The service was in dire need of attention and the food OK. When I asked our attendant what type of bacon came with the eggs, her response was ""regular"" bacon. When I asked about the sausage I was told ""regular"" sausage. Are you serious? You have 12 items on your menu (at most!!) and you have no idea what you're serving? Here's a pointer... offer to find out. Coffee service yet another sloppy experience, pouring it with such rapidity that it sloshed on the table with some splashing on my clothes. Wow. I won't even touch the manner in which they cancelled the dinner reservations or the lack in communication on their part. After the breakfast experience, maybe a blessing in disguise.Now the room... another blah moment. Bed was clean, bathroom clean - nothing remarkable when I think back to more recent stays in hotels/inns/b&amp;bs comparable to The Vendue in cost. The room was microscopic and the noise level is significant, muffled conversations from other patrons filtering into the room as well as noise from outside.The location is OK - within walking distance of some nice spots. Then again, there are several other hotel options for consideration that are 1. Not as expensive 2. Feature more amenities and space and 3. Likely participate in sone sort of rewards program for us frequent travellers. Similar to other reviewers... sure, the cookies and milk are cute, wine and cheese hour a nice touch, but not worth the $350 a night.I teetered with the rating. If I could, would be A 2.5, but a 3 in my opinion too generous.In summary, I bid you adieu, Vendue. This is where we part ways.One of the best and secret places to stay in Charleston. It's right downtown and right off the water. Within walking distance to anywhere you'd like to eat. Really quick 15 min drive to the beach. Inn keeper was super helpful, very sweet, and great about offering local tips.  Brought us fresh towels and breakfast every day. Would absolutely go back here to stay.I didn't eat here, just came in for a drink. Really neat place. Very typical old charming Charleston which is great. The bar had good drinks and good prices. I would definitely look into staying here next time I stay in charleston.The Pros: Super helpful and friendly staff; great downtown location near the water; clean.  Breakfast included (nothing to write home about but it's warm and free).The Cons: Tiny rooms, lacking a bit of charm, somewhat noisy during the day.We got a good rate, however, so the price was right.  Not sure how much better in terms of price / quality one can do in Charleston.I can't believe I have not written a review for my favorite hotel in Charleston. I have stayed there about 5 times now, in a variety for rooms, and absolutely love it. From the  person helping with bags, to the front desk, to the concierge, everything about the Vendue is A+ customer service. Some people complained about the interior queen. The description is on the website-if you want a window, go pay 250 more per night across the street. The interior queen is cozy and well appointed, the regular queen is good, and the fireplace king is my absolute favorite. The last time we were there we talked to the front desk about room options for us for our upcoming wedding. Not only did they describe the best ones, they also took the time to show us. Oh! And don't forget about the afternoon reception and breakfast. Even though you have to join the loyalty club, they're still free (and delicious). Can't wait to stay again in October!Its surprising to see the mix of reviews on here for Vendue Inn as my experience was nothing like those posted.My Vendue Inn stay was probably  one of the best hotels I've ever had.  First of all, we got upgraded. Cha-ching! Beautifully decorated room located not on the main Vendue but across the street. It had a spectacular bathroom and a bed I want to take home.  They also have complimentary breakfast (which is not your typical sausage, eggs, bagel), free bikes to take around town, wine-happy hour, and milk and cookies.  If you go upstairs they also have a great rooftop bar!We switched to Mills for our last night in Charleston, and was thoroughly disappointed bc we didn't get that special attention from the staff.LOVE THIS PLACE and will go back again and again!Where do I even start? Let's see...-Breakfast included. And it's not skimpy. It's delicious, and the portions are more than a normal person could eat. And the coffee is delicious, and FRESH orange juice... the belgian waffles are fluffy and light, the eggs are cooked perfectly, and the bacon is thick and tasty. Yummmm-Cookies and milk at 9pm? Yes, please!-Service is PHENOMENAL. Valet parking, bell hops, waitstaff, cleaners, etc... all want to help you and keep a smile on your face.-The rooms. Who cares that there isn't a window? I didn't! The rooms are beautiful brick, some with modern decor and some are traditional old south decor. BEDS ARE AMAZING. Feather beds with fluffy pillows and comforter. And the bathroom is a nice size, big shower, good water pressure.-Great location. Could it get any better? nah. Right on the water and 1 block from the market. -CLEAN. Enough said.Can't wait to visit again!","I stayed at the Vendue Inn for New Years Eve, where we had a King Suite with jacuzzi.  The building(s) are beautiful and the location can't be beat.  But I found our room pretty dated and in need of an update.  I was especially disappointed with the bathroom, which looked as though it was remodeled in the mid-80s.  They got the big things (bed, tv) right, but still need to work on other upgrades before I'd stay here again.The location is really fantastic. Virtually 1-2 blocks away from all the good restaurants we dined in, a few minutes to the city market, rainbow row, the battery, etc. When we arrived, we were very warmly greeted and given a tour. The bellhop and young man at the desk were most gracious.The nice touches included ...- the hotel decor (gorgeous antique frames with old paintings in them, holiday decor and tree, fire places, mini lounge/library, breakfast dining areas had old-world charm)- rooftop bar/restaurant - offers great views of the city and I'm told they offer live music although no one was playing the night we were there.- complementary wine, fruit and cheese in the early evening- delicious and incredibly warm, freshly-baked cookies with cold milk in the late evening- bath salts in the bathroom- complementary wi-fi- complementary breakfast.- complementary bikes for the guests! Wish we could have explored the city via the complementary bikes but didn't have time!That said, the breakfast food was just OK (my husband's breakfast sandwich tasted a bit stale like it had been prepared the day before) and the service during breakfast could have been better (I was never offered more juice and my mother had to keep asking for re-fills for her hot water).Now the rooms. We stayed in the rooms that were part of the Vendue Inn across the street from the main hotel. I'm not sure how these rooms compare to those in the main building but we found our rooms a tad small and lacking some character. Grant it, these were rooms with queen beds so you'd naturally expect them to be small but it was all they had left. We could hear the room next to us taking a bath or running the shower. The view looking out of the bedroom window was rather off-putting (an unsightly power plant). But the beds were incredibly comfortable and the bathrooms were clean, sizable and very well-appointed. We did very much like the separate sitting area with fireplace that the Vendue across the street from the main hotel offered. They also offer coffee and an impressive assortment of hot teas during breakfast time in this area.Would definitely return but would opt for a larger room.One of the best hotels I have been to. Vendue Inn doesn't have a check-in counter, but they do have something quite unique, a check-in desk where I sat down and received warm welcome from the staff. The bellman then showed me the way to my room. This is different from any hotel I stayed at before. Our room was with hardwood floor and exposed brick wall, the bed was comfy. I especially like the spacious bathroom. At night it was quiet and I had a wonderful stay there. This hotel is located a little away from the busy side of the downtown center, it is about 15 minutes from Charleston Place which is surrounded by many restaurants. This hotel is steps away from the beautiful waterfront park.Vendue Inn is a quaint and stylish inn right next to Waterfront Park in downtown Charleston. The free breakfast is very good and ranges from cold cereal to full fledged pancakes, French toast, or omelettes. There is a wine and cheese hour in the afternoon along with milk and cookies in the evening. My wife and I had a queen size room that was rather small but very 19th century decor. Being a large man (6-2 275) I would probably use a king size room next time, although a queen size would probably be fine for a man smaller in stature.The highs and lows of the Vendue combined for a solid 3 rating with my husband and I constantly answering the question, ""would you come back?"" With ""yes, but..."" The highs: the valets. Always attentive, friendly and ready to help. The staff in The Library and at breakfast: helpful and knowledgable. The Director's Reception: if you get there before the food runs out. The location: within walking distance of everything--park your car and forget about it.The lows: THE ROOM: exposed brick wall rendered the bathroom cold. Fixtures didn't match and the paint job was sloppy. Housekeeping: the price tag from a previous guest was still on our floor at check-in. Trash wasn't emptied on the second day. We felt like the room wasn't throughly cleaned. Wireless didn't work at all in our room. We could have wireless if we went to the lobby.A beautiful place to stay. Gorgeous rooms and very comfortable beds.  Extremely  helpful, friendly, competent staff.  The Roof Top Bar was a great place to gather at the end of the day. Best martini ever! And in the morning, we were served a delicious breakfast. I will definitely be back and will recommend Vendue Inn to all my friends traveling to Charleston.  Thank you for an experience I will remember for a long time.This was one of the best hotel experiences I've had in a long string of hotels. The staff were friendly and eager to help. There was always someone at the concierge desk, so no need to hunt someone down for service or information. Housekeeping service was good. The room wasn't huge, but plenty big for us. It was quite modern in spite of being in a great historic building. There was even a whirlpool bath! The buildings are really nice. Because these are old buildings, nothing is cookie cutter which makes it much more homey setting than a large hotel where every corridor is the same as every other. There are nicely decorated, compfortable little seating nooks scattered through out. Milk and yummy chocolate cookies were put out in the reception areas every evening. Since it was my birthday, they sent a bottle of champagne to the room! The inn is in a great location right down near the harbor in the French Quarter with easy access to the best restaurants and sight seeing. The Library Restaurant was a little out of our price range, but we did have a very nice breakfast at the Inn. We loved it!Well... I'm forced to write my review here since <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> refuses to post the review I sent them weeks ago.  Let's just start by saying that, my wife and I decided to go to Charleston, SC to celebrate our 4th year wedding anniversary.  Based on the reviews in that same website, we picked the Vendue Inn to stay during a long weekend between 6/25/10 and 6/28/10.  I sent an e-mail in advance asking staff to give us a quiet room, away from elevators and main entrances.  They responded back saying that they could show us what they had when we arrived.  The fact is, when we did arrive, this apprentice of concierge, Tim, greeted us with the customer service skills of... well, I can't seem to find the right word for it.  He told us we had been placed in a room across the street (not in the main building, and with no elevators), and when I said I was told the day before that we would be shown the different rooms available, he said ""well, this is the only room we have for you"".  Knowing myself, I just bit my tongue and did not keep pushing the issue.  We were tired after driving from Miami, and we just wanted to take a bath and get some rest.The room was tiny, nothing like the pictures posted in the website, and the ridiculous thing was that, having asked for a ""quiet room"", we soon found out the ice machine was a mere 10 feet away from our door.  So, throughout the weekend, we could hear people getting ice pretty much every half-hour, even during the night.  The icing on the cake was that the last two days, they put someone with a dog in the room next door... I lost count of how many times I had to call the main building to have the situation taken care of.On the bright side, the restaurant and the restaurant staff were outstanding.  We had dinner our first night there, and they treated us like royalty.  The food was out of this world, and the service, just impeccable.  Specially Charity, our waitress: the sweetest girl, ever.  Also Matt, who waited for us in our last breakfast there, was outstanding.  There was, however, this clear disconnection between the restaurant staff, and the rest of the hotel's.  It looked like the latter have never been training for customer service, ever...In sum, an OK place with an outstanding restaurant, but very poor customer service level in the hotel's staff.  When staff in any establishment look at you like you are coming from Mars as soon as you complain about anything, there is something definitely wrong with it... And like I said in the review that <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> never published (no wonder we got ""lured"" into this hotel by looking only at good reviews...), I do recommend the restaurant, but I DO NOT recommend the hotel.  There are far better places in Charleston, SC to stay in.  I won't deny that the Vendue Inn has a great location, but sometimes, that's not everything one could be looking for.  I rather be treated like a real customer, and not as an ""inconvenience"".  For sure we will never go back there...My husband and I enjoyed a romantic getaway at the Vendue Inn.  The staff could not ave been more helpful in attending our needs - a truly personal touch.  Southern hospitality at its finest!Small B&amp;B feel. It's like staying with family. They don't use the word ""no"" here. They go out of their way to make sure your trip is perfect.Planning on visiting Charleston for a summer wedding, I found Vendue Suites on another site listed as a B&amp;B. We wanted to avoid the typical antique and lace-type B&amp;B; this place was more of a relaxed apartment rental, with all of the amenities of a B&amp;B! Of only three units in the building, we stayed in the one-bedroom, which had great big windows that opened to Vendue Range, right off of East Bay St close to Waterfront Park. When we arrived, Jean did an excellent job welcoming us with a tour, a fully stocked room of food (including wine in the mini-fridge!!), maps and tips on where to visit and the best ways to get there. Our favorite part of the location was that the (free) trolley picked up and dropped off right down the street from the Suites; you could visit anywhere in historic Charleston from the trolleys, which saved us many sweaty walks.  There is coffee, juice, cereal, and pastries in the room for breakfast, and only a short walk to some great restaurants (check out Magnolia's and Poogan's Porch), the local market, and bars at night. Other reviews suggested that there was a bit of street noise at night, but we never had a problem. The price was a bargain for the great service and stocked room. If you are planning a trip to South Carolina, make sure to call Jean and stay here! I will be back!This place capped off our recent ""Southern Tour"" (Savannah, Hilto Hean, Charleston) and proved to be a fantastic base for touring beautiful old Charleston.Location is absolutely perfect (although the late Friday night noise from the Rooftop Bar across the street may prove distracting; bring some earplugs). The room overlooking Vendue Range is where we stayed - but the other two rooms would work well for two couples or a family of four (they have full kitchens).Jean is a gracious hostess that really will make your stay enjoyable - and she's a fun person to talk with.Not to be missed: Fleet Landing, tours of local gardens, walking E. Bay and King Streets (stop at the Bull Market), have dinner at Magnolias.Have fun!Was a great central location to explore Charleston and definitely had an old world charm.  The room was a little small, but the bed was very comfortable.  Not a great place to stay if you want to sleep in.   With the hardwood floors you can hear everyone walk by your room.  However, the staff was really nice and the brunch in the morning was great.  The best part was that they have free use of bikes to explore the area.  Definitely would stay here again.Very nice bed and breakfast in the best location to stay in Charleston. The breakfast was delicious, plentiful, quick and the service was excellent. The hotel had more to offer than we could enjoy. Complimentary breakfast every morning, wine in the afternoon, milk and cookies at night and free use of bicycles to explore the area. The hotel also has a nightly turn down service where they'll bring you ice, bottles of water and chocolates. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. We stayed in a King Suite. The bed was fantastic, such a good night sleep. There was a flat screen television in the bedroom and a larger flat screen television and fireplace in the suite. The shower was small and hard to get the water temperature just right but there was also a nice tub and an abundance of towels. We loved this bed and breakfast. Honestly this place spoiled us and caused us not to take a chance staying anywhere else when in Charleston.friendly, accomodating staff with good service.  they can get you reservations at restaurants around town.nice breakfast and wine&amp;cheese hour &amp; the oatmeal cookies at night were really good. great location with good restaurants and fountain park/pier nearby. riding bikes around Charleston is a great way to explore.rooms are nice but try to stay in the main Vendue not across the street where the rooms are small and everything can be heard through the walls. pretty old bathrooms but clean. very comfortable beds.price can get a little high but maybe because we were there during a festival.I want to give this place 5 stars, but the parking can leave something to be desired. My room was amazing. - It was very well appointed and the most was made of the space. I booked an interior room as I was only staying for the night. I was on the second floor, though the room did not have a window there was a skylight, which let the natural light into the room. The floors in the bedroom and bathroom were beautiful old hardwood. The bathroom was modern with a jacuzzi tub/shower. The staff was amazing- they were friendly, they were concerned, and they went out of their way to make sure my stay was enjoyable. The food was good, I enjoyed the complimentary breakfast. I had a glass of wine at the Manager's reception and I wish I had remembered to go for the evening cookies! The location is great- right off East Bay, right by waterfront park. Close enough to walk to all the great shops and restaurants. I would highly recommend Vendue Inn for a stay in historic Charleston.Capture the essence of Charleston while feeling at home at this beautiful Southern charm.  My room was a quaint step back in time and extremely comfortable.  Breakfast is scrumptious, and the service is wonderful.  Milk and cookies served in the evening are a real yummy treat and a nice touch    There is a rooftop restaurant that frequently has live music.  Waterfront Park is just outside the door; it is a locally cherished spot downtown for strolling, enjoying the sunset, and harbor gazing.Looking back at my books I realized that the Vendue Inn double charged us for an extra night. It's been too long to dispute the charges, but I'd definitely check your statements!  We were charged a full 267.76 more than we should have.  LAME.nothing but good things to say here...staff was beyond awesome, room was great with ton of character, hot made to order bfast in the morn... old world southern charm at its best. Warning...if the W is your idea of awesome, this isnt your place...if history, charm, and the staff making you feel like an old friend is something you might want to try...then this is it.  btw- location...perfect. great coffee house around the corner (the meeting room) and great eats close...cypress and snob!Wish you could give 3.5 stars...because that's right about where the Vendue Inn is. Pretty good by not amazing. After hearing from everyone we had to have a drink on the roof deck, we were disappointed to see how casual it was with with old furniture and people smoking everywhere.Hotel itself was nice, we found the staff very helpful (we had to move rooms because of a crying baby next to us) and you can't beat milk and cookies every night in the lobby!","We arrived at the Vendue on Aug 5th for a 2 night stay, and was greeted by the warmest attendants you could imagine.  They parked our car and we didn't see it for the next 2 days because everything we wanted to see or eat was within walking distance. Our room was nicely appointed, but rather small for our tastes. If you sit on the sofa to watch TV you have to look up at an angle which eventually started hurting our neck because the sofa was only about 5 feet away from the sofa and over the fireplace.  Bed was comfortable and inviting. My problem was finding german roaches in the bathroom, the kind you usually find in a dirty restaurant.  They immediately upgraded us to another suite.  The upgrade was very nice, and newly redecorated.  However we also found roaches in that suite also.  But since we were leaving the next morning we stayed the night without asking for a room change.  Breakfast was just ok nothing to shout about.  I had the croissant with sausage, and potatoes.  The potatoes were bland and not freshly cooked, but they were rubbery and barely warm. They should  try making fresh potatoes not frozen.  Overall our stay was good, and the staff was accommodating, but I don't think I'll come back..We stayed here last week to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary. We loved the location, it was in walking distance to most everything we wanted to check out. Robbie was a great help in getting a hard to get dinner reservation for us, but one thing I could not overlook was how I felt we were treated by the manager. At the wine and cheese reception she over looked our table  after greeting everyone in the room and did the same thing at breakfast the next day. It does not seem like a big deal, but did make me feel a bit strange and didn't lend itself to the warm hospitality I was hoping for being in the South. Our room was beautiful, but I felt that it was not as nice as it could have been for paying well over $300. The free bikes were awesome and my hubby and I enjoyed a relaxing bike ride around the downtown area. Overall, not what I had hoped for from a hotel that bills itself as ""catering"" to guests in a romantic setting.Pros: great location, excellent service, has the feel of a small intimate inn, comfy beds, good breakfast, and the afternoon wine tasting is a nice touch. Cons: the queen rooms are very small (we were in the building across the street); walls are thin and you can hear everything in the hallway; the plantation shutters let in tons of light in the am, which is not great if you want to sleep in; and the down pillows are terrible. We used a special on Expedia and paid about 2/3 the normal room price, which I think was about right for what we got. I wouldn't have been happy if we were paying full price.So I'm giving the Vendue Inn 4 stars mainly because of the great location and the good service.  Let me start with the check in.  So, probably my fault but I had booked and ""interior queen room"" - NEVER BOOK THAT ROOM!.  When we were brought to the room by the bellman it literally looked like a jail cell.  There was enough room for a queen bed surrounded by brick walls.  NO windows!  Talk about claustrophobia!  Anyway, we called the front desk and they moved us to the King Suite which was a huge upgrade.  Unfortunately we were staying for 4 nights and they didn't have a room available all 4 nights so we have to move to a jr suite(really a regular room) half way through our stay.  They were very nice about it and the poor bellman came back to move all our stuff.The rooms were nice, bathrooms outdated, but comfortable beds.  Very quaint and definitely old world charm.  I think you can't really avoid the ""old world charm"" in Charleston.  The location was great.  Right downtown, walking distance to restaurants and bars and right on the harbor front.  For the money I would stay again and recommend to others.The benefit of staying at the Vendue Inn is that it's one of only three downtown hotels that allow pets.  I've stayed several times and the first few were in the suites and it's okay.  The rooms are a good size in the suites but I got a queen last time and it was about the size of a large closet with a 19"" TV to match.  The floors were dirty and the bed was uncomfortable.  So why would I give it three stars?  Because the staff, location and breakfast are very good.  If you enjoy traveling with your dog then this downtown hotel is the best value, just opt for a suite.  If I go without my dog I like the Doubletree at Market St.Listed as a ""B&amp;B"", but more like a vacation rental, this well situated suite was a great home base for our weekend away. We are not big fans of B&amp;Bs- as the owners generally seem to be too involved and we enjoy more privacy, but this place is much more like staying at a good friend's apartment. The Inn was steps away from the river and just off Bay Street. We had the suite located on Vendue, The bed was comfy, the room was light and airy and supplied all of our needs comfortably. Jean, the manager, greeted us out front and directed us to the public parking garage nearby. We had wine, cheese and crackers waiting in our room and best of all were the bikes available for our use. We sure made great use of these - Charleston is too big to walk everywhere but perfect to ride through! Small drawback- the hotel across the street has a hopping late night bar that was quite noisy- drunken girls screaming in the street in the middle of the night- yikes! Another odd thing that I think is more about Charleston than this lovely Inn is a strange smell that seems to come up from the sewer- oh my! It actually woke us up in the middle of the night. Imagine each of us staring at the other thinking it was some ""bit of undigested cheese"" of whatever. It is an old town and all but damn! BUT, I cannot fault the Vendue Suites for that and we would be happy to stay here again.Great little inn.  Charming, amazing location, pretty rooms of a good size with amazing beds, nice amenities and bathrooms.  The breakfast that's included is so good you'll want to jump for joy, but the delicious cheese grits will weigh you down so you don't fly away.  Amazing staff, fun little wine and cheese reception every day, good value, nice joint.  Will definitely go back!My Husband and I recently went to the Vendue Inn for President's Day weekend and we absolutely loved The Vendue Inn as well as Charleston, SC.  Between the wonderful staff that is super hospitable (always a warm smile, eagerness to please, so professional and so darn nice;-), to the deeelicious Full Southern Breakfast each morning, to the awesome Afternoon reception (the crab dip and chicken salad dip was soooo yummy), to the big ole cookies and milk each evening and finally to the too adorable for words Charleston Chews with nightly turn down service each night, we have never experienced such luxury, romance, kindness, beauty, and delicious gourmet at ANY resort and we travel often to many different destinations.  This is hands down the best Bed and Breakfasts we've ever stayed.  The Bed was so posh and luxe, the room so romantic.  They leave no stone unturned and we can't wait to go back.  It's our new favorite Bed and Breakfast, ultra-luxurious and our new home whenever we visit Charleston, SC in the future.  In fact, we are now considering relocating to Charleston, we loved it so much and The Vendue Inn plays heavily on that decision.  We loved everything about it.:)I am an experienced traveler and I have NEVER encountered such a rude, arrogant, unaccommodating staff as when I visited the Vendue Inn.  I traveled to Charleston for a girls trip with 5 other women and we booked our trip through Expedia.  When making the reservations we purchased 2 identical rooms each with 2 queen beds and there were to be 3 people per room.  When we arrived at the hotel we were pleased with the charming decor and were excited to see our rooms.  As the bellhop took us to our friends room we went inside and it was just as we expected, 2 queen beds, lovely decor etc.  We were then taken to the other room where my mother, sister, and myself were to stay.  The room had only 1 king bed, was poorly decorated, and was dark and dingy.  We were disappointed and informed the front desk that we were supposed to have a room with 2 queen beds.  The AGM on duty, Jerry, was the most arrogant, condescending, egotistical person I have ever come across in the hospitality business.  He told us that when we reserved our room through expedia that the 2 queen beds were merely a request, not a guarantee.  Our itinerary specifically stated under Room Type:  2 queen beds.  I've booked through Expedia several times and have NEVER had this problem.  Why would we be expected to know that this is only a request and not a guarantee??  Jerry then offered us an aero mattress which we declined since we did not travel all the way to Charleston and pay for a room at a boutique hotel to sleep on the floor on an air mattress.  He then informed us that there were no other rooms available and that the hotel was 100% booked for that night.  We then offered to stay in the room for the night and then switch rooms the next day when a larger room became available since asking 3 adult women to sleep in one bed is absurd.  Jerry did not accept this offer but told us he would be happy to SELL us a larger room.  He expected our party to have to pay for a larger room when the hotel was the one at fault and we were the ones being inconvenienced.  Our party told the staff that we would be going to lunch down the street and asked that they have something worked out when we returned.  As we were in the middle of our lunch Jerry came into the restaurant and sat down at our table and told us that since there was nothing they could do for us then they were ASKING US TO LEAVE THE HOTEL!  Not only were they asking the 3 of us that were unhappy with our room to leave but they were asking the other 3 women in our party to leave as well!  Jerry told us several times that he didn't need our business because he could sell our rooms in an instant and that he wouldn't be paying for our expenses at another hotel either.  The entire time he was smug, condescending, unapologetic, and not to mention unprofessional by showing up at our lunch to embarrass us!  We then asked to speak to his manager, Sue, and he informed us that he was ""just as important as her"" and there was no need.  We eventually convinced him to get her on the phone and although she was unapologetic and  unsympathetic with our situation as well, she did offer to pay the difference for our stay at a Holiday Inn.  At this point we were so defeated and in complete shock that we had just been kicked out of this hotel that we accepted the offer for the Holiday Inn.  They were not even willing to find a hotel of comparable value and character.  Someone looking for a charming boutique hotel will obviously be disappointed when having to settle for a generic Holiday Inn!  This experience completely overshadowed our entire trip and our idea of southern hospitality.  The managers at this hotel are in the wrong business since they are obviously clueless about customer service.  I am still in complete shock about how we were treated and by Jerry's behavior as an AGM.  If the Vendue Inn is at all concerned with improving their customer service and making their guests happy they will never accomplish anything with Sue and Jerry in charge.  They repeatedly blamed us as well as Expedia for the situation and accepted NO fault of their own.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this hotel as long as both of them are still employed there.Vendudes in khaki, pleated as all hellThe Vendue is a pretty classy historical joint, with vintage elevator and all.  I wanted it to rule, but the ayes didn't have it.  Nice big patio on the roof and plenty of cocktails, but some displeasing building blocked the bulk of the view, tragically.  Didn't stay there but they tell me it's nice.  In short, a good place for a mojito if the no-see-ums aren't out in force.Let me start by saying that the bedding was by far the most comfortable I have ever experienced. The king-sized bed was amazing! Staying here had a number of excellent perks: conveniently located along the Charleston waterfront; free cruiser bikes; free WIFI; express access to the rooftop bar; and they have free breakfast and a afternoon snack (both of which we never tried). I had a chance to visit a few other rooms in three of the Vendue buildings. Our room was located in the main building and was the nicest of the three. IMHO, I'd say go for the main building. The room was quiet and well-cooled. The staff, while kind of young, were friendly and helpful.Great location. Amazing breakfast!  Get the biscuits and gravy.  Not too big but oh so satisfying.  Staff friendly, but concierge seemed to be having an off weekend. We stayed in fireplace room across the street next to the pub.  Great bed and bedding! Big bathroom. Missed the cookies but would definitely recommend as an alternative to the chain hotels in the area.First the good: 1. location was great just off of Bay St.  Many of the recommended restaurants are within a couple of blocks.  Having said that , several other b &amp; b's have good locations as well. 2.  Then there is the breakfast.  My wife and I love breakfast and the Vendue has just about the best we've ever had.  The orange juice , cheddar grits , and sausage were fabulous... they have excellent healthier fare as well.. but for a spluge, it was great ( We didn't need lunch, just came back for the wine and cheeze at 4:00). 3.  The staff was very attentive from check in to check out. 4.  Free bikes to cruise the city.  My kids and I checked them out  around 6:00 one evening  and ventured up to the College of Charleston and back down to the battery.  At that time , the traffic wasn't bad and most folks drive very slowly anyway.  This was one of our favorite parts of the trip as we just took our time through some of the residential areas .  5. Decor overall was very ""Charleston""Now the not so good: 1.  Beds.  Our mattress was not that comfortable; we felt like we could fall out.  2.  The room only has blinds on the windows, and the light woke us up before seven in the morning.  They need black out shades.  3. One more comfortable chair in the room would have been nice.When we came in the spring, our b &amp; b was less expensive , but the breakfast was basic, so if you eat lunch the cost is a wash; there wasn't the staff that the Vendue has, but the room was just as nice  and it was convenient as well.  Overall, the Vendue Inn is a great  place, and we will be back.The view was lost. Now it's found! The bar lost it's original view because of new condos but they built up and the view is back. Drink prices are reasonable and the appetizers are filling. This place draws in all different types of people but the one thing they seem to have in common is that they're local. Strange for a hotel bar, but it's true. No worries about it being outdoor during the winter.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/belmond-charleston-place-charleston,Belmond Charleston Place,4.5,$$$,139,"We were in Charleston this past week for 5 days and had the most lovely stay at The Belmond Charleston Place. Everyone at the hotel was tremendously friendly and helpful and the facilities were excellent! Our premier room was clean and spacious with plenty of storage space in both the bedroom and bathroom. Housekeeping was so professional and diligent, always making up the room (even when we left after noon) and providing turn down service in the evening (even if we didn't head out until 9pm) without us having to call down.  Complimentary waters are a nice little touch.  The bed was SO comfortable and there is a nice big walk in shower. The bar in the lobby of the hotel (Thoroughbred Club) is a great spot to have a drink and listen to live music nightly! Try the sorbets they offer there!!We hope we are fortunate enough to return to Charleston and the Belmond sooner rather than later.What a delightful stay!  Christmas at the Belmond Charleston Place was heavenly.  The entire place is decorated so nicely and there is just the right amount of hustle bustle going on in the lobby.The small touches made such a big different - like the fresh fruit in the room when we arrived and every single person we encountered in this hotel went out of their way to say hello and make sure we were taken care of - from the moment we wet foot in the hotel to the moment we packed up and left.  (A special shout to Reilly Williams - she was the first person we talked to, always had a smile on her face and was very helpful with everything we needed.)Also I have never been to a more dog-friendly hotel in my life.  In three nights there we probably saw at least 20 dogs.  We brought ours and were greeted in the room with doggie treats for her, which is such a nice touch. The location is also great - within walking distance to all the good restaurants and shopping.  We will absolutely come back!Belmond Charleston Place is strategically located in downtown Charleston in the midst of preserved architecture and landmarks full of Southern charm and a rich history. I felt right at home the Belmond. The rooms are large and spacious and the bathroom is to-die-for with rainfall shower head. Let's not forget the hand-blown Venetian chandelier set between a Georgian open arm staircase. This hotel is full of grace and charm, baby. As Rhett told Scarlett in Gone With the Wind, ""I'm going back to Charleston, where there is still a little grace and civility left in the world."" I'll see you soon, Charleston. The only issue I had with the Belmond is that the Internet was down it seemed each of the three nights I was there and making it harder for me to get work done as I have to write while i'm traveling. Other than that, it's awesome.Location, location &amp; location. Belmond located on the corner of the Meeting &amp; Market. The most convenient in Charleston, SC. It is next to Gucci and Luis Vuitton and all. Room is nice with two double bed. Bathroom had only shower, though with rainbow thing!Service personal cleans during the day and evenings they bring water bottles and ice to the room. I think that's very nice.No coffee machine or HBO. All the shops are on Kings St, restaurants are on Market St.Walking all the way Market you meet the Water Front Park.Just nice.Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Perfect location centered in all the hustle and bustle of downtown Charleston shopping. Service was impeccable at both hotel, brunch, and coffee stand. Speaking of coffee, it isn't included in your room. Nope. You have to go downstairs to a coffee stand (more like a miniature coffee shop inside of a closet), stand in line, and pay. Thankfully they accept room charge as I was not expecting this. And I personally prefer to acquire my coffee while in pajamas and wish unbrushed hair. Parking is not included either. Two things that should definitely be included with the price. Room was absolutely gorgeous. I could live in that bathroom. Well appointed with marble tile and rainfall shower. Had a view overlooking the courtyard, which was nice as well. Will have to try the spa during my next visit!I've stayed here many times over the years, and my most recent stay was very nice. The staff here always seems to be top notch. Great staff is SO important for a successful property. Everyone made it a point to say, ""hello, good morning, have a great day."" From the front desk, housekeeping, restaurant to the valet all of my staff encounters were great. Charleston Place is very well located on the peninsula. North of Broad, close to all the shopping, dining and the Historical sites. My sister and I shared a beautiful room, which the bellman informed us was newly renovated. It reminded me of the rooms at The Plaza in NYC! My parents had a suite and it was well appointed and also renovated. Another nice perk is the self park garage.Gorgeous southern hotel. We got the pleasure of staying here for our trip in Charleston, though it's a bit on the pricer side.Location is ideal, in the heart of downtown Charleston with boutiques inside the hotel as well as the street right behind such as H&amp;M, Forever 21, Urban Outfitter, Aldo, Jcrew, Rush, and much more... some high end stores like Gucci and Louis Vuitton, and some local boutiques as well.  In front, you have the city market with numerous eateries and specialty shops like the peanut shop, which I recommend visiting.For parking, there's valet for $32 or self parking in the deck for $16. When you enter, you are welcomed by a gorgeous lobby with a huge bright chandelier.  Just like the lobby, rooms are spacious and lavish, with a pinch of southern touch.  Bathroom was nice and clean, which is the second most important checklist when traveling.  In addition, they offered 2 rain shower, which was great. Everything in this hotel was great, but the best part of this hotel for me was the salt water pool on level 4.  It has retractable roof, letting in actual sun light and salt water like your typical spa pools.  Only downfall for me was that I did not plan and did not bring a swimsuit that I did not get to take the full advantage of it.  Don't be like me and plan ahead to take a dip in the pool, when staying here!Oh, and last thing, check out is 12PM~The location for this hotel is great! Walking distance from everything..!The first room we checked into was stinking of smoke. We went back to the reception desk and they replaced it quickly. Our new room smelled fine, and was decorated quite nicely. But for some reason we had expected larger sized rooms after looking at their website photos. Being on the club floor was a good decision we made because their club lounge has great snacks and drinks. The pool at the hotel was large and fun to hang out in, including the jacuzzi. The lobby is beautiful! We would definitely stay again, now with calibrated expectations.Gorgeous hotel. Perfect walking location to any activity in the city. Centrally located. Respectful and fast service. Club level has great complimentary breakfast, happy hour food, and evening drinks. Would definitely recommend the club level if possible.If you aren't looking for an Inn or a bed and breakfast, options are limited in Charleston. This is a solid hotel/resort option. Nothing was particularly great or awful about it. The service was nice, and the rooms were clean. There are connected shops, a restaurant, a bar, and an upscale cafe (which I also have a review on).Because of this and other amenities like the gym and pool, this is a good place to stay if you plan on spending a lot of time in the hotel.Exceptional staff, beautiful rooms (watch out for adjoining rooms, they can hear you &amp; you can hear them) don't get a room with an adjoining room. Nice bathrooms, beautiful pool area and spa. Meals in the courtyard and great food.Follow my rock &amp; roll reviews<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FWww.vinylclubamerica.com&amp;s=2d0ba0a80bb26df204eaa4250efbf2a154a12cf957440d09d4a8dcf4730ab543"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Www.vinylclubamerica.com</a>Stayed at the hotel, it's a nice hotel, but for the money, your money would be better spent at the Spectator Hotel, just a block down from Charleston Place, in Charleston, South Carolina. The rooms were nice, however the bathrooms are small. Yes the hotel as shopping and a few restaurants, but the Spectator is more   Then happy to get you anything you may want. The service at the Spectator gave us 3 butlers to fulfill all your needs and request. I wanted special water in my hotel room, the butler ran and got it at no extra charge. Wanted food delivered to my hotel room from a restaurant near by, they ran and got it.  Ordered tickets for a Ghost Tour, they ran and got it. The bathrooms are much larger too and the rooms also come w/Nespresso machine. Lots to be said about a smaller boutique hotel. One thing the Belmond failed to tell you, if you're handicapped you can park for free in the Parker garage. Other wise your paying $34 a night or $36 for valet parking.  Spectator doesn't charge you to park your vehicle. Besides that you're greater w/open arms and a cocktail the minute you pull up to the Spectator. Don't get me wrong the Belmond is nice, but when I head back to Charleston... It's the Spectator baby!  5 star treatment there...OMG, I LOVED this hotel.It was amazing!  We were upgraded to the Concierge floor.  Let me tell you, it was awesome.Snacks, desserts, drinks, tea, coffee, water at your fingertips at all hours.The beds were SOOO comfy.  I could have slept for hours.The service was perfect.  Every single person we encountered was so nice.  Hey Y'all.  Anything I can do fo y'all.  It must be a southern thing...hehehe.The pool/lounge area was amazing.  So relaxing.  Retractable roof, lots of lounge chairs, salt water pool, hot tub, etc.The only complaint I have is there is a small gap by the door so if people are being loud in the hallway, you can kind of hear it.Lastly, it is in the HEART of Charleston!  BOOM!  Walking distance to everything!Staying here now and really love the hotel and location. I stay in Charleston once a month but never here. The best part is I walk out of the hotel and am surrounded by all the good restaurants, bars, shopping and a Starbucks.All the staff are really nice and helpful. The bar is cool with couches and a piano. People staying at the hotel can sit down and play piano.You can look up the price so I won't post it here. The rooms are nice but you are paying for hotel staff and location. If you are doing Charleston for the first time you should stay here. It will allow you to enjoy what Charleston has to offer and you are in the middle of it.Beautiful hotel in excellent location close to shops and restaurants! My husband and I walked 2 blocks over and found several great places to eat. The rooms are beautiful and clean/comfy! We'll definitely be back!This hotel is gorgeous and I would definitely stay here again.  We were here for two nights in early January, and got upgraded to the Club level (I can't imagine many travelers that time of the year) so my experience is for the 7th and 8th floors only.  Rooms are very spacious, and the bathroom is HUGE.  I love large bathrooms and this one definitely did not disappoint (extra bonus, toiletries were all L'Occitane!).  My only gripe would be the bed, which sank in slightly, but otherwise I had a lovely stay.  I didn't realize Belmond was a chain until watching the video they put on during turn down service, but I will definitely keep it on my radar if I ever travel to the other cities they have a location in!Lovely hotel with a motif fitting old Charleston style architecture and style. The hotel is part of the Belmond elite luxury travel organization.  You will not be disappointed.  Friendly staff, spacious rooms and common spaces, and opulent furnishings move this hotel in to the top tier in anyone's list of options if you are going to charleston. I had a conference but due to other business conflicts I was only able to be in town for 24 hrs.. I squeezed in some local food and window shopping as well as eating conference food prepared by the hotel.  Their catered dinner (at the famous gov. Aiken mansion) and their ballroom breakfasts were very good.  The dinner included an oyster bar, bbq and other favorites.  If I head back to charleston I will think twice about staying anywhere else but this hotel! Ps had a room with a balcony over some shops on market street.Great hotel, all the high end features of a Four Seasons or RitzService is great, the people have a wonderful attitude.  Location is prefect if you want to site see or shop in old town CharlestonThis is a seriously upscale hotel. I have stayed here a number of times over the years and it's consistently great. The condition of the property is A+. Small things like complete control of every light and lamp in the room from your bedside make this hotel special. The room service was unbelievably quick.The service from the staff was always attentive and enthusiastic. I would like to criticize it but there just isn't anything I can think of other than the price. But it's worth it!My now fiance and I stayed at this hotel when we got engaged in Charleston this past June. We stayed on the club level and it was overwhelmingly awesome! They had food and drinks available basically all day long and the food was delicious! The pool area is very unique and I recommend you take the time to lounge for even a short time there. The best thing about this hotel is that we got to bring our dog! Everyone was very friendly to him and the hotel introduced us to a petsitter service for while we were out. I loved my experience at this hotel so much, I'm now looking at having my guests stay at the hotel for our wedding! The one thing I would say, is not to expect the most modern of hotels, the carpets in the room are a bit funky but I think it adds to the whole feel. Do yourself a favor and spring for the club level!","I was here for a convention. The hotel is pretty nice, but the wifi/wireless coverage is horrible!!! Completely inadequate for hosting an event like this. Could not get any work done because I couldn't maintain a connection.Lovely updated suite. Too bad the construction in the hallways is a tad noisy. But we love the service, the bed is divine, the new decor is very sumptuous, and the carpets are plush.Gorgeous old hotel in the heart of the Charleston peninsula. They are going through some renovations in the hotel, but I think they're nearing the end of the last round. We got a really good deal - or so I'm told - based on the fact we were staying in one of the older rooms. Who knows what will happen when they're finished. From the bellman to the front desk to the maintenance man, everyone was so nice &amp; helpful. We had one little snag with one of the housekeepers on our last day, but other than that we loved our stay. Check in was a breeze, the suite with adjoining rooms was gorgeous. Any time we needed anything the service was prompt. They have a spa/fitness center on the fourth floor. I didn't make it to the fitness center, but I did take a dip in the saltwater pool. It's on the roof, yet indoors with an open roof so you get the benefit of being inside, but can still get a bit of sun. And it was heated (I'm assuming) so it was easy to jump get right in. They have a bar on the roof as well so you can grab a bite or a drink if you wish. Lots of shopping around the hotel as well. There are shops lining two different sides of the hotel leading you out from the lobby into the streets. You'll find the high end Louis Vuitton, but also some more affordable options as well. There's a little coffee window that's open in the morning with coffee &amp; tea as well as some pastries. I became good friends with the barista as I was up before most of my party and was the one going on the morning caffeine runs. Couple of Pointers:  - Main entrance is not on Meeting Street. It's in the alley-way with a covered turnaround.  - Opt for self parking. They lease the parking garage from the city that's next to the hotel. If you self-park, it's half the price vs. if they do it for you.The hotel is beautiful, the rooms nice and comfortable and very well located. We were right in the center of it all, shopping, dining, ect. We had a lovely stay and the staff was very nice. Definitely one of the best hotels in Charleston if you are looking to stay in the city amidst all the action.Visited the spa in October, had a lovely experience!  The pools and lounge areas were small but relaxing and the staff was very attentive.  I got a pedicure, which was well done and my technician did a phenomenal job.  She even gave me bandaids and ointment for my blistered feet (I did a lot of walking)...  I worked with the spa in advance to arrange for a cake to be brought in and for a table to be reserved at the pool, and I found them very accommodating and helpful.  I'd highly recommend this spa.Absolutely love this place.  It is glamorous, the rooms are spacious, the service is impeccable and it is very central. With it being my first time in Charleston, I did not know what to expect. Went with a large group and everything from check in etc was seamless!My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in late May of 2015. It was our first time actually staying in the downtown area of Charleston and the location couldn't be beat. I had bookmarked a variety of restaurants via Yelp and all of the restaurants were within walking distance. There is also the fantastic French Quarter Market that sells a variety of goods just down the street from the hotel.My husband had opted for the Club Level, but upon checking in with our dog, we were notified that no pets were allowed on Level 8 due to the food that was served there. Understandable. Thanks to our dog, we were given a spacious suite on the third floor. The room was absolutely gorgeous and one of the largest hotel rooms that we have ever stayed in. Everything was in tip top shape.I would highly recommend upgrading to the Club Level. The breakfasts that were provided were so filling, with a variety of options, suitable for everyone. Unfortunately we missed Afternoon Tea during our visit, but the options looked fantastic! There was also a hosted open bar with all of the free drinks you'd like accompanied by a surprising amount of hors d'oeuvres. I had to reign myself in as to not spoil my dinner!My husband and I also signed up for an 80 minute couples massage at the spa. Lindsey and Thelma were lovely and made us feel so welcome. Sophie at the reception desk checked us in and out in an efficient manner and upon inquiring about a product that was not sold in their specific spa, she was able to provide an outside recommendation. I wouldn't hesitate to return to the spa!Now that the pros are done, there are just a few things that I would like to note that didn't make for a 5-star stay.1. Towards the end of our stay, it seems as though the AC went out and the room eventually reached temperatures of 80 degrees. We called down a few times, but unfortunately the engineer couldn't figure out what was wrong. It was an unpleasant surprise after having spent the entire day walking around hot and humid Charleston.2. When trying to get to the club level on both of the mornings that we were there, our key cards didn't work as they were supposed to. This involved having to go down into the lobby, correcting our key cards, and then going up to get breakfast. Obviously it's not a huge chore, but when paying as much as we did for the extra access, I'd like for things to go smoothly.3. Housekeeping didn't bother to visit us once while we were there. The only tag that we had hanging from our door was the one to notify the hotel that there was a dog in the room. I'm not sure as to whether or not we were supposed to remove the dog from the room during the day in order to allow for housekeeping to come by? If so, we weren't notified of what housekeeping rules are when it comes to having pets.Overall, this was a fantastic hotel that was a relaxing retreat. The staff is absolutely fantastic. This is a hotel that I wouldn't mind returning to for our next trip to Charleston.The location and the room were pretty Baller.  Three minor gripes, which could be deal breakers for some 1)the hot water in the shower was lukewarm at best (I'm a scalding shower person, so this sucked terribly); 2) you can definitely hear the hallway noises; 3) one of my towels had a definite lipstick stain on it. (I'm a stickler for quality control ;))There is a parking garage right next to the hotel, which is reasonably priced and the attendants are incredibly nice.  The hotel pool is amazing.  The staff were polite and friendly. Overall, I would not stay again-the hit water issue is my deal breaker.  If that's not an issue for you, I totally recommend!yes five stars from me.  staff, facility, location all top notch.  very accomodating.  Never had such attention to detail, especially from turn down service.  Hotel is up to date with USB charging stations in rooms, upgraded lighting panels, luxury shower..on and on.  I thought i was going to have an issues since i was hauling a a trailer and needed to self park..no problem.  Bell man took my keys and expertly tucked my vehicle and trailer in the self pay lot.  returned the keys to my room when done.  The lounge was great.  Bar staff very friendly and making drinks that spot on.  This is my new place to stay.  Keep up the great work.Lovely hotel. I stayed here for a work conference for two nights.The people at check-in were very nice, and very accommodating. The rooms are quite pretty and sizable. There were two TVs, and the bathroom was large and nice. Big sample toiletries too :)It's great that there are stores attached- Pandora, White House Black Market, Godiva, and more. I didn't get to go to the pool or gym, but a coworker said that they were very nice. The bar area also looks beautiful. The one bad thing about this hotel was the wifi- it was tough to get work done for the conference due to the incredibly slow and unreliable internet :( It's also a great location- walking distance to stores and restaurants. I would love to return!i travel a lot and i must say, belmod charleston place was one of the TOP hotels i've been too.  it is located perfectly in the middle of the downtown charleston.  it's perfect walking distance to everything.  right across the street from the outdoor market place and numerous restaurants.  everyday i walked a different way and found places to visit and eat and drink (a lot of bars).in regards to the rooms, they are gorgeous and clean.  they service your room twice a day, which is very nice.  they bathrooms were clean, the shower is huge and even have the shower head directly on top of the ceiling, similar to a waterfall.  all your light controls are right by the bed so that is convenient.  meeting space was huge as i had a few conferences there - but it was nice.  no issues or complaints.  definitley will be back to this hotel when i come back. charleston is like a hidden gem, this hotel is the pot of gold!This is a great hotel. Especially if you get the club level rooms. We stayed on the newest floor (8th) and the room was top notch - decor, comfort, amenities. Service was exceptional throughout the hotel. Everyone was helpful and friendly. When you stay on the club level there's a lounge with drinks and food throughout the day. Definitely recommend that. Location is great - near the design district. I would go back to Charleston just to stay at this hotel.This hotel is truly amazing, from the location to the ambience, the rooms and the staff. This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. When I come back to Charleston this will always be the place I stay. Shout out to Jake who gave us an incredible room and Ken, Edward, Francis, Amanda and Neshawn for outstanding service. This hotel is a must.yBeautiful hotel, amazing service and the club level is the way to go!  We are definitely coming back soon!Love this hotel. It's located on 3 major streets in Charleston... Meeting St, Market and King.  Great location!! The staff is very accommodating. Austin, the waiter in Palmetto Cafe remembers you and is greatly helpful in suggesting all types of local restaurants.  We will be basing out of CP for my daughters wedding in April 2016 so it is important to establish a good  relationship with a hotel and its staff.Beautiful hotel, excellent service and ideal location. I stayed at Charleston Place for a work meeting and extended my stay for a short family vacation. We absolutely loved it. Although it's a posh hotel, they were extremely family friendly, and on the few rainy days we experienced, it was very helpful that this hotel is part of an indoor mall so our daughter could burn some energy walking the halls. The hotel is right in the midst of a shopping hub, surrounded by tons of great restaurants, and also a short walk to Market Street and to the waterfront. Free wifi is also a bonus.I can't begin to say how wonderful this hotel is!  My husband, puppy Khaleesi, and in laws just spent 5 days at the Charleston Place hotel and we will never stay anywhere else but here in the future.  Our accommodations were luxurious, beautiful, comfortable, and spacious. We were traveling with our 15 week old golden retriever puppy Khaleesi so there was some anxiety about her being so little and staying in a foreign environment.  From the moment we pulled into the hotel everyone treated us, and Khaleesi, like family.  The bell men played with her every time we went in and out.. Madeline and Suzanne at the front desk gave her belly rubs and snuggles every day, even the housekeeping staff couldn't help but to pet her and love on our baby.  She was given a bag of treats which she thoroughly enjoyed!  They also offer pet sitting services to hotel guests... a definite plus in our book! Its funny how many times hotel guests said that seeing a dog in the hotel made their day. If you have a dog that you are traveling with you HAVE to stay here.  I am from SC and have been traveling to Charleston my entire life.  This is my first time staying at the Charleston place and the only downside is that I didn't stay here sooner.  Thank you to everyone at the hotel for making our early family Christmas vacation wonderful!!  You are truly an awesome group of people!What a beautiful hotel in the heart of historic Charleston. We enjoyed our 4 night, club-level visit and will be back. The hotel is beautifully decorated, with a bar and restaurant and several shops on the lobby level. As soon as you step out the door you are at The Market and within walking distance to shopping, restaurants and museums. The Club-level has spacious rooms that are very comfortable with excellent staff who understand that attention to details and perfect service matter. You will never go hungry while staying on the club floors 7 &amp; 8. From breakfast to desserts there is an almost constant selection of food to be nibbled. Breakfast was up and down. The pastries were fresh and yummy, but the hot food got old and stall. The Spa and Fitness Center are nice facilities. I enjoyed a spa pedicure with a glass of champaign and then met up with my husband for a couples massage. Our services couldn't have been better. They offer valet and self-service parking. There is a cost for both.They charged me 16 dollars to mail me a pair of pants I left behind.  It only cost a few bucks to mail.  Felt gouged.  I would not likely stay there again.  There are better places to stay in Charleston. There is s lot of pomp surrounding this place, but I think I would have better stayed at a place which was more personal.  Unimpressed.Fabulous location, amenities galore, service that can't be found anymore, stay here! Worth every penny.","Beautiful hotel.  But beware of items being taken from your room.  I checked in a week ago and my IPad was taken from my room.  After working with security I became VERY disappointed as they did not seem concerned. Of course the hotel security director was out of town and could not help.  As if today still no resolution and no concern about my theft.  My company spent THOUSANDS of dollars at this location.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.Beautiful hotel with lovely accommodations  (if you get an updated room... My sister was not happy.)  We must have gotten 5 new key cards made since we kept misplacing ours.  Front desk staff was extremely nice.  Roof top pool was very clean and super cool with the open air glass ceiling.  The entire staff was so friendly!  Maintenance, bell hops, room service, EVERYONE.  So nice!!!Loved the spa and pool here. Its a salt water pool with bar and jacuzzi. They do have showers  and a dry sauna. My husband and I got a couples massge from Joshua and Trinity. It was so relaxing. He found all my knots and took the time to work them out.This review is strictly for event planning.  Beware the not-so-bright Star.  I attempted to plan an even with a specific budget.  I was told my budget would be adequate to plan my event.  After our initial conversations, she managed to miss the point twice.  I finally just sent an example of what I was looking for only get an event planned for me that was an additional $100 per person which was way out of our budget.  I'm sure the event would have been amazing.  It was disappointing to work with someone who seemed to have no clue how to plan an event.  Good luck.Our third time staying here. This time we were upgraded to the Club Level, as they had over booked the lower floors. We will now definitely book the Club Level in the future!The drinks, snacks, etc. are better than expected, and more than make up for the difference in room fee.Only complaint, is the same as every other visit we have had here. The pool, although beautiful and salt water, has been ""temporarily closed"" at least one of days during each stay. If you are booking a place in Charleston that has a pool, I'd look elsewhere, as you may have very disippointed children/adults. The location is central to everything, the service is impeccable and the rooms are spacious and very clean. We will continue to return to Charleston Place in the future, (I retired last week) but will be prepared for a pool that's a 50/50 chance of being open.Nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. Loved the rooms, loved the bathroom and the abundance and quality of the towels (literally gave me 8 cushy towels to myself), loved the gym and was disappointed I didn't get to try out the pool or the spa while I was there. Free wi-fi in the rooms. Staff was friendly and helpful. Close to tons of restaurants and bars, and so much shopping. What a luxury!We came for Easter weekend. The hotel is absolutely perfect except for the very loud air conditioning unit in the room. (467). They sent someone up to fix it but it was the same after the fix. Bring your white noise!This hotel is absolutely stunning. The room was impeccable and very beautifully decorated. Definitely five star service all around. Can't wait to go back to Charleston and stay at this place again!The room and hotel are beautiful. The staff were friendly and accommodating. I was less than pleased at the nickel and diming to death. My husband and I booked a room for a relaxing weekend. We were placed in a section undergoing renovation. That's fine but the noise level was absurd. We ordered two drinks to the room and our tab was $60 for a double crown and coke and a skinny margarita. I knew it would be pricy but I've never paid anything near that. What put it over the top was the room service charge at the pool bar. Let me say that again ROOM SERVICE CHARGE AT THE POOL BAR. Are your freaking serious?!?! I have no problem tipping, at all. People should be compensated for good work; however, charging me a 20% room service fee when I am sitting at the bar is insulting. Shame on Belmond. All of the ridiculous fees ruined my husband's experience. I am slightly more forgiving because I made the reservation. Unfortunately we will not be repeating our stay, back to the Vendue it is.This is a little out of my own price range, but is my parents' hotel of choice when they are in Charleston, so I have stayed here with them a good 4-5 times.  It is very fancy, well-located and clean, and they also accept pets - surprising for such a luxurious place.  We have always come here with our dogs and the staff has been very nice to them.The food here is quite good.  They have a very tasty breakfast buffet and have a very charming ""tea time"" in the afternoon where you can get cookies and nuts and drinks.  The lobby has marbled floors and an elegant look and it attaches to some indoor shopping corridors.  Walk outside and you are right in the market area.  Inside, they have a grand staircase leading up to a computer and meeting area as well as very nice and clean bathrooms.  Much better than the bathrooms on the first floor that sometimes has lines because of shoppers walking through.I'm a little bothered by the parking here - the choices are valet or to park yourself in an outrageously overpriced garage.  But I guess since it is smack dab in the center of town the parking options are limited.A good option if you want something elegant and classy in the best possible downtown location, and are willing to shell out a little extra money.Gorgeous, Southern hotel. Beautiful, newly decorated rooms with very comfortable accomadations. We had a little problem which the staff immediately addressed and even overly compensated for. We appreciate this very much. This is truly a lovely place in the heart of Charleston. My whole family loved the salt water pool with retractable roof. The attention to detail by all the staff was appreciated by my family. We would love to come back again someday.The hotel is beauitiful,employees gracious,food was delicious.The problems began the first night of our stay,the airconditioner was broken.Our second night we were awakened at 2AM by dripping water from the ceiling,by morning the carpet outside our bathroom was soaking wet.We have now had maintenance twice,would you not expect a manager to call and make sure everything was ok.Keep in mind we were on there top floor paying a $50.00 a night premium for a brand new room.On our third evening we now had not one but 2 huge leaks in the ceilng that were now entering the bathroom floor making for a slippery situation , a few hours later we once again had no airconditioning.For a hotel of this class not to have checked  in with their guest to make sure the problems had been taken care of is absurd.I stayed here for a convention that came to Charleston and I was not disappointed with the cleanliness of my room and it was slightly elegant in it's design.  The lobby and bar felt very ""warm and inviting"" and seemed to call out to me to come have a drink.  Parking would be my only issue, but knowing the lack of parking in Charleston in general, there was adequate parking in the deck next door and they had valet as well.  The staff was very friendly.Have stayed here occasionally over the past four years. Love the service, the location and the beautiful newly redecorated rooms. However, the ""free"" in-house wifi is terrible and the upgrade is $15 a night. Not nice in a hotel where I'm paying $800 plus a night for my mini-suite. This sort of stuff really annoys me.Since being taken over by Belmond chain, the Charleston Place has gone down in every single area. The beds use to be the most plushest comfortable beds in the world. I asked an employee why they were so hard and uncomfortable now. He explained the Belmond told them to remove all mattress pads from the beds because they were down pads and some people may have allergies. The service overall was lackluster. The prices are comparable to Four Seasons and St Regis, but the service and amenities etc. are no where close to a Four Seasons. Bellman with rolling racks piled high with luggage push themselves into an elevator filled with guests. That would NEVER, EVER happen at a Four Seasons, St Regis, Ritz Carlton! Housekeeping cleans the rooms so so. The ONLY thing I can rave about is the 2 restaurants in the hotel. I am a foodie and they are both fabulous! I have stayed at least 5 times at the ""old"" Charleston Place, and unfortunately this last visit to ""Belmond"" Charleston Place was so disappointing that I will be staying at another 5 star hotel on my next visit to Charleston in September.Do NOT stay here if you are a die hard Four Seasons, Ritz, St Regis, Mandarin Oriental, Peninsula hotel fan!You will be most disappointed!I wish I could give more stars, they deserve it.First, I must warn you, 205 Meeting Street is an alley.  It is VERY easy to miss this entrance to the hotel.It is centrally located and a convenient walk to just about everything of interest in Charleston.  You can enter the hotel from Meeting Street, Market Street, and King Street.The rooms are tastefully appointed and our room had balconies on 2 sides.We were here celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and there was a beautiful bouquet of flowers with a card to welcome us upon arrival.Every employee we encountered was polite and helpful.  I wish we had been able to stay longer.   Extra umbrellas available for everyone on that extremely rainy Sunday afternoon.My husband and I went here for our ""Babymoon"" about two weeks ago and stayed for 5 nights.  Let me say the service was amazing from start to finish!  First of all, the front desk clerk decided to upgrade us to the concierge level just because he said were were, ""so nice"" upon checking in.  I highly recommend this level.  The rooms are newly renovated and pristine.  You will have turn down service and food and drinks at your disposal at any time of the day which was amazing for a pregnant woman.  Each morning my husband and I enjoyed a wonderful breakfast and would leave on our way to explore the city.  Another bonus of this place is the location.  You are literally within walking distance to all of the sights and restaurants you could possibly want to see.  If you're not sure what you would like to do, go and visit the very friendly and helpful concierge.  They can recommend everything from nightlife to historical tours to local beaches.  If you decide to stay here I would also recommend eating at the Charleston Grill.  My husband and I did the chef's tasting menu which did no disappoint.  A 6 course tasting menu quickly turned in to 10 with each dish being more delicious than the next.  Our service here was also spectacular.  We truly enjoyed our time here.  It was an unforgettable trip and we hope to one day return to this lovely hotel!Full disclosure: I had a terrible stay at this hotel initially. BUT keep reading, because they 1000% made up for it! I booked a room here for my husband's birthday a few months ago. The plan was to visit Charleston for the weekend, stay at a nice hotel and walk to various restaurants, shops and bars. What happened was a little different. Long story short, we were put into a room next to an all-night ""conference"" (aka party) for an asphalt company. They were up into the wee hours, drinking heavily and making so much noise we couldn't sleep. I complained once during the night and then again when we checked out in the morning. The manager at the desk agreed it was a terrible oversight to put guests in the room next to the conference and said he'd get in touch with me about making it right. I didn't expect to hear from him.I was wrong. I got a lovely letter in the mail apologizing and offering us a one-night stay on the house whenever was convenient for us. I was to call a specific associate to arrange it. I forgot about it for a few months before calling to make our reservation. Luckily, the woman was as nice as could be and assured me it wasn't too late. She handled it perfectly.Upon arrival, the front desk mentioned we'd be on the club level and were welcome to all the amenities included. We were shocked to find out what that entailed - an almost constant array of free drinks (soda, water, wine, beer, mixed drinks, coffee, etc.) as well as appetizers before dinner, desserts in the late evening and the nicest continental breakfast display I've seen yet! The lounge was very comfortable and grand at the same time. After dinner outside the hotel, we stopped back in our room and found a bottle of wine, a bottle of sparkling water, fresh pimento cheese, crackers and a large fruit bowl had been left along with a nice welcome note. (I already received another welcome note when checking in.) We had a fabulous time at Charleston Place and I highly recommend staying there if you can! I don't care to stay anywhere else when I'm in Charleston!Beautiful hotel in the heart of Charleston.  Our room was small but beautifully decorated.  Hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful.  We didn't eat at the hotel but did have French press coffee from room service and it was very good.  Pricey hotel but worth the money.I stayed here for a conference, and had hoped for a lovely stay. Disappointed as soon as I got to my upgraded room (which I PAID for not complimentary) the ac unit sounded like an old fridge running on high. I called down to have someone to come and look at it but after 3 calls and almost 40 minutes later no one showed up. The manager Jake was unable to deal with any of it except to put me in a worse room. So disappointed an expected so much more.","This is the best hotel in Charleston. No doubt about that. Their spa is top notch and they have a pool, whirlpool and workout room that is absolutely 5 star quality. Location is outstanding. Right in the center of the city. Tons of restaurants and shops not only in wailing distance, but actually located inside the hotel. Incredible service that is always more than willing to assist you in any way possible. The rooms are glorious and this may not be a big deal to everyone, but the soaps and lotions the hotel provides are phenomenal! My wife and I loved our stay and can't wait to get back!My wife and I recently spent 4 days in Charleston SC. This is one of 9 posts that include; The Charleston Place Hotel, Johnson Limo-Taxi and restaurants Eli's Table, Fulton 5, High Cotton, Macintosh, Magnolia's, The Mezz (aka Sermets Corner) and Sticky Fingers. Read them all to get a flavor of the city and the experience. Please take the time to see the battery, see the many art galleries and shops (our favorite was the honey store!)  and enjoy the many many good restaurants.  Charleston Place HotelA grand hotel! Everyone from bell stand to concierge to spa to housekeeping was friendly! Genuinely so!!  For example, a young man carrying towels to clean a room stopped and wished us safe travels as we waited for the elevator!. We could not say enough about the concierge staff who were very helpful with directions, recommendations and just good conversation!The hotel, pool, gym, conference rooms, our room were all clean, modern but classic. We do wish they had more chairs and better use of the lobby space so we could spend more time people watching!My wife loved the quality of food and attention at the restaurant in the hotel when she went in for breakfast and we both found the bar staff very pleasant and efficient!.We found the beds and room very comfortable! The Hotel was central to the downtown and placed in the middle of great shopping and restaurants.   We upgraded to a room with  baloney to  enjoy the fresh air - what fun!Did we mention everyone was very nice!My wife and I decided to take a spontaneous trip to Charleston, SC for a few days just before Christmas. Since neither one of us had ever been to Charleston, we decided to rely on the recommendations we found on Trip Advisor and we are glad we picked the Charleston Place Hotel. Our flight arrived at 9:30 am, so we ended up at the hotel around 10:15 am. We knew that we would not be able to check in to our room that early, so we asked the front desk if we could leave our bags with the bell captain. After we checked in, we strolled around the huge lobby, admiring the elaborate Christmas decorations and the miniature Christmas Village (including a miniature train set that kept small children glued to the scene). As we headed back over to the bell stand, the receptionist who checked us in (Natasha), came over and handed us two room keys and told us that the hotel had rooms ready on their concierge floor and that she had taken the liberty of upgrading us at no charge! Well - Christmas came early!The Concierge floor (normally a $100/night upgrade) was spectacular! It offers buffet meals and light snacks served all throughout the day and an open bar, including top-shelf spirits and a great selection of beer and wine, from noon on. We unpacked and went out to explore the city. When we returned back to our room to get ready for dinner, there was a knock at the door - the floor manager stopped by with a chilled bucket of Cava and a plate of chocolate-covered strawberries, and personally welcomed us to Charleston! I mean, I have heard of Southern Hospitality, but this was beyond any expectations.Beyond that, the room was clean and comfortable, with free wi-fi, a firm bed and soft, down pillows. The concierge staff was friendly and helpful, providing recommendations for tours, dinners and shopping. And the location, right in the middle of historic Charleston, simply cannot be beat. As kitschy as it may sound, I definitely recommend taking a carriage ride to get the layout of the city and learn some fun, interesting facts about Charleston. And don't miss dinner at Fig or lunch at Hominy Grill; two great dining experiences. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel. We'll be back - and even if we have to pay for the Concierge level upgrade, I will gladly do so. Thank you, Natasha, for going out of your way to make our stay so memorable and enjoyable - you have made us a loyal Charleston Place client for life!What a lovely hotel! Top notch shopping, (Gucci right on site), beautiful spa, attentive polite service and the updated rooms filled with luxurious comfort. Top that off with their perfect location in the heart of downtown and it would be difficult to find a better place to stay. Looking forward to returning again soon!I was there for a convention, i truly had a good experience. 5 stars it is. Not too stuffy, great southern service, wonderful character to the place, located on cemetery of town, closer to great shops, fine restaurants and many art galleries. We love it. Will be back soon.Gorgeous place. Well decorated and designed.Only opportunity is fix the heater in the room, kept clicking on and off all night, would not turn on right away.I stayed at Charleston Place for two nights for a work-related conference.  This hotel is gorgeous.  It is remodeled to give it a 17th century feel, with all of the modern amenities.  My room was small, but the decor was top notch and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds...  Ever!It's a bit pricey -- even with a group rate, it was about $300/night.  If you are okay with this price, you will not be disappointed with this hotel.All of the staff are courteous and professional and the location is great.  There are also a handful of some of my favorite shops on the first floor.  White House Black Market...  Hello!If you're going to Charleston, I would highly recommend Charleston Place.My husband and I stayed at this most gracious, friendly and beautiful hotel last September when we were attending a wedding in Charleston. It was our wedding anniversary and the staff acknowledged it with a beautiful cake and bottle of champagne. The club room was lovely as well as having the wonderful convenience of the club room itself. We loved relaxing by the pool and had a marvelous lunch in the restaurant when we arrived.The location is just perfect-near the market and near all the great historical areas and great restaurants. This year my son wanted to treat his girlfriend to a spurprise first anniversary. I spoke to Ms. Kendall Jones, a manager, who could not have been more helpful and caring about arranging a special time for them at their stay at the Belmond. I felt she was genuinely interested in making the stay at the hotel a special one and couldn't have been more caring. My son texted us that ""this is a homerun"" about the whole experience at Belmond Charleston.Our friends whose daughter was married in Charleston last year will now not stay anyplace else and they've been in Charleston at least 7 times. Hope to return again!My husband and I stayed here after we got married in August of 2014 and all I can say is that this hotel is magnificent! To begin with, no hotel has a better location in Charleston that this one. You are a short walk, rickshaw, carriage ride, or taxi ride from all of city's shopping, dining, and attractions. Belmond's Charleston Place is truly in the heart of the Peninsula (as the local's might say). At the time of my stay, the hotel was renovating the rooms and we were lucky enough to receive one of the completed rooms. The room appeared, to me, to be decorated in a French style with gorgeous whites and grays. Even the top to the furniture, on which the TV rested, was made from white granite. The bathroom was impeccable with white granite making up the floors and walls! This hotel was clean and the staff was wonderfully friendly (it is Charleston after all) and attentive. The renovations included an electronic panel on both bed sides that controlled every light in the room and bathroom! Of course it also had standard power outlets plus the USB plug for all Apple devices. The staff found out from some of our wedding guests staying there that it was our wedding weekend, so the hotel surprised us with champagne, chocolate strawberries, and a thoughtful congratulatory note. This attention to detail coupled with excellent service and a prime location make this hotel a MUST!Staff is AWESOME and soooo Friendly. We had a warm cheerful welcome from Mike, who is a cutie with a lot of swag. :-).  He showed us to the front desk where we got a big bright smile from ANOTHER cutie pie named Kevin. Both guys were so polite and very conversational with my 11 yr old son. Kevin was very knowledgable with questions I had. I have to say, they made my day.  Kevin directed me to Leah, at the concierge desk, who had her hands full with ppl and I thought she looked overwhelmed until she opened her mouth and gave me such a pleasant relax tone.... She had everythjng under control. She made sure our Bellman got the right luggage and made sure to direct us in the right direction. Sooooo Pleasant, thank you Leah :-). Our Bellman Lucas was also great. He looked tired at first, but just like Leah, he was GREAT and PATIENT. We asked to look at another room and he was kind enough to walk us down. However we stayed in our room which was pretty modern and newer. The reason for 4 stars is ONLY because I felt the rooms were a little small for $475 a night. (Due to the 4th of July weekend). Otherwise, the people who work here makes it GREAT!!I love this hotel. Perfect location for shopping and dining. The beds are uber comfortable as is the sheeting. Beautiful marble bathrooms with huge shower/tubs. Tons of counter space. My only complaint this visit is the AC sound-LOUD! I put in a complaint this morning and it was not addressed, so I re-reported problem in the evening. I was told it could have been repaired if reported earlier- frustrating....Three friends and I met in Charleston and got two rooms at the Charleston Place, and after our stay, we felt that this was a great historic hotel in a very good location in downtown Charleston. We were not very familiar with hotels in Charleston when we decided to go there, but we got a very good deal via Jetsetter and kind of rolled the dice hoping that the Charleston Place was situated well. We were not disappointed.When we got there, the valet and concierge treated us very well, and the typical Southern hospitality was in full force. Even though we made two separate reservations for the two rooms, they were able to put us together next to each other on an upper floor. The rooms were rather large compared to what I expected, and you could tell this was a historic hotel that had been there for many years. At first, the patterns on the rugs and the halls were a bit dated, but then they grew on me and I looked at the colors as more of historic charm that outdated. (The Greenbrier in West Virginia comes to mind.) I can't remember anything in the rooms that belied the age of the hotel, especially with modern amenities like an iPod docking station and a flat screen TV. Each room was large enough to accommodate for five or six people sitting around, so it wasn't a cramped room.The location is absolutely amazing and the main reason I would recommend Charleston Place. You're really in the heart of downtown Charleston within walking distance of any of the great restaurants. I think there's a big difference between staying at the Charleston Place. with its old-world charm, and just a regular Comfort Suites or Doubletree. The Charleston Place also takes up a full square city block and has a few entrances entrances on all sides. There are shops connected to the hotel as well. The on-site restaurants are rather expensive, but I would rate them separately from the actual hotel since they're actually stand-alone restaurants. I don't really have that much negative to stay say about the Charleston Place, and felt it was a luxurious place with good turndown service and amenities. Overall, I think that the Charleston Place is a great basis from which to explore Charleston and all its offerings!One star for a clean room and location thats's the only good I have to say. A big hotel with no personality. Defiantly not luxurious, which price would suggest. In need of some remodeling, AC in the room sounds like a jet engine - so much for a good night sleep.From the moment I pulled up to the moment I left, this place was more than charming, gracious and obliging!!! The amenities were beautiful and historically well kept, the club lounge, spa, restaurant and shops were all above expectations. I am extreemly grateful to Jake, in charge of customer services/front desk, for working magic for me. It is well situated in town and walking distance to everywhere. A must when coming to Charleston!! A worthy investment!The staff is extremely friendly.  The rooms are beautiful.  You can't get any closer to the heart of town. Why then only three stars?  The price. The rooms are small. And the prices are equivalent to what you would pay in NY, Paris or London at far better hotels.  The ""premiere"" rooms are just basic hotel rooms at above average price.  I understand that Charleston is hot right now but save the money on the room and fly to Paris.Good but overpriced. The rooms are nice, and beds very comfy. The service was decent. They have a cool bar but it doesn't serve food very late at all. The hotel however is very close to a lot of great restaurants and rooftop bars. The palmetto cafe onsite is ridiculous - a $26 omelette! We only ate there during our networking function, but the food was good. The conference rooms were freezing and nobody seemed able to fix it. But Overall it was a good place to stay and attend a conference.Hands-down, the best hotel I've experienced. Decided to go on a self-getaway from my family and busy life in D.C. down to Charleston. I stayed here for two nights and got a complimentary upgrade to the Club Level. Ate at the Palmetto Cafe in the courtyard of the hotel, which was amazing as well. Get the fresh blueberry mojito and the crab sampler platter.The spa was wonderful as well, but not the best atmosphere.Overall, what a grand experience. I will definitely be staying here the next time I am in in town.Except for the initial check-in to this hotel, we enjoyed our stay.  However, front desk personnel tried to upsell us.  Although I reserved a king room at least 2 months in advance, the front desk told me that they don't guarantee room ""types"".  There was no problem with a king room for the first night, but the 2nd and 3rd night we might have to move to a room with two full beds.  However, we could pay $30 more per night and move to the keycard floor where there were plenty of king rooms.  Hmmm.  If they don't guarantee room ""types"" they why do the people coming in AFTER me get my room type?  I refused the upgrade.  Then they gave us our King room and nothing further was said.  What was that all about?In a nice hotel like this it was totally unexpected.  I wasn't expecting it.  If I was, I would have demanded to see the manager, which I should have done anyway.  As a senior citizen, I didn't appreciate being jacked-around by a 20-year-old at the front desk.It ruined my impression of this hotel from the beginning of our stay.  I'll try another hotel on our next stay in Charleston.By the way, the free WIFI wasn't working.  Had to call the front desk who told me to just logon to the PAID wifi connection and they would credit me at checkout.  I did, but their WIFI requires you to completely logon and getting a new code every day.  Very cumbersome.  They did credit my room charge at checkout, but yet another inconvenience by a hotel that should have these things running smoothly.This review is for the bar/lounge in the lobby. This is the best bar I have ever patronized.  They make cocktails that are incredibly good.  Best martinis, perfect. Bar staff and wait staff are impeccable.True southern charm.  The suite is very nice and the staff is wonderful.  Great shopping choices.Totally glamorous as well as impeccable in every detail. I love the double circular old time staircase even though some of the patrons were in practice, attempting a Queen of England or Scarlet O'Hara entry. The hotel also has one of the finest restaurants as well as one of the most luxurious bars, The Thoroughbred. As for the wait, counter and bell staff; top of the notch professionals.The Charleston Place is really one of the grande dames of Southern hotels.","So glad that we ended up paying the extra money to stay at this awesome hotel in the center of Charleston. The customer service is some of the best I have experienced. We did not have a single sub-spectactular experience with a staff member of the hotel. People even remembered my name if they interacted with me more than once!The pool was amazing - heated, salt water, indoor/outdoor to let the sun through and very well kept.Location was perfect - walking distance to King St, literally across the street from market st shops, restaurants, and carriage ridesRoom - got a free upgrade to a Junior Suite, it was perfect for my family of 4, so spacious, excellent decor, and every chair/seat/bed so comfortableHighly recommend and would definitely go back!Fantastic facility with great amenities.  In the heart of Charleston, with the character of the south. You need to make this a must stay place.We were told this place was the best in Charleston and that proved to be true.  I highly recommend paying the extra cost to be on the club level.  Service and amenities were great.  The room could use an upgrade or two and better lighting, but that didn't detract from the experience.  4.5 stars.We stayed at the Charleston Place for 3 nights and thought it was very nice.  The room had been updated and looked great!  The cost was a little high ($255 per night) but the location and quality of the room helped mitigate.  The only issue we had was a lack of coffee!  There was no coffee maker in the room and the only coffee we could find was down in the lobby.  It was a small cart staffed by an outside company and charged $2.50 a cup!  A hotel with this reputation and price should consider having a coffee urn on each floor of the hotel so guests would not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby (since I was already dressed I walked across the street to Dunkin Doughnut and bought coffee and a giant muffin for $3.00).  Other than lack of coffee the hotel was great.  Staff very friendly, and rooms luxurious.  And, you can't beat the location -- between Meeting and King right next to the market.  Not a better location.  You could find a hotel cheaper but you would still end up paying $200 for some place a few miles from town.  Not worth the prices difference.  If you are staying in Charleston you want to be in the historic area close to everything.Same terrific staff but with immaculately renovated rooms and a refusal to soundproof that champions the principle of transparency but unfortunately lets in the construction noise.As Oscar Wilde once said, ""nothing succeeds like excess"" - and Charleston Place is no exception. I recently stayed at Charleston Place prior to embarking on a cruise out of Charleston Harbor and everything about this place is top-notch - from the staff and ambience to amenities and location. It certainly costs a pretty penny, but if you have the luxury and inclination to stay here for even one night, then I'd highly recommend that you do so. Charleston Place is a luxury hotel located in the heart of Downtown Charleston, within a stones throw of Charleston Harbor, the CIty Market, and the King St. boutiques. Although the hotel was built in 1986, the interior is modeled to resemble a grand 17th century residence - complete with an Italian marble lobby with a signature double arm staircase and massive crystal chandelier. The hotel has about 450 guest rooms, as well as several dozen suites. The hotel also houses two first class restaurants - the Palmetto Cafe (casual) and the Charleston Grill (formal), and a full-service spa with rooftop indoor/outdoor pool, jacuzzi, and fitness center. The first floor of the hotel houses the shops at Charleston Place, which includes names like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. During our visit, we booked a single king bed room, which was very well appointed - it also included a large armoire, desk, and sitting area with a small couch. The bathroom was spacious and well appointed. I've stayed at multiple five-star hotels across the globe, but the one aspect about Charleston Place that set itself apart from the others was the staff. I've found that the staff at these types of places generally parade around as if a stick is inserted in every orifice - much like most of the clientele. However, Charleston Place was different - everyone from the doormen and cleaning staff to the front desk and spa attendants were down-to-earth and personable. The front desk clerk even went out of his way to ensure that we had directions to our dinner destination. The only major downside of this place is the price. The going rate for a standard double or king room is around $300 per night. However, reduced rates can be found on some discount travel sites and you can expect to pay a little less if you're staying during the week. Hotel patrons do have to pay to park ($14/day), but the rate is comparable to, if not cheaper than, what you'd pay elsewhere in the downtown area. First time visitors may have some difficulty finding the entrance to Charleston Place. The hotel can be accessed via King St., but the main entrance for vehicles is situated at the corner of Meeting and Market Streets. This entrance is accessible via a side street off Meeting Street - just past Hayne St. (Chico's women's store is on the corner). Once you drive down the side street you'll see the hotel entrance - the parking garage, which is not owned by the hotel, can be accessed by veering to the right.This hotel is top notch.  From the doorman, to the lobby, to your room you know you are in a top notch hotel.  Our room was not only very clean, but very well appointed.  The only two issues I had were the TV reception was poor and the wireless internet was very slow and spotty.  If you are looking for a very classy place, the Charleston Place is the place to stay.The location is right in the heart of Charleston, an easy walk to anyplace you want to go.  They had plenty of parking that was reasonable ($12 per day) with in and out privileges.  There is a small, high caliber mall attached to the Charleston Place and a very nice lobby lounge.  If you are looking for a very classy place, the Charleston Place is the place to stay.If you are reading this review to consider whether or not to book a room at Charleston Place... STOP NOW.. And BOOK! Everything about Charleston Place is fabulous- their restaurants, location, concierge, rooms, aesthetics, and the pool /hot tub -- WOW! Yes, it's pricey, but you know the drill.... You get what you pay for, not to mention you are in Charleston so splurge a little- you won't regret it!This is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. Everything is gorgeous and has that beautiful southern charm. This hotel has great shopping, dining, and amentities. Spa and Pool were fantastic!Customer service was A +++. Everyone was absolutely amazing.Will return next time we visit Charleston.Finally a hotel that has china cabinets in the room! They get it! Now I can eat on my fine china when I'm in Charleston.Really, there was a china cabinet in my room. It was a swank upgrade to a Regular Suite from a Junior Suite after a minor snafu in the online description vs the actual room's layout. Not all Junior Suites have a parlor door separating the bedroom from the sitting area. We weren't happy and the hotel staff made it right. So kudos to them. I used the china cabinet in my new room and it was spectacular.Regardless of whether your room has a place for your fine china, the hotel is conveniently located downtown. Although the entrance is literally an alley, it has entrances on all sides of the block for pedestrians. There are trolley stops on either side of the hotel (Meeting St and King St), so it's super easy to go to the aquarium, waterfront, or Ann st without driving. It's located smack in the middle of some great shopping on King St. There's a Louis Vuitton downstairs if you need to burn some inheritance money too.There's a great pool upstairs on the 4th floor. It has a bar and waiter service. There's a large patio with a kiddie pool. There's plenty of room to catch some sun and the views are good. There's also a hot tub. There's a gym and spa too if you need to get your sweat on or get a massage on. No Happy Endings were advertised and I didn't inquire.They do have self-parking available for $14/day which I suppose isn't too bad. The garage kept my car safe and the trolley system made it so I really didn't have to drive at all.All of the staff were incredibly nice and professional. From valet, bellhop, cleaning staff, turndown service, or front desk: everyone was very accommodating. If you're not footing the bill for this place, I can't recommend it highly enough. A great place to spend other people's money!This is my favorite place to stay in Charleston.The rooms are decadent and lovely. The beds make you feel like you are floating on clouds. I want to take the pillows home with me. And the fluffy towels.The room service is good, but pricey. You really should motivate to head out to a local restaurant instead.Every member of their staff is polite and courteous.I love their fitness area. Although the gym/center is a bit on the tiny side, it gets the job done. Wear your workout clothes, take stuff to relax by the pool and head to the 4th floor. Lock the relaxation stuff in the free lockers and go run a few miles in the fitness center. Then head back to the locker room and undress to stretch out in the sauna. Change into your swimsuit there and migrate over to the pool bar to grab a drink and relax in the afternoon. This was my pre-dinner routine every day after work and I loved it.Also buy their sunscreen. It is incredible and I have never been burnt while using it. Even when I traveled to Jackson, MS mid-July!The service is incredible, the decor is to die for, and the location can't be beat.My room was also cleaned at convenient times and I was never interrupted. Once I forgot to take down the do not disturb sign when I ordered room service and they were polite enough to call me from outside instead of knocking on my door!One downside: no mini fridge in your room to take home the delicious leftovers from that place the concierge recommended you try!Stellar hotel with contemporary Southern charm in downtown Charleston.  Not like your grandmother's dowdy Southern charm but Southern Living elegant charm.  Lobby was grand and elegant and the wings had high end shops to enjoy.  Rooms were well appointed and elegantly decorated.  I loved the print of the curtain (weird of me to notice I know) - you can tell the fabric was high end.  So fortunate to have a chance to catch a last-minute HotWire deal to enjoy a stay here.Since I stay in so many hotels, I don't review very many.  Most of the time, they all seem pretty similar, but I just can't help but comment on those that stand out.  Charleston Place is a beautiful hotel in the perfect location, but what really makes this place special is the service.We operated a group travel program at the hotel and every single staff person we worked with or ran into was so warm and friendly.  I don't think I ever saw anyone without a smile on their face.  From management to banquet servers, everyone went out of their way to make sure we had a great experience.  More than one banquet server thanked me for coming and hoped that I would come back soon.  They all seemed genuinely happy to work there and it was clear that they loved their jobs.  That is unusual in today's economic climate where everyone is overworked.  I sincerely appreciate great service and these people are top notch.If you're looking for a truly special experience, I highly recommend Charleston Place.  You won't be disappointed.Very nice place!  Didn't get a chance to see everything the Charleston Place had to offer but I will definitely say that I will be coming back.  I also didn't expect this place to be as elegant as it was but was I in for a surprise!  Loved itGreat location, clean rooms.. The staff is awesome to. Stayed here twice this year.. First was my girlfriends birthday, they sent up chocolate covered strawberries! ( without me asking).. Stayed again in October, they sent up a bottle of wine and strawberries for our anniversary.  Great place well worth checking out!We checked in and went to our room and someone was in it:(( the bellman put us in another room . Our Luxury room  that was $320. a night was very tired! We were on the 5th floor where they were doing renovation:((  Next  day I found out... Workman told me that this renovation will last 3 years! Wish we had  known... The staff is very friendly and the Lobby beautiful ! This VIP customer will not be back:(Outstanding hotel and service! Great location to the city. Would definitely stay here again!Pretty much perfect. I can't think of a single negative. The service, the facilities, the location, the staff, the rooms, the bath products, the pool, the cocktails and bar snacks at the Thoroughbred, the breakfast at the Palmetto restaurant... sheesh, everything was great! Oh, ok, the only thing I would say is that voices and noise carry in the courtyard which can be a little annoying if your room faces it, but it isn't open late into the evening.I've visited Charleston many times and always stayed at B&amp;Bs or similar places. But alas,  Vendue Inn is under new management and no longer pet friendly.  So I tried my luck here.  I've walked through the lobby between King and Meeting Streets many times but never thought they would be welcoming to my four footed travel companion. The first night came a knock on the door and little voice announcing ""room service"".  I glared at Daisy the sheepdog and accused her of ordering prime rib from room service again.  I told the staffer she must have the wrong room but no,  there was a note addressed to me, welcoming us to the hotel, from the VIP manager, a bowl of beautiful fresh fruit for me, and a bowl of special treats for her highness, the sheepdog.  Knock me over with a tug toy!  Everyone was very, very nice and welcoming.  The room was lovely  (they were painting down a near hallway and I think our room might have just been painted).  Another reviewer suggested self parking and I agree.  Self parking was $16 a night, versus $32 for valet parking.  I had to do a lot of research to find a rate lower than the rack rate on the website but I did find a $220 rate with a one time $95 charge for Daisy and was more than happy with that.  Charleston is very dog friendly but it's not easy to find a pet friendly place as nice as this at any price.  We'd go back.Stayed here for 3 nights. VERY clean, great food, great staff. Expensive but worth the cost. Amazing food and restaurants in the same building. Good and free wifi (at least in our room). Recommend!","['past', 'week', 'days', 'lovely', 'place', 'everyone', 'hotel', 'tremendously', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'facilities', 'excellent', 'premier', 'room', 'clean', 'spacious', 'plenty',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-mills-house-wyndham-grand-hotel-charleston,The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,3.5,$$$,98,"#fivestarfriday, #yelpchs, #yelp843, #yelp Here it is folks my five star Friday! I've been to this hotel many times. Not to stay but to eat and enjoy the atmosphere! The have live blues on Tuesdays, and for Sunday brunch in the First shot Lounge, featuring Charlestons own, Shrimp City Slim. The First Shot Lounge is located right in front of the Barbadoes Room. Comfortable chairs and such a beautiful place.We got our drinks and decided to eat a light meal, what came next was amazing! I ordered the Johnny cakes, these are cornmeal pancakes, with roasted apples, pecans, aged cheddar, and jalapeno honey mustard. It was heavenly! My wife ordered the she crab soup it came with sherry and super big chunks of crab! she ate like she hadn't eaten before! Our server was very friendly and even when the room got busy she was very attentive. We made some new friends, and enjoyed Shrimp city slims blues. Yes the restrooms were not just clean they were beautiful! Well worth the money to go on a tues night. Come on guys you can spend a little to take your gal out for a good time! My wife and I will be back!I wanted to LOVE this place, I really did. But so many things just didn't work. Parking valet is extremely expensive at $29.00 a day-not including tip, the walls are extremely thin; I woke up several times to a leaf blower 4 stories down and my hotel neighbors talking, for as expensive as this place is there is no standard or even upgraded fridge or microwave; had to request one which was a relief but to find out it maybe fits three water bottles...No complementary coffee throughout the day, it's only free in the morning; I don't understand why it isn't there all day.. Or at least in the evenings too, bathroom grout was pretty gross; brown and mildewed, the wifi was in and out throughout my 3 night stay. They need a new bed in our room, the king sized one had two deep indents from years of previous guests...you felt stuck in it at night because of the deep canyon feeling..Pro's: Cute room decor; we didn't mind the size or the sliding doors, great location-use the free trolley that goes around town, the bathroom soaps were nice...staff was friendly...Overall, the value of this hotel simply did not add up, it is to costly for what you receive. for the amount they charge I am disappointed, go for a b&amp;b if your going to spend this amount of money.We came here for a party and I just have to say, it was awesome!  The place seems to go on and on with space, and the everyone who worked here was accommodating and gracious.  The bartenders were quick and charismatic and guests didn't have to wait long for their drinks.  The courtyard is beautiful and open and they had heaters outside in case people got a little chilly.  This is in a great location and very close to Husk and also a parking garage.  Would love to attend another party at this location!On December 12, 2015, I made reservations using Wyndham Rewards points at the Mills House in Charleston, SC for February 26-27, 2016.  On January 4, 2015, I extended our stay by one night, adding February 28, again using points.  Two separate records were made for these by the agents.  Then, on February 16, we decided to try to go down early, and wanted to add February 25 to our stay if possible.  The agent I spoke with about this did not speak English well and obviously English was not her primary language.  I was told that there was no problem in extending the reservation at the same property, the Mills House, and that is what I requested.  What happened was that the two existing reservations were canceled, and another new reservation was made in a property in Mt. Pleasant - not even in Charleston!  E-mails advising of these actions were received late last night, after business hours had ended for Wyndham Rewards.  I called first thing this morning, about 9:10 am, to see about getting the obvious error by the Wyndham Rewards operator corrected.  I was advised that no rooms were then available at the Mills House for the nights of the original reservations, and basically that I was out of luck, even though the error was that of Wyndham Rewards, and that our original reservations could not be reinstated, but that the new night WAS available!  After going through two unhelpful agents, I was supposedly put into a voicemail queue for a higher level manager., but instead was put into the queue for the Wyndham customer survey!  This didn't help at all.  So I called the customer service line for my Wyndham Rewards credit card, and after the intervention of a Barclays Bank agent finally reached a supervisory agent at Wyndham Rewards, only to be told again that there were no rooms available at the Mills House for the nights of my ORIGINAL reservations.  Since it is imperative that we be in Charleston on the involved dates and since our friends had been advised that we would be at the Mills House and some of them were staying there also, this became a major problem and embarrassment for us, even more so because I was flying out of Charleston on Friday morning to a meeting, and back on Saturday afternoon for another meeting in Charleston that evening, while my wife, who has a mobility handicap, was going to be at the Mills House on these days, rather comfortably.  After failing and refusing to reinstate the erroneously canceled reservations, our only option for using Wyndham points was. . . .a Days Inn property down the street.  Allegedly there weren't any paid rooms available for a couple of the nights covered by our original reservations at the Mills House, but I doubt the veracity of this information, since hotel managers notoriously squirrel away rooms for emergencies and VIP guests.  The last Wyndham Rewards agent who was involved was apologetic, but declined to absorb the cost of a paid room at the Mills House to correct the Wyndham Rewards error, instead magnanimously putting 5,000 more reward points into my account.I think it is deplorable, and worthy of condemnation, for the Wyndham organization to fail and refuse to correct their agent's errors.  Anyone doing business with any Wyndham group really needs to take to heart the old adage, ""Buyer beware.""  Get the name and identifying number of any agent you deal with, but even then , don't expect a reservation error made by Wyndham Rewards to be corrected.This is a pretty decent hotel in a fantastic location.  Only two bad things to say so I'll get them out of the way first:1) The rooms have barn door style doors for the bathroom; those are the type that hang on a bar on the wall with visible hardware and don't actually fit flush against the wall.  I have no idea why anyone would ever want to put one of these on a bathroom, but that's what the designer for this building did.  What it means to you as the guest, is any sounds created in the bathroom are going to be heard by anyone in the hotel room, which is really fun if you have a guest hanging out in your room, or you're doing your morning business with your wife sitting right outside the door.  Really stupid; all I can say.  I'm giving them three stars instead of four because these doors made it awkward when I had friends in my room that were on vacation with us.2) The woman who appears to own and operate the hotel gift shop independently of Wyndham is extremely grumpy.  My wife had one item in her hand, and before picking up more (which she'd have not had enough cash for), she asked if they take credit cards.  The woman's response, in a terse manner, was ""Not for that amount"" referring to the one item she was holding.  We decided to put the item back and not give her any business.Now, the good.  The rooms are very nice and clean.  They're well lit and the bed was very comfortable.  The regular guest room has a desk with top-mounted outlets, two chairs, table, dresser and nigh stands.  There's a steaming iron in the closet and hair dryer in the bathroom.  The TV had a decent number of channels.  If you're a light and late sleeper, I'd request a high floor or a room not on the west side of the building.  We were woken up around 8:30am on a Saturday by someone dumping a large quantity of recycling bins with glass bottles on the back side of the hotel; we were on floor 7.Every staff member we encountered was very courteous.  We requested a fridge for the room and it was there five minutes after we got to the room.  They gave us a free late checkout without even having to argue.  There is valet parking available for a fee.The on-site restaurant and bar are not much more expensive than places you can walk to, so that was a nice feature; normally we stay at Hyatt where I'm used to getting fleeced if I dare try the on-site dining.  However, no reason to eat on site, right out the back door are two restaurants (Husk and Poogan's Porch) that have managed to maintain four and five stars on Yelp even with hundreds of reviews, they're simply that good.  We ate at both and loved them.In addition to those two out the back door, there are a very large number of bars, restaurants and historical features in easy walking distance, including the huge outdoor/indoor market Charleston is known for.  It was my first trip there; I left thinking it was like a clean version of New Orleans with more history and less smell of garbage and piss.I booked 3 rooms at this hotel for a bachelorette weekend for my friend. There were 12 of us total, so 4 ladies per room. The booking process was smooth and I was able to reserve 2 rooms for 3 nights and 1 room for 2 night (some were arriving a day later than others). This worked out very well and they were very accommodating of allowing me to leave the ladies' names at the front desk so each one to get her key when she arrived. They were also great about letting me put all the rooms on my credit card even though I wasn't the first one to arrive (I had a flight delay). The front desk was super friendly. The lobby was beautiful, as was the outdoor courtyard.The rooms themselves were regular hotel rooms, nothing too special about them. Each of the 3 rooms I got had 2 double beds (wish they had been queens!). It was a bit pricey, but I suppose the pretty lobby and amenities like the nice hotel bar and the pool had a role in that. The location was also great and we were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go.Our biggest complaint overall was about the bathroom doors in the hotel rooms. They didn't close all the way! Sounds crazy, but it's true. They were sliding doors, rather than hinged doors, and they left about an inch gap so they did not fully close. Therefore if you wanted any real privacy, you were forced to use the bathroom downstairs in the lobby. This was pretty annoying. Another thing that would have been nice is if there was service at the pool. If you wanted drinks or food you had to go down to the bar and order it there and then wait for it and bring it back up to the pool. I wish they had servers up there. Other than that, it was a great hotel with a lovely courtyard to have some drinks in (and the food from the bar was pretty good too).There is not a shuttle specific for this hotel that picks you up/drops you off at the airport, HOWEVER there is a general shuttle at the airport that will take you to any hotel you want for $14/person. I had called the hotel prior to our visit to ask about airport shuttles and they said there were none, and while there aren't any specifically for this hotel I wish they had told me about the general shuttle -- luckily I found out about it when arriving at the airport which saved a lot of money instead of having to take a cab.I would recommend this hotel for a couple or a family, but if you're friends and need some privacy with the whole bathroom situation, I might look elsewhere (it wasn't just our bathroom -- we asked the front desk and were told that's how they all are).I recently stayed here for a business meeting and was impressed with the all areas of the hotel - the sleeping rooms, suites, public areas and meeting rooms.  The facade of the hotel was currently under renovation or repair but that didn't detract from the experience.  I'm sure it will be beautiful when completed.  The lobby was very grand and staff was very helpful - front desk, concierge, manager,  valet and convention sales staff.  I dealt with all of them and all very good at their jobs.  The sleeping rooms are a bit small,  but for a 2 night stay I wasn't in the room enough to really affect me.  The only complaint I had was that the bathroom door was a pocket door (on a track that slides open) and it kept sliding open.  It was very cold outside and I was relying on the steam from the shower to keep it warm in there.  I was able to rig the trash can to hold it closed and advised the front desk so they could have maintenance look at it when I checked out.  The Robert E. Lee meeting room on the second floor had French doors that opened to a private balcony.  That allowed us to let some fresh air in and take our breaks on our private balcony, which was a nice touch.  My favorite part of the hotel is the courtyard off the main bar and the pool and patio area above it with the wrought iron work on the balconies.  Being a New Orleans native,  it reminded me very much of the courtyards in the French Quarter back home.  I'd stay here again, hopefully when I have more time to visit the city and just be a tourist.Loved this Hotel.  The only inconvenience was the prices were less expensive on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a> and they couldn't match it at the desk so I had to step out of line book online.  You would think if they have empty rooms they would give a deal to fill them.Stayed here this week and enjoyed the hotel overall. It was winter and cold so I didn't get to enjoy the outside areas of the hotel. It's centrally located for Husk and Poogan's Porch restaurants which are right across the street. I got a deal on the room, $161 for a king. The room was small but enough for a one night business trip. Parking is $28 through the hotel I think, there is a parking lot next to Poogan's Porch that costs $20 overnight. Overall I would pay $200 a night in the spring/summer. I think there rack rate average is $259 so I may not stay here unless I get a deal.LovedThe look,LocationOf the hotel.Sliding bathroom doors makes little sense though.Location, location, location! We scored this hotel for $159 a night, so from that price perspective we were very happy. I would be much more critical if we'd paid a high season price. Parking: Valet is $29/day and gives you in/out privileges. The public garage next door is $2/hour or $20/max with no in/out privileges. There was also street parking and a 30 minute loading area. Room Service: We decided to splurge on room service for breakfast one day. Who doesn't love breakfast in bed? It was a steal in my book - $13.95 for: Eggs, choice of meat, bread, juice, coffee, hash browns. Couldn't even finish it all! 2 people could definitely share. Staff: We didn't interact with the staff much, but they were friendly on check in and explained our parking options to us. Room: Pretty decor and the bed was really comfy. The bathroom was just ok, they could use some deep cleaning as mentioned in other posts. The strange thing was all the noises we kept hearing in our room - could it be ghosts? Yes the hotel is haunted!Room Tip: try and stay away from a street side room - not sure if it would help, but we were street side and heard the garbage trucks super early every morning. Overall I would definitely stay here again for a bargain price like we got this time! You can't beat walking everywhere and having great restaurants across the street!Wow!  This Wyndham property was a delight.  The hotel itself is gorgeous- inside and out.  Check-in was quick and easy, and we were given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite.  Our room was spacious and comfortable.  We really loved how close this hotel is to everything in Charleston, we walked everywhere!   We cannot wait to return in the spring.My husband had a conference here and we really enjoyed our stay. This hotel is super conveniently located. We walked to practically everything. The rooms are small but well done. My only complaint is the lack of counter space in the bathroom. The restaurant/bar in the hotel is great and we enjoyed sitting in the courtyard for drinks in the evening. I did get to spend some time by the pool which was very nice as long as you weren't wanting shade. We would definitely stay here again. Can't say enough how great the location of this hotel is.I recently stayed here one night as a wedding I was attending was held downstairs. The venue was a typical ballroom- sunset cocktails on the terrace were cancelled due to inclement weather.  I must say the food was tasty from the cocktail hour apps to the entrees. Service from catering staff was professional and friendly. Location wise this is perfect for a venue such as a wedding. We walked steps away to the church and many shops and restaurants are located close by. There is of course valet at the hotel or self parking which leads directly into the hotel (separate cost and not affiliated with the hotel). The room itself was a standard suite with a King sized bed, flat screen tv, iHome charging station and gilchrist and soames toiletries. Slight annoyance, there wasn't a towel rack in the bathroom so you have to drape towels above bath tub/shower. I would consider staying here again only if bed and breakfast options were sold out. Price was $ 226 a night with special wedding block pricing.Room service the next morning was prompt and tasty. We ordered the American breakfast and pancakes. All the accoutrement accompanied our meals which I found pleasing.Wonderful stay.  Comfortable, clean, nice staff, nice dining area.   In the heart of everything, restaurants, shopping, historic district.Wow!  The location could not have been any better.  The staff was always professional and friendly.  (Especially Monique when we first checked in.).  This was our anniversary and they made the trip such a memorable one.  The room and lobby were beautiful.  It was a special treat for us, but when we can afford again....we will definitely stay here.My boyfriend and I had a fabulous stay at The Mills House! The location was perfect- just close enough to dining on E Bay and shopping on King. The staff was prompt and polite every time we encountered them, and they were always willing to give us suggestions of where to go and what to do. The only (emphasis: ONLY) thing I would have changed about our stay was the sliding bathroom door in our room. It didn't close completely every time, and there was no lock on it. Not a huge deal when you are traveling with someone you're close with, but it was annoying nonetheless.great location for downtown charleston.Very close to great shopping and sights.The room was a little small for the price.Great hotel! What a perfect location to explore the city. The exterior of the hotel is lovely and the lobby is in perfect and updated condition. Check-in is smooth and professional as was service in the bar and on the patio. Rooms were nicely updated but as mentioned in prior reviews...small. The bathroom shower needs updating. Otherwise everything else was wonderful. Thanks for a memorable stay!Wonderful stay. Velma was fantastic and helped us get settled.  Kevin is also a rock star shuttling bags all over the 6th floor.  Best team in Charleston!!!","If having a clean bathroom is important to you...DO NOT STAY HERE.  When we arrived, I checked the room which was small, but very pretty and clean.  Then I checked the shower/bathtub.  The grout was mildewed and the tub was streaked.   Also, the area at the bottom of the toilet wasn't clean, nor the area on the floor behind the toilet.  I called the front desk and they sent someone from housecleaning right up.  She went to work in the bathroom, and after 10-15 minutes, came out and let me know it wouldn't get any cleaner. Now here's the thing, I live in a great, old apt that was built around 1950.  It has all the original tile in the bathroom.  I admit that I do have to use Tilex and scrubbing bubbles, and I really work at it, but I GET MY GROUT CLEAN!!!  This hotel needs to do one of three things:1) Provide their cleaning staff with the proper cleaning products and training, or2)  Replace the tile, grout and tub in the bathrooms (because apparently they all are this way) or3) Charge no more than $70/night for these rooms, because a room with a nasty bathroom SHOULD NOT COST ANYWHERE CLOSE TO $300.00I won't be back, and I will never recommend this hotel to anyone.This review is for the key lime pie ($7) in the lounge. I have eaten my fair share of key line pie in the south (mostly Florida) but this has got to be the best I've ever had. More tart than sweet, which is just the way I like it, and a perfectly chewy crust. It's made by their pastry chef, who in my opinion deserves the title of Key Lime Pie God. Fun fact: key lime juices are really bright yellow, not green. Makes you think about the usage of food dye in most pies.This is a stunning hotel with a haunted past. Supposedly you can sight a woman from the nineteenth century in a purple dress between 11 PM and 1 AM in the rear lobby area. Burn victims were nursed to health in this very location in the 1800s after a major fire consumed much of the city. This female phantom is believed to be one of the burn victims from that time period.Whether or not there is a ghost inhabiting the premises, the Mills House is worth checking out for its grandeur and charm. It's quite lavish and everything you'd come to expect of a beautiful, older hotel. It makes a perfect backdrop for pictures.I can definitely see why The Mills House makes a great wedding ceremony and/or reception site. It's just beautiful.If you have the cash to burn, consider booking a room here. But you've been forewarned that you may meet an undead guest.Perfect place for an out of towner making their first trip to Charleston. Great location and service. The rooms are clean and spacious. The fitness room is a bit small but it has anything you may need. The restaurant downstairs serves a killer breakfast as well if you are in a rush! Would definitely book here again if I end up back in Charleston!I want to rate this hotel as a 5 star. But while I'm typing this review, alternating between roaming and four bars of internet connectivity, I think back to three mornings ago. The morning that my wife went to the pool and I stayed in the room. The morning that in spite of the 'Do Not Disturb' tag hanging on the door, housekeeping walked in and saw me excitedly, but mistakenly, welcoming my wife back to the room. C'mon, fix the wi-fi and teach your staff to read...Second time in Charleston and second time at this great hotel.Staff extremely friendly especially the concierge who was there the last timewe were in town. She was extremely helpful in making dinner reservations eventhough it was Easter Week and the town was packed.The room was great and do not let some of the reviews fool you.  Just ask fora refrigerator and one is sent to your room - no charge.  Once you park yourvehicle you do not need to retrieve it until you leave.  Everything is withinwalking distance. This has to be the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in.Being built in the mid 1850's the walls are solid. Housekeeping was excellentNext time we go to Charleston - The Mills House is our place to stay.For my first visit to Charleston I wanted to stay where I could walk to lots of things.  Since the Mills House Wyndham was one of the cheaper ones for the 4th of July weekend, I went with that.Our room was on the 7th floor and from the window we had a good view of a parking garage!  Also to the side you could see the water.  But I wasn't there for the view anyway.... Other things about the room:- nice big comfy king bed.  I had reserved two beds as my friend and I were staying together and we are strictly platonic, but they were out of those rooms for at least one night of the stay.  So whatever, the king bed was big enough that it wasn't a problem.- Flat screen HD TV- Decent hair dryer, not one of those attached to the wall hair dryers- Coffee maker in room with Wolfgang Puck coffee- Small bathroom without a lot of counter space to put your makeup and other items - I'm sure I freaked my friend out with all the accoutrements I brought with me- no fridgeOverall it was pretty good place to crash at night.  Room was always cleaned after we left and plenty of towels were left behind and plenty of TP.  What more can you want?As for the rest of the hotel, the lobby was gorgeous and I was in love with the chandeliers throughout the lobby area.  Plus the lighting fixture in the elevators had me transfixed.  It was modern in some areas but kept some of the old school feel since this is a historical property.  There's a bar in the lobby and it is beside a nice outdoor courtyard where you can enjoy the nice weather.This place was nice and was conveniently located walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do.  Thus it was great!I'm livid right now. I spent most of my time in Charleston at a lovely bed and breakfast that was more than accommodating. Our final night was at The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel. It was fine. The staff was standoffish to us...borderline rude when we checked in. Check out was the same way. Our stay was nothing to write home about. We were out and about mostly, but the one thing that would have been nice, our room didn't provide us. A small refrigerator to keep our leftovers. For such an expensive hotel, you'd assume they'd provide the basics. The reason I'm so ticked off is because I discovered a $50 charge on my account from the hotel. I paid for our room in advance via <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and didn't do anything at the hotel to incur these charges. When we checked out the woman said, ""you have no charges so you're good to go."" Now a $50 charge? So, I call the hotel to figure out the mistake. The woman who answers the phone is unbelievably rude and sends me to someone's voicemail, doesn't even tell me she is transferring me. One of the options is to press zero for personal assistance. I do so and am redirected to this gem of a human being who is now QUITE frustrated that I am bothering her at her job and tells me, ""if she didn't answer then she's in a meeting. Leave a message."" She transfers me again. What service!! If you're going to be unhelpful at least be POLITE while doing so.This Hotel is Perfect !!! We loved everything !!! Gorgeous Hotel in best spot in town , close to everything , walking distance to everything. Friendly Staff and great service , the Architecture is beautiful and it has such a great feel : so Southern and Charming! Delicious Coffee (free) every morning in Lobby. Loved the Bar and Terrace Patio with Fountain. Loved the Pool with towels ! Loved the view from our Room 6th floor. Right across the Street from Husk restaurant. Bed was sooooooo comfortable !!! Bathroom is CLEAN , dont' know what that other person is talking about ??? In fact, they clean room twice a day ! My only small negative is the gym: it needs a makeover, the doors to the pool don't open - what a shame, i had a great workout on Treadmill then wanted to step out onto lovely terrace at Pool but door was locked , would be great if Doors opened - like, go for a run , when jump in pool without having to walk all the way out and around. Gym needs music piped in, and a jump rope would be great too . If you are looking for a casual , inexpensive Brunch/ or Lunch- i highly recommend Brown Dog Deli on Broad Street , very close to Hotel . Thank you . We loved this Hotel!Good location and staff.Bad- most everything else.Classic bait and switch with room category. Booked poolside, website said only three of these special rooms available. When I realized I was in a different category room, I was moved to a poolside room, (day 2) there were 5-8 of these. Placed next to loudest ice machine in Charleston. Noises started daily between 6 and 6:30 am. Banquet people moving furniture, floor polishers, etc. (they claimed it was a truck outside, but I beg to differ)Over $400/ night with taxes for 6 nights.Pillows smelled like smoke, paper thin walls, vibration from a/c , trickling water sounds in bathroom all night. No fridge, etc.Don't waste your money on this place unless you are deaf.A good hotel in a great location. I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff was very friendly and the rates are pretty good.Fantastic place to stay. Only negative was no fridge in the room. Other than that, it's location is central to everything in Charleston. The staff working there were incredible. The courtesy and friendliness of everyone working is something everyone desires when they stay somewhere. The interior is very classy and old fashion. The rooms were clean and cleaned daily. There were ample towels. The pillows were also amazing. Soft, yet dense and heavy. I slept like a baby and would stay here again, no question.We stayed in the Hotel for 4 nights from December 27-30. We had a corner room with many windows which would have allowed a fabulous view of the city. However, this was not to be.  From the day we checked in the entire Hotel was under construction with scaffolds and painters everywhere.  We had to keep drapes closed constantly due to the workers outside our windows. They would begin work very early in the morning, so there was never a chance to sleep in. The bathroom was very small and absolutely no space for personal items.  The breakfast buffet was just bad. Rubbery scrambled eggs, greasy cold sausage, bacon. The courtyard might have been an nice place to sit and have a drink, but with all the ladders, scaffolds, and workers yelling at each other it wasn't.There are so many lovely Hotels in Charleston to choose from and this is NOT ONE  of those. We will return to either Charleston Place or Planters Inn. Was never offered a construction discount. This work should never have been done at the Christmas Holiday busy season.Great location! My husband and I stayed this weekend and had a wonderful experience. The valet and bell staff were very attentive and efficient. They let us check in early (9am!) and helped us to our room. The room was very clean and comfortable. Great bed and pillows. For the room, service and location it was a great price! I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel!Perfect location, beautiful exterior and interior, king bed was extremely comfortable, the room was very clean, staff was very helpful and friendly, awesome pool, and the valet service was very nice to have.  The only negative we had was the wi-fi was horrible.  Internet did not work for the two days we were there.We've stayed here twice now and I think it has become our go-to Charleston hotel. The price is decent and the location can't be beat. The hotel itself is upscale and I really have no complaints. The parking situation. Could be better though. I tell all my friends coming to Charleston to stay at Mills House.I stayed in this beautiful hotel during Charleston's busy season (summer) and it was excellent. The location is great - it is only a few minutes from Charleston's shopping and dinning area. When I stayed there, there were in the midst of renovating the whole hotel. Luckily, I stayed in one of the finished rooms and it was great! The rooms are decorating in soothing blue and white hues; request a corner room, as they tend to be a bit more spacious. The lobby has been renovated to a more modern look while maintaining the quintessential Southern hospitality feeling. All of the staff members were very helpful and courteous - they even go so far as to learn your names while you're staying there! If you stay at Mills House, do yourself a couple of favors: 1) have a drink in the lovely courtyard, and 2) have lunch or dinner next door at Poogan's Porch. This is a great hotel in a great city...you can't go wrong with either of them.Absolutely the best spot to stay in Charleston if you like to walk in the historic district and shop on King Street. My family has been coming here for decades and, admittedly, the accommodations have declined through the years. Wyndham took it over from Holiday Inn and recently renovated all of the rooms. We despise change, but the rooms were overdue for an update. The saddest part of the redo is the Barbados Room restaurant. The menu is uninspired and quite abbreviated. The modern decor in the hotel and restaurant makes it difficult to remember that you are in one of the most important cities in the American Revolution and Colonial America rather than on South Beach, Miami. They are repainting to the old Mills House pink on the exterior as I write this. Hopefully, they will continue their efforts to be more historically accurate on the interior as well. Other reviews mention a lack of cleanliness. That has certainly not been my experience on this or other visits. We have been impressed with all of the staff--especially the housekeeping and restaurant staff. If you are like me and you love find that the soaps and lotion make staying in a nice hotel even more enjoyable, I can assure you that you won't be disappointed! They smell good enough to eat!Really 3-1/2 stars; it should be better than OK; because of some service issues, I'm not a fan.  We were in town for a small-group business meeting, and experienced the hotel proper, their meeting rooms, catered breakfasts, and bar.The rooms are smaller than in other properties, but so what.  You're one block from the center of Charleston, right on Meeting Street.  The rooms are quiet the decor is quietly charming, and the lobby is marvelous and bright.  The meeting room we used fronted on Meeting Street, with large bright French doors, that we could open.  Very few hotels boast such an experience.  There's a beautiful courtyard on the ground floor, and a terrace with pool on the second floor.  Both are great!On the flip side, the ventilation system in the meeting room on our first day had a noisy buzz.  The staff tried various adjustments to the thermostats, but couldn't make the room quiet.  Fortunately, they fixed the problem overnight, so our second day of meetings was quiet.  Good marks for the fix, but why was the noise there in the first place?Second service concern was the courtyard adjoining the bar.  We were a group of approximately 20 persons, meeting for a planned hour-long ""drink before dinner.""  The early arrivals had adult beverages in hand.  Those arriving a few minutes later had to find the wait staff to place an order.  Then we waited some more.  Some went into the bar to re-order; the bartender was harried and surly.  Those waiting outside asked  the manager for assistance.  Finally, the rest of the drinks arrived, 10 minutes before we needed to depart.  One comment about reservations; it's a popular place, so book early.Location is what it's all about! Walking distance to the waterfront, Battery Park, tons of museums, shopping and restaurants is the plus with the Mills House. Rooms were a tad dated and walls were paper thin but we were only there to sleep, really. Staff is GREAT. One suggestion, bring earplugs and the thin walls won't be an issue.","An historic hotel with a few signs of its age, but in a fantastic location for access to all the best food, shopping, and historic sights in downtown Charleston.You'll feel right at home in the seat of the deep south as you walk past the well manicured courtyard, complete with fountain, and into the hotel with its large chandeliers, dramatic staircase, and heavy use of patterned upholstery on the furniture and window treatments.  Bellhop staff will greet you at your car during normal business hours and usher you into reception.  I found all of the hotel staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers, to be quickly kind and genuinely excited to help.  The bell staff, however, stands out for their continuous morning greetings and quickness to lend a helping hand.  This team of guys never uttered the word ""No"" during my recent 3 day stay and were always willing to work within my crazy schedule.  I do agree with other Yelpers, however, that the concierge staff was rather conservative and traditional with their advice- not likely to appeal to a younger, hipper crowd looking for options outside of the mainstream or off the well beaten path.  I was also a little taken aback with their use OpenTable to find reservations.  There's an app for that.  No special calls direct to the vendor?  At least the advice always comes with a smile!The absolute best amenity, however, is the location.  One block from all the shopping on King Street, an easy walk down Meeting to the Battery and the waterfront, 3 short blocks from all the best restaurants on East Bay Street, and a quick walk to the open air Market and all the accouterment that comes with it.  You are literally surrounded by history and it it all just a few blocks from you.  The city just begs for a daily stroll from the front door here.Rooms are pretty standard, though most I have seen do have furniture that echoes the downstairs with very traditional pieces that tend to clash with the modern flat screen TVs throughout.  Bathrooms, though, are on the small side with a slow draining tub-shower combo and little counter space for spreading out.  This, however, is expected of older hotels.  They have been updated and my most recent room was perfectly clean, so it comes with the territory.  Another common worry with older hotels were electrical outlets: hard to find and weirdly controlled by wall switches.  Not great for working in the room, but again, somewhat expected in an older hotel.  Same for lighting, lamps are great but the lack of overhead or wall lighting was a slight let down.  Again, however, I found everything to be clean and it was clear these old bones were given the best makeover possible the last time renovated.My best insider tip: valet parking currently runs $22 a day, but just off Queen Street is a public parking garage for a fraction of the price that connects directly into the hotel via the 2nd floor!In all, this hotel has the feel of a grand old classic that has been cared for and fixed up for modern times.  It's location and staff make it a go to when I'm in town and I'll gladly return soon.Good location. Nicely renovated. Reasonable price for the area. Avoid any rooms in the center of the building, along Queen street. The AC units on the roof make significant noise on every floor!!  Very annoyed that we had to ask to be moved when other less noisy room options were available. Front desk had to know about the noise, since the made service recognized it as a continuous noise that is always there. Would stay again, but only if staying at the Meeting Street end of the building.Great clean and affordable hotel. Near enough to the water, 1 block from King Street, and tons of good restaurants (Husk, 82 Queen) and bars (Bin 152). The hotel bar stays open for a decent time, great selection of bourbons and brown spirits.The staff is friendly and helpful, the concierge won't suggest very far or uniquely out of the way places for food or fun, so do your own research. It's worth befriending a local for more unique ideas for Charleston fun. The Valet attendants are very nice, *give them a solid 20 minute notice in the morning if you need your car ready by the time you get downstairs. The hotel is quiet, but our room was on the outside corner and we heard trucks every morning, not a great location if you are a light sleeper. The pool is a good size and very warm (in July). Also recommend a room on a higher floor if in the back, otherwise you have a balcony, but on the same level as the pool.Would definitely recommend this hotel.The entire staff was outstanding. Seeing Clarence the Bellman was always an extra treat as he brimmed with happiness that lights up the place. The only area of improvement is the waitstaff at the hotel bar. All 3 nights we had different servers that seemed indifferent (not rude or unfriendly) but just didn't seem to care that we were there. The rooms and common areas were beautiful and the decor was amazing. The gym was lacking and pool area very nice. We would definitely stay here again.Staying here right now ... wouldn't recommend if you're traveling with anyone. The room bathroom doors are on sliding wheels, don't fully close ... Not a romantic / comfortable setup. Walk away ... Just walk away. It's almost laughable ... Walk a. way.My fiance and I spent the night in Charleston and it was between this hotel and another one, we opted for the Mills House and were very pleased with our experience. The hotel is lovely inside and the hotel staff was a pleasure to work with, they were very sweet and had southern charm. There is a deck with a pool and plenty places to sit. After a night of going out, my fiance and I decided to have one last drink out there (which was still open). The king sized bed was AMAZING! I think I have a pretty comfy bed at home, but this felt like sleeping on a cloud and it was quiet (sorry no ghosts when we stayed). We did not have a view, but to be honest, I did not care because we did not spend time in the room and we weren't there for a view anyway. This was a great experience and will def stay here again. You are in walking distance from the main attractions. We walked everywhere.Nice, clean, classy hotel within walking distance to tons of great food, shopping and sightseeing. Staff was very kind and accommodating. Only two complaints: no refrigerator in the room &amp; a very small bathroom with limited counter space. Other than than those two very small things, neither of which are deal breakers, it is a lovely hotel. I would definitely stay here again.This is a great hotel. Beautiful old-style Charleston feel, but still clean and updated inside. The bed was huge and the room was spacious and comfortable. The lobby and outside courtyard were very beautiful and romantic.Cute little pool and restaurant if you just want to relax. You couldn't' ask for a better location. A block away from shopping on King Street in one direction and a block away from some of the best restaurants in the other direction. I will definitely stay here again.Had a quick 2 night stay in Charleston and couldn't have been happier with our hotel choice. The hotel and rooms are beautiful. Bell staff was very helpful and friendly in pointing out places to go during our short stay. The hotel is also walking distance to most sight seeing places. We were able to walk to great restaurants for dinner. Would recommend this hotel to any and everyone!This hotel has a great location for people that like to leave the car behind and walk on their vacations. The room and breakfast were about what was expected. We came here for our 1 year wedding anniversary so we knew it would be a special trip. Our first night there was Saturday 07/12. Apparently they were hosting a wedding in the ballroom and decided to not put the wedding party on the floor above the wedding. Instead of doing that and having nobody disturbed deep into the night by pounding music, they put people that were not at the wedding on the floor directly above it. It seemed like the whole floor had people that weren't at this wedding.I went down to the front desk to see if we could switch rooms because we needed to wake up early but they told me all rooms were booked. I asked why they woudnt put the wedding guests directly above the wedding so that they wouldn't have people trying to sleep that are stuck hearing the noise. He told me ideally it would work that way but it didn't happen...He gave us vouchers for breakfast the next few days which was really nice and also said he would talk to him manager about giving a partial refund for Saturday night since it costs over $300 just to sleep there but we weren't able to sleep, so why were we paying that much?I didn't get a refund but I did have a $600 hold on my credit card for an entire week after leaving. I'm not sure what that was about but at least it is gone now.We also reserved a room with a king bed. Maybe they have different definitions in the hotel industry like how different stores have different clothing sizes, but we did not have a king bed.I stayed here for four nights on a recent vacation to Charleston and had mixed feelings about this hotel. On the plus side, it's in an excellent location and is within walking distance of tons of historic sites. My room was small, but I wasn't expecting anything huge in a historic building. Also, I didn't hear any noise from adjoining rooms, which was good.That said, my room was on the second floor and overlooked Queen Street. There was a HUGE amount of street noise every night and morning because of this (even though I requested a quiet room). For one thing, there are two restaurants directly across the street, so you hear people from there--patrons talking as well as workers throwing out trash, etc. Then the garbage trucks come by at the crack of dawn and are deafeningly loud. Ditto for food delivery trucks delivering to the hotel restaurant. It's possible the noise might have been deadened a bit had I been on a higher floor, but I kind of doubt it since the hotel isn't that many stories. I was able to soldier through using a white noise app on my phone, but this hotel is definitely not made for light sleepers.My room was clean when I checked in, but I noticed that the cleaning of it while I was staying there was pretty slipshod. No vacuuming occurred at all and they never changed my sheets. I don't necessarily have a problem with that, but most hotels leave a little card or something explaining that they will not change the sheets unless you request it--something of that nature. No such card existed here.Other random observations: The decor in the lobby is very nice, but I noticed that the lobby area had a sickening smell pretty much continuously--kind of like perfume that was covering up something disgusting. I ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant one morning. It was adequate but certainly nothing special. As another reviewer mentioned, the valet service is very slow. They do warn you to give them a 20-minute heads-up, however.I wavered between 2 and 3 stars for this hotel, but ended up giving it three because of location. But beyond the amazing location, it's not so great. Next time I visit Charleston, I plan to stay somewhere a little more off the beaten track to avoid so much noise.Nice rooms. Friendly staff. Historic charm. Southern hospitality. Conveniently located. Great base camp for a days walking.This is a very beautiful hotel in a great location!  Convenient to many great restaurants in downtown.  The rooms are a little small but very nice.  The service was fantastic from the valet, bell hop, etc.  The breakfast buffet had some really good food, including personalized omelets.  The outdoor patio with fountain was beautiful in the evenings with the lights.  Their key lime pie is fantastic!  My only complaint would be that the bathrooms are small with only a pedestal sink which makes getting ready a little challenging.  Overall, we had a great stay and loved this hotel!The staff is very friendly, but won't let you make very many choices. The hotel itself looks good on the outside but on the inside Its rough. The rooms are small and not sound proof, the rooms are very expensive, and the elevators are slow. The hotel is also exposing, the storage room was wide open with no staff near and if I was the manager I wouldn't want the guests to see the storage room. It just made it look bad. It does have a good location, but bad and hard to find parking.Wonderful service! Hospitality was a dream. Rooms were adequately clean. And if you ever need a thing the concierge is a phone call away. And will make sure that you are pleased 100%I think my heart sank when I saw my Hotwire choice for a 4-star hotel in the historic area of Charleston was a Holiday Inn.  Let me assure you though, that this is nothing like any Holiday Inn I have ever stayed at.  They may lend their name to this property, but the influence ends there.  The Mills House is a bona fide, first rate, international class hotel.  It is absolutely beautiful and a really lovely place to stay.  Our room had a super comfortable bed replete with luxurious linens.  Every and all amenities were provided.  This extended to valet car service and even complimentary umbrellas to use during our rainy stay.  I didn't get a chance to try the restaurant at the hotel, but it is quite a popular spot in its own right.  This was precisely the kind of place where you want to have a long stay.  To compare it with other hotels, I would say this hotel was in line with Sofitel.  Very charming place that I highly recommend.  Hotwire Summary$107 + $21.34 = $128.34 / nightRack rate:  $374/night + taxObviously book through Hotwire if you can; but if you can't, it's definitely worth the much higher price per night.This place is AWESOME......said no one ever. If you plan to hold an event here or have already booked this place, cancel now you wont regret it. If you want to be told no to every request you have and pay a huge price for poor service, this is the place for you. I gave it one star because there wasn't a negative scale. The hotel is outdated, service is horrible, food is decent, and prices are outrages.Worst hotel stay ever. $150 single King bed. Construction in room across hall from my room. Nothing mentioned at front desk. A note in room said construction from 9-5. Lucky me construction started 7:30. Fitness room was under construction.  No amenities.  Beautiful small room &amp; hotel &amp; great location. Thank goodness for Hyman's seafood being within walking distance or my night would have been terrible.Please do not connect ""Holiday Inn"" with the Historic Mills House Hotel.  This jewel of Charleston history was where John C. Calhoun met with some friends to help draft the articles of secession.  It happens to be administered by the Holiday Inn, but is more of an Inn that you would holiday at rather than a commercial experience of any kind.A nice restaurant, bar, lovely seating area, and conveniently located in the heart of Charleston.  Walking distance from everything that matters.Loved the hotel because of the location. The room was a good size and it was very clean. When we called down for extra pillows they were up within ten minutes. Every time we left the room, when we return it had been tidied up. Everyone was helpful with sight seeing and evening told us about a really cool pub that the locals go to. It was very goth...if you are a grits lover try to hit up all the diners and do a grit crawl before you start the pub crawl.","A very nice historic hotel with great service. The location was awesome.Very beautiful historic hotel. The location itself deserves five stars. A little pricey, but very nice overall.Okay, seems like my original review was deleted (somehow). So, here I go again. Overbooked. We checked-in and were greeted with rather ""cool"" reception by a mediocre front desk agent who didn't explain anything .. parking ... how to get my room ... nothing. We were place in a room that seemed unusually small for the price we paid. After not sleeping well, the first night, I woke up at 5:00AM and inquired about our room. At that point, I learned that the hotel was overbooked and we were placed in a smaller room without knowing that we were flagged to be moved the next day. Not only were we charged that first night for the larger room, but if I had not asked about the room, we would have been charged the full price of a larger room while being placed in a smaller room for our entire stay. Next ... construction. We didn't know that the hotel was being renovated and there were workers moving up the side of the building where we were placed (smaller room). It would have been ok had they told us, but no one told us and I learned of the construction/renovation the next day by hearing voices outside our 7th(?) floor window.  Now ... ants. When we were finally moved to our new room, we found a nice little colony of ants on our office area desktop (by the lamp). I killed several and left the bodies where they were so that maintenance could see them as this type of thing is very unusual for a high-end hotel.  Next .. late room service. We ordered early morning breakfast room service to be delivered between 9:00 and 9:30. The food arrived at 10:00 AM and the deliver charge was not removed and the order was wrong. I wanted to give the delivery person a tip, but I was so disturbed by the late delivery that I didn't. I'm glad that I didn't because I saw that the order was wrong after looking at the food. Next ... shoddy phones. At least one phone in each room didn't work. So, when I needed to confirm something with the front desk, in the original room, I had to walk back to the front desk. Very annoying. In addition to all of these issues, the hotel decided that Saturday morning, during check out time and breakfast, was the PERFECT opportunity to take down decorations and dismantle the lobby Christmas tree. NOT! This was definitely a poor management decision as the sound of noisy guests and power drills was rather unsettling. Personally, I would have scheduled this work to occur in the afternoon ... maybe after lunch and before dinner. So, overall, I would say that this place has only managed to stay in business because of its location. Move this same operation to some less notable location and I would predict that they would be out of business or under new management within a few years. Oh .. did I mention that all of this occurred during our honeymoon (New Years Day/Weekend). Therefore, unfortunately, we have the Mills House to thank for a jacked-up honeymoon. Some of the staff were really nice, but that aspect alone is not or was not enough to eradicate the memories of a less than stellar experience at a high-end hotel. We probably won't be back.What a fabulous hotel - probably the nicest I have ever stayed in!  Fancy and comfortable and located right in the heart of historic Charleston.  We had a great view of Chucktown.  The Gibbes Museum of Art was right outside my window.  Lovely bathroom, plush beds.  Free fountain pop machines right on our floor.  The decor was very fancy and classy... chandeliers everywhere.  We did the valet parking.  Checking in and out was fast and efficient and staff was friendly.  We stayed on the 7th floor, which required a key card in the elevator.  There was an outdoor pool on the second floor, so we enjoyed a very refreshing night swim one night after a busy day touring the city.  There was a very beautiful courtyard with a fountain... we took lots of pictures here because we were just so impressed.  We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant, the Barbadoes Room, one morning.  It was good and convenient, but again... in a hotel restaurant, you pay for the convenience.The Mills House Hotel is one of the many spots in historic Charleston rumored to be haunted - and let's just say - after staying there, I concur.  However, this wouldn't keep me from coming back.  The location is a dream!Overall a wonderful hotel where we would stay again and recommend to others!Negatives:  The room we booked on the Queen Street side was very small, so small that we could not pass one another between  the foot of the bed and the furniture without turning sideways. We will book a larger room next time.The bathroom was even tinier. The door hit the bathtub and two people could simply not get into the bathroom at the same time, and we are average to small people.The carpets in the room and in the hall were stained and in great need of replacementConstruction was happening so during the day in our room when trying to nap we heard that noise. We were simply too tired to ask for a different roomThe restaurant and bar service was slow and I was served water in a stem that had lipstick stains on the rim. The bar does not make Sangria.:)No concierge service after 5 p.m.Positives:An outstanding location, centrally located in downtown, just north of Broad Street, and almost everything is within walking distance.The hotel has a beautiful lobby, common areas, lovely parlors with some period antiques, and is architecturally superb. The staff were very friendly and helpful.The doormen were always available to help open transportation doors and to let us know when our driver had arrived. They were friendly, always smiling and helpful.Concierge was very helpful when available.The history and the ambiance is second to none.The food in the Barbadoes Restaurant was very good, and they open early for breakfast (6:30 a.m.),We inadvertently checked out before we had printed our airline boarding passes, so the staff made us a key to access the business center, even offered to print the passes for us.Rooms are priced economically.Overall we would stay there again and enthusiastically recommend the hotel.Nice hotel in a really convenient location.  For the $149 rate I paid, the room was clean and decent.  Free wifi was fast, but the $25 valet parking was a punch to the gut.  Staff was very friendly and attentive at the front desk and the bar / restaurant.  Would stay there again for the value.The location of the Mills House is great - very accessible to lots of places.  The room was nice - nothing too fancy, fairly standard, but that was good enough.  It did a nice, large king bed at least.  Nothing too negative about it - the only things are:  the bathroom door kept getting stuck and once my girlfriend couldn't get out...but I came to the rescue!  and the shower drain backed up with water as soon as the shower was turned on, so had to stand in a few inches of water while showering.The courtyard dining area was very nice.  We had a drink there in the evening and breakfast there in the morning.   The food was great and the service great, as well.The front desk left a little to be desired.  They weren't rude or anything, but didn't encompass that Charleston hospitality we got everywhere else.  I guess I could say they were efficient.  To their credit, they called us the minute we got to our room to alert us we left a cell phone at the front desk.  That was very much appreciated.I'd stay there again!I tried to like this hotel - I really did... I am forced to up my zero star to 1 because the staff was very upbeat and friendly &amp; it is a nice hotel on the surface.  The breakfast is very good (not earth shattering) but good &amp; a good value for hotel breakfasts.  Now, peel away the surface and discover the grit underneath......  We had made our reservation a full month in advance of our stay.  Our flight was delayed coming in to Charleston (unfortunate - but it happens) &amp; when we arrived we were directed to our room (612) = (stay away) on the 1 working elevator.  What should have been an easy 1.5 hr. flight &amp; check in turned into a nightmare.  Because we were the last to check in, we were given the adjoining room to a suite with a PULL OUT SOFA BED as our king bed (that I confirmed a month prior).  When we tried calling down, our phone was not working either.  The manager, Alfonce, indicated how sorry he was &amp; that he would make it right, unfortunately after numerous attempts to contact him &amp; have him rectify our $280 per night bill, he never made good on his promise.  Nights 2 &amp; 3 were somewhat better in a different room (I can only imagine some other slob typing the same letter I am now about being the last one to arrive after they gave them room 612) - In any case our new room had drainage issues in bathtub (felt like I was back in my college dorm with my pre-balding roommates &amp; a clogged bathtub) and a non-working in room movie service.  Once again, @ $280/night I kind of expected more.  I'm totally fine with the $19 Caesar Salad, the buffet breakfast and the desk staff.  I just wish Wyndham would have a room that has a bed when they say they will.  I don't think it is much to ask at all.  I'm done.  I also disputed the charge on my credit card - so I can leave it to the big boys to fight in the sandbox to see if I get any green back.  The city of Charleston was awesome......very friendly peole, great food &amp; great vibe.  I'll be back, just staying &amp; spending my hotel money elsewhere.I cannot believe this is a Holiday Inn.  Thank you Hotwire for giving us this hotel and at a discounted price!  I was amazed.  This is a first-class hotel in every way.  It's charming and just beautiful.  I only wish I had more than one night here!   It's also very centrally located to everything downtown.  Just use their valet and leave your car parked and you can walk around or use the free trolley to get anywhere around the Downtown area.  It's really just a beautiful hotel, you won't want to leave your room or your bed!Highly recommended!And MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" is broadcasting LIVE there in the few days before the South Carolina Republican primaries! Go over and say hi to Willie for me!I find the positive reviews about this place to be shocking.  My husband and I stayed here on a recent trip to Charleston, and we could not have been more disappointed. This is a rare example of Yelp pointing me in the wrong direction. We arrived late in the evening on a Sunday night. The place was dead. No one there except for the girl behind the desk. I'm not sure if its because I got a great deal on Priceline or what, but we got the absolute worst room in the place. It had two double beds (which proved to be super uncomfortable) and a walk-in shower. The bathroom was small and dingy. We did not have a need for the walk-in shower and prefer a king-size bed. We went to ask for a different room, but were told that there were no rooms available. This hotel was definitely not full. We could hear the crickets chirping as we made our way back to our sad little bed. There are much better places to stay in Charleston.Great location! The downstairs is beautiful but the rooms are a little outdated with poor lighting and the bathroom was small. The bellhops were GREAT and very friendly. The concierge was so helpful and got the younger bell staff to tell us about the local bars... Like Tsunami has $1 Blue Moons every Thursday! My friends and I loved the staff. We booked this hotel through Hotwire.My stay here was great!  Could not be in a better location.Location is everything when you're a tourist and you can't beat the Mills House location and great rates.  It is within easy walking distance of all the attractions and restaurants south of Marion Square.This is no Ritz or Four Seasons.  But the staff was helpful, the bar was hospitable, and the rooms were large, clean and had good views -- and did I mention the location and the rates?We had a mini-family reunion with four rooms for four nights and people ranging from teenagers to octogenarian.  And we were all pretty happy.  I'll stay here again when I visit Charleston.Only minor irritants:1.   The amount of time it took to get the car from the valet parking.  When they tell you to call 20 minutes in advance, they are serious.2.  The wireless connection is painfully slow.Hint:  with the Holiday Inn frequent flier card you get a free drink per night per occupant at the bar.In town from San Francisco &amp; wanted a historic hotel, but with some music in the evenings &amp; had read this hotel had a piano bar.  When I called to book I asked about the piano bar &amp; the front desk clerk said ""we have a piano, but you can't play it"" so we decided to try the Charleston Place Hotel instead.  Perhaps, the staff at The Mills House could use a tad more training or at least be supplied with the definition of piano bar.Just finished an enjoyable stay at The Mills House Wyndam Grand. Fabulous service - we were given a lovely poolside room upon arrival at 11am. Bellmen were friendly and helpful, room was well appointed. Pool was well maintained and decor was charming. Breakfast in the Barbados room was good and wait staff helped us get our food and get out quickly to start our drive home. Would absolutely stay here again!We have stayed three times now. I like this place a lot. The rooms are clean and quiet, the common areas very pretty,  the location is wonderful.  Perfect for touring around and walking to most places downtown. The parking garage (city run) is pricey and they do not let you come and go meaning you can pay a lot to park there if you take your car at any point.At Best, Aspirational Mediocrity.Let's start with the good parts: The location is great, the bed was comfortable and the porters and valets were really on top of everything.To get a sense of the overall quality of the hotel, remove those factos and set everything else do dismal. The back office is either idiotic or completely apathetic, I'm not sure which is worse. There is no tact or plan whatsoever in the execution of even the most basic tasks. The rooms are tiny and in desperate need of rennovation. The drains in the bathroom are slow to the point of near unusability. Whatever request you may have, rest assured the answer will be no.This is the second time we have been here and is just as memorable as the first time we were here almost 5-6 years ago.This time we were on the 7th floor in a bigger suite.  The complimentary soda dispenser on the 7th floor is a nice touch.  The maid service were very polite and went out of their way to see if we needed our rooms restocked with water.The rooms were plush with canopy beds, plush carpeting and thick curtains on the windows.  The ambiance of the place made it seem more expensive than it really is!  Spoke with the Concierge and she was very helpful in trying to make recommendations on where to go for certain things.  Spent an hour at the hotel bar one night and the place was nice and relaxing.  We also had breakfast the last day we were there. The portions were small for what you paid for, but the fruit was fresh and what you would expect at a place like this.This place has a lot of history and character. You can stay at other places, but this hotel has a some great history and is located to everywhere you want to be. The next time we stay in Charleston we will stay here and recommend this place to our friends.Great place to stay - right in the middle of downtown - everything easy walking distance.  Very friendly staff - breakfast was included in my room which was quite reasonable and the room was great - parking was also included in an underground private lot - I was there for 4 nights in July 2010 - did not move my car once - I walked and walked everywhere and did a whole day a/c bus tour of a plantation and then local downtown historic Charleston - they pick up and d/o and the hotel arranged it for me!They also have a happy hour each evening - cheap drinks/wine/beer and free cheese/crackers/fruit to snack on - I would stay there again, anytime.This is the BEST Holiday Inn you'll stay at. It's not your father's Holiday Inn. This is a historic hotel with remodeled rooms, so your bathroom is gonna be a little cramped, and your room a little on the small side. But what this room lacks in size it greatly makes up for in class and style. The hotel advertises a few bars: I only tried the main bar in the lobby. It's a beautiful bar, offering full service, with big comfy chairs and and all around peaceful ambiance. There is full room service (limited hours, though) and a well prepared concierge -- thumb through the ""book of restaurants"" in the lobby off the concierge desk. This book has all the menus of the restaurants you might want to visit.....(and then follow your ""Yelp instincts"" and read the reviews!). Good experience at this hotel, and you're in the thick of where you want to be for dining, drinking &amp; shopping.","My review is based on the entertainment aspect of the hotel.  I attended a wedding and I have to first and foremost say huge kudos to the bar staff and the wedding planner.  They smiled all night and did not miss a beat.  They were friendly and on top of their game all night.  The food was out of this world.  Not healthy buy any means but the spinach ravioli in the creamy pesto was yummmmmy!  A very nice experience.while trying to escape being snowed in we got last minute rooms here and one was upgraded to a suite which was appreciated.  We weren't ablt to get our rooms on the same floor but since it was Christmas weekend I understand that.The beds were very comfy and we had plenty of pillows.  The concierge, bell, and valet did a great job!The bathroom sink was VERY slow to drain and we had some noise even on the 6th floor from construction on a building next door by 9:00.I love the locale and would be very willing to stay here in the futureFor the money, worst hotel i've stayed in.  Mold in bathroom, light and toilet paper dispenser falling out of wall, wallpaper peeling off.  What you would expect for a $60 hotel but priced at over $300 during holiday weekend.  Much better options in same area of town, which i've stayed in.Great hotel!! Amazing staff willing to do anything for you from valet, housekeeping to front desk. Just because it has a Holiday Inn flag does not mean anything!The hotel is no longer a Holiday Inn, and the new owners are planning a remodel later in the year.  The common areas downstairs are in great shape but the rooms are showing their age.  However, it was quiet and comfortable.  It's within walking distance to many great restaurants.Pros: - friendly staff, they upgraded us because we mentioned it was our anniversary. So nice!- The water pressure is great!!- Location is superb, right in the middle of the historic district. - bath and body works shampoo that smells delish - lobby is beautiful, very grand and ornate- they have a nice bar downstairs themed after the famous train in charlestonCons:- Parking is $25 per night. Here's a tip, just drive your car to the garage behind the hotel and you will pay half that. - Carpet was ripped in the room.- They accidentally double charged us for parking, and if I didn't look at the bill; which I usually don't. I never would have known. The front desk guy says it happens all the time. Weird. - the rooms are kinda small, not updated, and really nothing special- it's true, the lobby smells a little funky; I'm pretty sure that this is a charleston thing. You can smell it in other places in the city too. I'm not sure if it's  due to the gas lanterns or a sewer issue, but it's not a pleasant smell. That said, my boyfriend didn't even notice it, so I guess it depends on how sensitive you are to smells. It's typically something I notice. Other reviewers were unhappy with the noise, but we were poolside and didn't experience this problem.What an amazing hotel in an incredible location. This hotel boasts some amazing history and charm. They have done an incredible job restoring it, and the renovation they completed not too long ago turned out perfect. I stayed on the 5th floor with a few of the building next door, and a view of the church steeple. The staff is extremely kind and some have been there for 10-30 years, some are several generations. They have pictures where Robert E Lee stood at the hotel on the balcony. It is a very historic hotel in a prime spot. The restaurant and bar are perfect for the hotel, and the courtyard with the fountain is beautiful. This hotel adorns classic elegance combined with employees that really cared.We enjoyed our stay at the Mills House. When we arrived our room wasn't ready so the staff upgraded us to a city view room. That in itself was amazing!!! The location was perfect for our first trip into Charleston. My only complaint is that the bathrooms are small and they have no counter space. Ladies...you'll have to do your makeup on the desk. The restaurant downstairs is pretty good, the service isn't quite up to the standard of what you would expect from the hotel. Check this place out when you head to Charleston, and you can get great rates through Priceline.When we booked a stay at the Mills House, we were not told that it was undergoing extensive renovation.  On our first full day staying there, I called the front desk to ask what floor the gym was on, as the hotel website indicates a fitness center on premises, and was told it was under renovation and we could go to a gym a few blocks away (a 10-minute walk) that the hotel would pay for.  There was also a letter in the room indicating loud noise from 9am-5pm due to construction.  Separate from the renovation issues, every time we left our room there were a number of housekeeping carts in the hallway that we had to dodge to get to the elevator -- at all times of the day.  The room was very small and the bathroom had no counter space for toiletries or other items.  Finally, when we checked out, no one asked us how our stay was (we would have told them!) and they billed us the wrong amount.  It took 15 minutes for them to find the priceline booking, correct the rates, and refund our credit card.  The hotel is incredibly convenient to restaurants and nightlife, but that is about all it has going for it.  Perhaps when the renovation is done it will be better, but they could still use some better customer service training.Stayed here for 3 days for our 25th wedding anniversary.  Used my Priority Club points so I made a call to ensure I did not get a standard room because I wanted this to be a special weekend.  The staff was excellent. They upgraded us to a suite on the 7th floor and the conseirge arranged to have a lovely arrangement of flowers waiting for my wife when we arrived.  I can not say enough about the staff.  Did not need to use my car the entire stay since the hotel is within walking distance to everything. When I the valet brought down the car, I got in it and it would not start. Within minutes he was back out with a jumpstart powerpack and we were on our way. This is not your typical Holiday innAwesome hotel.  This is NOT Days Inn and I'n not sure why 'Holiday Inn Hotel' is in the name of this hotel.  It's just the Mills House.  If you're going to stay in Charleston, this is a great location, off the busy streets, but close enough to lots of great restaurants and some of the fun tourist stops.  While you stay here, be sure to have brunch or lunch across the street at Poogan's Porch.We stayed two nights (Aug. 2010)- location can't be beat-walking distance to everything. Parking was pricey- we found a cheaper lot down the street, and it was a challenge to unload in front of the hotel (we ended up parking in a garage first.) Very comfortable bed. Hotel was recently remodeled, but unfortunately you can still sometimes hear noise from other rooms. The bar was a great place for drinks, and the courtyard was a charming place to relax. We requested a fridge for our room, which was OLD and stunk like cleaning supplies. The pool was good for both adults &amp; kids. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly.Beautiful, beautiful hotel in a great area. It's in walking distance from many of the main attractions. Great outdoor patio for enjoying a cold drink on a hot day.OK - I didn't stay in a balcony room like Aileen B., below, but my co-worker did.  She DID have a ghostly experience in the balcony room!!!  She reported that a washcloth flew across the room all by itself.  This was verified by her Aunt Jenny, who was also in the room at the time.  Her Aunt Jenny does not lie!  Scary!I have been going to the Mill's House for years and I love the hotel. My wife and I have been going there for our anniversary for 22 years. This year we made our reservation and with confirmation in hand showed up at 4 pm on our arrival date. We were immediately told they had bad news and good news for us. They were overbooked and could not accomdate us, but they were going to pay for a room for us down the street at a Holiday Inn. They gave us no advance warning on this and thought that a standard Holiday Inn would suffice. While the hotel itself is beautiful this type of service ruined it for us. We do not plan on returning. Basically they ruined what was a very special weekend for me and my wife. Thanks Mills House!Just got back from a 3-night stay at the Holiday Inn Mills House Hotel.  It was absolutely gorgeous!  A lot of antique furniture and period (re-created) furniture.  The hotel is pretty much the most historic hotel in Charleston.  Several tours we took stopped at this hotel and all had stories about it.  Robert E. Lee lived in it for a while also which is pretty cool.The prices are kinda high (just over $200 per night -  considering it's a Holiday Inn Hotel), but given the gorgeous and historic grounds, it is well worth the stay.  We managed to snag a balcony room that was right outside the pool.  There was a gorgeous patio right outside of our room with rocking chairs, a sofa and a small table.  You could drop down the curtains for privacy or leave them open to catch the warm breeze.  Very cool.  There's also WiFi here.  And it's right in the heart of the downtown/historic district.My only real concern was that on our last night there, I think there was a ghost haunting our room.  It really made me irritated to no end, since I saw its shadow floating around the room prior to laying down in bed.  As soon as I got in bed, I was laying on my side and felt a pressure like a hand on my left shoulder.  I then turned on my stomach and felt a heavier pressure from my neck to my butt.  I then turned onto my other side and felt what felt like someone grabbing my right bicep with an open hand right in the middle of it.  I gave up trying to move around after that.  Every time I would try to open my eyes though, that shadow was passing in front  of my line of vision.  I seriously thought I was not going to be able to sleep.  I kept telling the ghost or spirit or whatever it was that I was a nice person and to please leave me alone so I can sleep.  Finally, after over and hour of this, I was able to crash hard.Now, I don't use drugs.  I had two drinks over about two and a half hours prior to this, so it wasn't that either.  I have never before had an encounter with a ghost or spirit, so this kinda freaked me out.  But it was also an interesting experience all the same.The staff at the hotel are all very pleasant with a real feel for the southern hospitality.  They are really accomodating and I did not have problems with them at any time.  The bar is a little pricey, but they pour good drinks.  Another 5-star rating for a great place!I'm not reviewing the hotel's rooms, and I'm not reviewing the hotel's restaurant.  What I am reviewing is the bar, and the adjacent and lovely courtyard.  My mom's partial to a ""restorative"" bloody Mary when hungry (oh, in the early afternoon), when we're in ""fun"" mode (as opposed to business mode), of course.  And the Mills House is a favorite of hers, and rightly so.  There really is nothing like a good Bloody Mary at exactly that time in the courtyard.  Four stars for that.Really enjoyed  our stay here. We stayed for two days. Front desk staff were extremely helpful and accomodating. They even charged my cell phone for me because I ran off and left my charger at home. Great location. We were able to park and walk everywhere we wanted to go -- the aquarium, for example, and the Old Slave Mart and the historic Market Street market. Our room was clean and cozy. Bathroom was surprisingly small but not a big deal for me. There was some street noise at night but I had expected that. I mean, we were in the middle of downtown Charleston. The free cucumber water and lemonade in the lobby were a nice touch (and quite appreciated after dragging myself in after walking around the city all day!) . The only drawback to staying here was the expensive parking -- $20 a day. I hated having to pay that. But all in all, it was worth it. I will definitely be recommending this place to friends and family.","['yelp', 'folks', 'five', 'star', 'hotel', 'many', 'times', 'eat', 'enjoy', 'atmosphere', 'live', 'blues', 'brunch', 'first',
